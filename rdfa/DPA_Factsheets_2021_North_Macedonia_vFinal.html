The Open Data Strategy sets forth measures to be undertaken to encourage the release and use of public data and implement them broadly to contribute to raising the transparency and accountability of State institutions. More in detail, North Macedonia&#x2019;s Open Data Strategy aims to develop a dynamic open data ecosystem in which data are produced, opened, enriched and reused by multiple actors from the public and private sector, civil society and academia. As a result, the Strategy will lead to improved public service delivery and public sector efficiency, increase public engagement, support efforts to combat corruption and contribute to the creation of an innovative climate that delivers new economic opportunities for the business sector. </p><p>The Strategy provides for the deployment of a central government <a href="http://data.gov.mk/mk/">Open Data Portal</a> and defines a methodology for data inventory and conducting an inventory in State institutions. In addition, the Strategy introduces a licensing model for data, establishes a management structure and guidelines to facilitate the release of datasets, raises awareness and fosters the creation of public value through collaboration and partnerships with stakeholders from within and outside the public sector. </p><p>The Strategy also contributes to ensuring that North Macedonia meets the EU requirements on government transparency and accountability, and most specifically the goals set with the Directive on the re-use of public sector information and other measures supporting the opening up of public sector information.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Fourth Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership of North Macedonia </p><p>In September 2018, the GRNM adopted a fourth <a href="https://mioa.gov.mk/sites/default/files/pbl_files/documents/strategies/strategija_za_otvoreni_podatoci_mk_0.pdf" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership 2018-2020</a><span resource="https://mioa.gov.mk/sites/default/files/pbl_files/documents/strategies/strategija_za_otvoreni_podatoci_mk_0.pdf" property="dct:title" content="Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership 2018-2020"/>. Just like under the previous action plans, for the following two years the GRNM committed to increase efforts to make public institutions open, transparent, accountable and efficient.

During the last decade, significant attention was paid to reforms aimed at better providing public services. Considering that competition in the private sector contributed to an increased quality of service provision for end users, Macedonian citizens expect the same from the public sector. In this context, the <a href="https://mioa.gov.mk/?q=en/node/2381">Public Administration Reform Strategy 2018&#x2013;2022</a> aims to develop digital settings that provide easy access to eServices and contains dedicated measures regarding electronic identification (eID) and trust services, specifically in its SO4 on service delivery and ICT support to the administration. In addition, SO3 implies building a functional infrastructure for the delivery of eServices to clients through the digitisation of all required components. The measures to be taken for this priority are the following:</p><ul><li>Introduction of an electronic identity for using eServices in accordance with good European practices and the conditions in the country;</li><li>Digitalisation of service registers, prioritising core registers that are not in a digital form, harmonising the legal provisions with the needs of digitisation and digitising registers in accordance with the adopted and existing standards, as well as maintaining, applying and updating the Population Register. When designing and implementing the application solutions that will use data from digital registers, technical, administrative and organisational measures will be applied to reduce the risk of unauthorised access to data in the registers; and</li><li>Strengthening of the mechanisms for availability of public information related to the implementation of Article 10(1) of the Law on Free Access to Public Information (2019), in alignment with activity 6.1.5 on monitoring of websites of holders of information. To fulfil this priority, in 2020 the websites of 121 State administration bodies were analysed. All of these State administration bodies are information holders according to the law. Based on the established methodology, the monitoring of 11 categories of documents that the institutions are obliged to publish is in accordance with Article 10(1) of the new Law on Free Access to Public Information.</li></ul><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Cybersecurity Strategy and Action Plan 2018&#x2013;2022</p><p>The <a href="http://mioa.gov.mk/sites/default/files/pbl_files/documents/strategies/cyber_security_strategy_macedonia_2018-2022_-_eng.pdf">National Cybersecurity Strategy 2018&#x2013;2022</a> was first adopted in August 2018, while the <a href="http://mioa.gov.mk/sites/default/files/pbl_files/documents/strategies/ap_cybersec_v1.13_eng.pdf" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Action Plan 2018&#x2013;2022</a><span resource="http://mioa.gov.mk/sites/default/files/pbl_files/documents/strategies/ap_cybersec_v1.13_eng.pdf" property="dct:title" content="Action Plan 2018&#x2013;2022"/> was developed by the end of 2018.

Moreover, the system is compliant with EU directives and supports all forms of public procurement. All public institutions and businesses can register with the system and obtain the obligatory digital certificates for posting tenders or sending bids. The latest version of the system, optimised for the newly adopted law and procurement procedures, was launched in 2019. Furthermore, the ESPP introduced an open data module on the public page, providing the general public with aggregated data on a number of procurement indicators. The PPB continues with the further development of the systems&#x2019; modules and the enhancement of the existing ones, significantly simplifying and facilitating the use of the application. The system covers all contracting authorities on both central and local level, and all stages of the procurement procedure:</p><ul><li>Publication of the annual procurement plans;</li><li>Market analysis (technical dialogue);</li><li>Publication of contract notices;</li><li>Questions and answers by the economic operators during the period for the preparation of bids;</li><li>Submission of electronic tenders;</li><li>Electronic evaluation and clarification of tenders;</li><li>eAuctions (optional);</li><li>eAppeals;</li><li>eAward;</li><li>Publication of contract award notices and scanned contracts;</li><li>Publication of the contract amendments with scanned changed contracts; and</li><li>Publication of the notice for contract realisation.</li></ul><p>Considering the above functionalities, the ESPP is the main tool providing transparency and efficiency in the public procurement system in North Macedonia. </p><p>In 2020, the PPB started developing a new platform only aimed at conducting small&#x2011;value procurements in a simplified and effective manner. The specific objective is to introduce two new innovative electronic tools for procurement: eMarketplace and eCatalogues. In particular, a new software platform should be developed for efficient electronic conduct of small-value procurement for goods and services up to the national threshold of EUR 10&#xa0;000. The new platform will be supplementary to (and connected with) the current ESPP and is expected to be operational in 2022.</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p>The information systems of all institutions providing eServices also offer electronic payment with virtual POS terminals. One of the first introducing ePayment was the One-Stop-Shop Portal for eServices for Legal Entities, including among the provided eServices the registration of legal entities.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ePayment for eServices</p><p>The <a href="https://uslugi.gov.mk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="national eservices portal" resource="https://uslugi.gov.mk/">National eServices Portal</a> offers an ePayment feature for the fees and administrative taxes due, in total, for the eServices requested on the portal, regardless of the institution issuing/delivering the service. The portal sends a package of data for each different payment to the bank chosen for payment transactions and clears each individual payment order to the Treasury or commercial banks. The necessary data for the payment form are part of the data relating to each service in the Catalogue of Public Services. The procedure for ePayment when applying for eServices is described in a bylaw of the <a href="http://mioa.gov.mk/sites/default/files/pbl_files/documents/legislation/zakon_za_elektronsko_upravuvanje_i_elektronski_uslugi_0.pdf" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="law for electronic management and electronic services" resource="http://mioa.gov.mk/sites/default/files/pbl_files/documents/legislation/zakon_za_elektronsko_upravuvanje_i_elektronski_uslugi_0.pdf">Law for Electronic Management and Electronic Services</a>.</p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Learning Management System </p><p>The <a href="http://e-obuki.mioa.gov.mk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="learning management system (lms) portal" resource="http://e-obuki.mioa.gov.mk/">Learning Management System (LMS) Portal</a>, offering eLearning for administrative servants, enables SCORM packages to be uploaded and made available to all public servants. eCourses include a test, with a certificate generated for the participant if passed.

The register provides a unified and unique way of managing individual databases based on established standards and procedures. In particular, the National Population Register represents a single integrated data register for all citizens aggregating data on the entire population, and thus enabling the implementation and monitoring of public policies in the domain of population management and planning. In addition, the National Population Register provides access to personal data for the purpose of public services provided by competent authorities. Moreover, this initiative is a key milestone in the establishment of the national eID, as well as the provision of digital services to Macedonian citizens. With the National Population Register, a unique electronic number for persons (EEBG) was also introduced as mandatory information to access given personal data from the register. The key data providers are the MoI, the Ministry of Justice - Office for the Management of Registers of Births, Marriages and Deaths, and the Central Register of the Republic of Macedonia.</p><p>As a result, Macedonian authorities have access to a single official and reliable data source for population-related data, where each person is able to access and verify the personal data that is used for administrative proceedings by administration authorities. Importantly, this ensures compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Register of Rare Diseases</p><p>The <a href="http://mojtermin.mk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="register of rare diseases" resource="http://mojtermin.mk/">Register of Rare Diseases</a> records and monitors patients with rare diseases as well as data on therapy/medicines for rare diseases.
