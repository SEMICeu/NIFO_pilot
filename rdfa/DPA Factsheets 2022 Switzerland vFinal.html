It will provide a secure legal basis for the trading of rights through electronic registries. Furthermore, the segregation of crypto-based assets in the event of bankruptcy will be clarified by law. Finally, a new licence category for DLT trading systems will be established in financial market infrastructure law, thereby creating a flexible legal framework for new forms of financial market infrastructure.</p><p>On 25 September 2020, the Parliament unanimously adopted the bill. On 11 December 2020, the Federal Council brought into force, with effect from 1 February 2021, the parts of the DLT bill that enable the introduction of ledger-based securities. In addition, from that date on, the Ombudsman affiliation requirement applies only to those financial service providers that serve private clients.
