The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations.

The ordinance establishes a comprehensive legal framework for the shift to &#x2018;electronic administration&#x2019;, creating <strong>simple </strong>and<strong> secure electronic interactions</strong> between citizens and public authorities. The text covers all exchanges of electronic documents and emails or digital communications among public authorities, and between citizens and the central administration, regional governments and private organisations. Moreover, the ordinance grants <strong>emails</strong> the same legal status as traditional paper-based correspondence and legalises the use of electronic signatures by public authorities. Lastly, the text stipulates the provisions on both the security of exchanges and the <strong>interoperability</strong> of information systems. </p><p>Since the adoption in 2005, several articles have been abrogated and/or modified by the law and other ordinances in order to adapt to the permanent evolution of the society in terms of electronic and digital exchange. </p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">General Interoperability Framework</p><p>In 2005, an Ordinance set-up the <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/interoperabilite/">General Interoperability Framework</a>. The framework includes recommendations, norms and standards that promote interoperability within administrations&#x2019; information systems. The framework promotes the interoperability of the information systems of those actors that wish to interact to go beyond simple bilateral arrangements. An updated version of the framework was published in 2016.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on the Modalities of Reuse of Public Sector Information</p><p>The purpose of the <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000031701525&amp;dateTexte=20180315" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law on the Modalities of Reuse of Public Sector Information</a><span resource="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000031701525&amp;dateTexte=20180315" property="eli:title" content="Law on the Modalities of Reuse of Public Sector Information"/> is to promote the reuse of public data.

This Law complements the regulatory and non-regulatory measures as well as tax measures that are incorporated into the 2019 Budget Law. All these measures make up the <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/action/pacte-le-plan-d-action-pour-la-croissance-et-la-transformation-des-entreprises" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Action Plan for the Growth and Transformation of Enterprises (PACTE)</a><span resource="https://www.gouvernement.fr/action/pacte-le-plan-d-action-pour-la-croissance-et-la-transformation-des-entreprises" property="eli:title" content="Action Plan for the Growth and Transformation of Enterprises (PACTE)"/>. The PACTE has two objectives: making companies grow so that they create more jobs and redefining the place of companies in society to better involve employees. From creation to transfer, the PACTE removes obstacles, simplifying business creation and easing workforce thresholds. In particular, entrepreneurs&#x2019; lives will be simplified thanks to the creation of a single online platform for business formalities. The PACTE is a new step in the country&apos;s economic transformation and the fourth phase of the economic reforms initiated by the government more than two years ago. The Action Plan is in line with ordinances for strengthening social dialogue and the tax reform initiated by the <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000036339197&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id">2018 Budget</a> Law.

The law aims to bring together the digital and ecological transitions. It aims to make all digital actors accountable: citizens, businesses and administrations. It has five objectives: (i) raising awareness on the environmental impact of digital technology; (ii) reducing the renewal of digital devices; (iii) promoting environmentally friendly digital uses; (iv) promoting less energy-consuming data centres and networks, and (v) promote an environmentally friendly digital strategy at the local level.</p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big Data </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud Computing</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Circular &#x2018;Cloud au centre&#x2019;</p><p>In July 2021, the French Prime Minister adopted a circular which sets out a doctrine for the use of cloud computing technology by the French State, called &#x201c;Cloud au centre&#x201d; (Cloud at the centre).

The State&#x2019;s digital services must now be hosted on one of the two internal interministerial public clouds or on cloud solutions provided by private companies, while considering strict security criteria when processing sensitive data.

This <a href="https://api.gouv.fr" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="catalogue of apis" resource="https://api.gouv.fr">catalogue of APIs</a> is primarily intended for service creators and API consumers and aims to facilitate the discovery and understanding of APIs, and the access to APIs and their producers. At the same time, the catalogue enables suppliers to easily publicise their APIs. </p><p>Administrations often consume several APIs (from different producers) to implement a teleservice or a new approach. The use of an interdepartmental tool allows them to ensure consistency in the authorisation procedure and centralise their requests.</p><p>To facilitate the lives of data providers, DINUM developed a specific tool to manage the authorisation phase, called &#x2018;DataPass&#x2019;. Furthermore, DINUM created two API hubs, namely <a href="https://entreprise.api.gouv.fr/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="api enterprise" resource="https://entreprise.api.gouv.fr/">API Enterprise</a> and <a href="https://api.gouv.fr/les-api/api-particulier" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="api particulier" resource="https://api.gouv.fr/les-api/api-particulier">API Particulier</a>.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">DataPass</p><p>DINUM worked on setting up a common legal framework to harmonise and streamline relations between data providers and service providers through the construction of DataPass, a tool facilitating the connection between suppliers and consumers. This tool is intended for stakeholders (e.g. public administrations) who wish to use personal data.

Public service providers just have to deal with a single account and a single contact to access multiple data to develop online public services.</p><p>For instance, the API hub helps administrations to simplify and improve administrative online processes such as scholarship applications. In this case, families&#x2019; incomes were directly retrieved from tax centres. In September 2018, the French administration received 650,000 successful calls, corresponding to as many supporting documents that did not need to be produced. This saves time for families: in the past, some parents had to take half a day off work to submit their applications, others to ask their children to queue during recess.<strong> </strong>Today, to replace a supporting document with a call to API Particulier users must still enter specific information to the administration, such as tax number or beneficiary number. The French administration would like users to be able to identify themselves more easily through <a href="https://franceconnect.gouv.fr/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="franceconnect" resource="https://franceconnect.gouv.fr/">FranceConnect</a>.<strong> </strong>Thus, with a single login and password, the API hub would allow everyone to simplify their procedures. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">FranceConnect</p><p>In 2016, France launched a digital identity federator called &#x2018;<a href="https://franceconnect.gouv.fr/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="france connect" resource="https://franceconnect.gouv.fr/"><em>France Connect</em></a>&#x2019; in order to simplify access to public and private services for French citizens. It relies on pre-existing accounts widely used by French citizens such as health insurance accounts, tax administration accounts, the digital identity proposed by the French postal service, etc. At this stage, 35 million people use it on a regular basis to connect to over 1&#xa0;500 online services, both public and private (mostly banking and insurance services for the private sector).

With this doctrine, cloud computing has become the default hosting and production mode for the State&apos;s digital services, for all new digital products and for products undergoing a substantial evolution. The State&#x2019;s digital services must now be hosted on one of the two internal interministerial public clouds or on cloud solutions provided by industrials satisfying strict security criteria. Indeed, the objective of this doctrine is to ensure the State&#x2019;s sovereignty, the continuity of the public services and data protection for citizens. A specific team was set up within DINUM to accompany administrations in making cloud computing a major tool for a quality digital transformation and to animate a community of public actors on this topic. This team works closely with the French Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) in order to ensure a secure environment for the use of cloud computing technology by the French State. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance Computing</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">GovTech</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-1044.png" alt="32-1044.png" class="keepElement"/></p><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p></div><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/publicservice/France" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on French bodies responsible for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-france">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2>National </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministry for Public Sector Transformation and the Civil Service</p><p>In France, the eGovernment strategy is under responsibility of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Public Sector Transformation and the Civil Service, who is in charge of public service transformation and State modernisation.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Interministerial Digital Directorate (DINUM)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/dinsic">Interministerial Digital Directorate (DINUM)</a>, which succeeded to the Interministerial Directorate for Digital Affairs and State Information and Communication System (DINSIC) in 2019, is a Prime Minister&#x2019;s service, placed under the authority of the Ministry for Public Sector Transformation and the Civil Service. </p><p>DINUM is in charge of directing, leading, supporting and coordinating public administrations&#x2019; actions aiming at enhancing the quality, efficiency and reliability of the services provided by the State&apos;s information and communication system.
