This strategy aimed to provide internet access with speed over 30 Mbps for all Greeks by 2020, and provide 50% of households with internet available at a speed exceeding 100 Mbps. The present National Broadband targets are in line with DAE 2020 and Gigabit Society 2025. So far, EUR 160 million of public funds have been utilised for broadband development in rural areas and EUR 300 million are going to be utilised in the framework of the UFBB project, in NGA-white areas throughout the country.</p><p>The <a href="http://nga.gov.gr/index.php/2019/02/27/rural-broadband/?lang=en">Rural Broadband project</a>, awarded in the framework of the 2017 European Broadband Awards provides broadband infrastructure coverage to almost 45% of Greek territory in specific rural areas, providing 95.96% of the population with a speed of minimum 30Mbps in the three geographical areas.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.sfbb.gr/">Superfast Broadband (SFBB)</a> project is a demand voucher scheme with a EUR 50 million budget that subsidises citizens to obtain a new broadband connection (or upgrade an existing one) to at least 100Mbps (readily upgradable to 1Gbps). </p><p>The <a href="http://nga.gov.gr/index.php/2019/02/27/ultrafast-broadband/?lang=en">Ultrafast Broadband project</a> directly contributes to the second strategic objectives of the NGA plan and has a EUR 700 million budget. It concerns an aid scheme that was approved on 31/7/2019 (SA.53135). The project will be implemented in areas that are mutually exclusive with regards to the SFBB and Rural Broadband (RB) projects. The newly deployed infrastructure will bring significant new capabilities to the market in terms of broadband service availability and capacity, speed, and the level of competition. In particular, the notified measure aims to ensure 100Mbps availability to most of the covered area, exceeding 98% of the active lines and 75% of the settlements, while ensuring gigabit upgradability.
