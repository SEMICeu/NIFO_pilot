Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>National Strategy for Digitalisation 2022&#x2013;2026</p><p>In May 2022, the Danish government launched a new <a href="https://en.digst.dk/media/27861/national-strategy-for-digitalisation-together-in-the-digital-development.pdf">National Strategy for Digitalisation</a>, which lays out the main lines for the digital development in Denmark in the years 2022&#x2013;2026. The strategy builds on the recommendations from the Danish government&#x2019;s &#x2018;Digitalisation Partnership&#x2019; and is the first of its kind in Denmark. It calls for broad and binding collaboration on digital development across both the public and the private sector, and contains nine visions identifying the next steps in Denmark&#x2019;s digital development. In describing these visions, the strategy presents 61 specific initiatives. The initiatives pursue many significant goals, among which maintaining Denmark&#x2019;s position as a digital front-runner and using digital solutions, new technology and data to strengthen Danish welfare, accelerate the green transition, increase growth and digital transformation of Danish small- and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), and strengthen cyber and information security. In doing so, the strategy also acknowledges the challenges that may accompany an increasingly digitised society. Therefore, a core element of the strategy is to make sure that citizens are able to use and benefit from the digital services regardless of differences in their digital skills. This also entails ensuring that technology and data are used ethically and with a clear focus on security, responsibility, transparency and trust.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Danish government signed the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government, thus re-affirming its commitment &#x2013; together with other EU Member States &#x2013; to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Public Administration and COVID-19</p><p>The public digital infrastructure has shown its worth during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it has enabled public services to uphold their high level even with a considerable degree of remote work within the State, regions and municipalities. Furthermore, the government has launched a range of new digital services to cope with COVID-19, including a contact-tracing app and the digital booking of tests and vaccines. </p><p>Thanks to digital-ready legislation and an advanced digital infrastructure, the central government was able to process <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/news/2020-11/Case Collection - Reducing administrative burdens with digital-ready legislation.pdf">COVID-19 stimulus checks</a> addressed to 2.2 million recipients in a fully automatic mode and in less than eight days. Furthermore, 2.1 million residents were able to digitally apply for and receive early holiday allowance for a total value of approximately EUR 14.5 billion. Finally, businesses were able to apply for the Danish stimulus packages for businesses during the pandemic <a href="https://virksomhedsguiden.dk/content/ydelser/kompensation-til-virksomheder-og-selvstaendige/be51dffe-da7b-4482-8a51-1568f8dc9966/">digitally</a> (i.e. for lost turnover), as the Danish <em>&#x2018;Virksomhedsguiden&#x2019;</em> incorporated a platform for applications and the provision of information before the final settling of accounts in the Danish Business Authority. As of 14 March 2022, the Danish Business Authority had helped 103&#xa0;054 businesses with stimulus packages for a total value of approximately EUR 7.1 billion. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digitalisation Partnership for Denmark&#x2019;s Future</p><p>In the spring of 2021, the Danish government launched a Digitalisation Partnership. The partnership involved top managers and experts from the Danish business community, the research community, civil society, stakeholders from the labour market, Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions. In October 2021, the partnership concluded its work and submitted <a href="https://en.digst.dk/media/24796/visions-and-recommendations-for-denmark-as-a-digital-pioneer-danish-government-digitisation-partnership.pdf">46 recommendations</a> on how Denmark can harness and utilise future technological opportunities. The recommendations offer suggestions for both the public and private sector as well as public&#x2011;private collaboration. </p><p>In May 2022, the Danish government presented a new <a href="https://en.digst.dk/media/27861/national-strategy-for-digitalisation-together-in-the-digital-development.pdf">National Strategy for Digitalisation</a> building upon the above-mentioned recommendations. The strategy lays out the main lines for digital development until 2030. </p><p>Before launching the strategy, as part of a new reform package and of the Finance Act of 2022, the government decided on a few digital initiatives that address some of the recommendations. These initiatives, among other things, aim to strengthen the digital transformation of SMEs, ease the administrative procedures for companies when reporting to authorities, make public data more accessible to businesses, researchers and citizens, and strengthen the use of new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector. Moreover, they focus on strengthening data ethics and digital-ready legislation.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategy for Denmark&#x2019;s Digital Growth</p><p>The <a href="http://www.blind.dk">Strategy for Denmark&#x2019;s Digital Growth</a> encompasses a series of goals and actions fostering the digital transformation of Danish commerce and industry. More specifically, the strategy consists of 38 initiatives, allocating a total of EUR 112 million from 2018 to 2025 to support the digital transformation of SMEs. Subsequently, the strategy foresees a EUR 10 million investment per year. Some of the key actions that the strategy includes are the following:  </p><ul><li>Digital enhancement of SMEs; </li><li>Digital hub for stronger digital growth;</li><li>Digital skills for all; </li><li>Data as driver of growth in trade and industry; </li><li>Agile regulation in the areas of trade and industry; and </li><li>Increased cybersecurity within companies.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Guidelines on How to Make Legislation Digital-Ready</p><p>A broad political agreement was reached in January 2018, requiring all legislation proposed after 1 July 2018 to comply with seven principles for <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/family/index_en.htm">digital-ready legislation</a>. The <a href="https://uk.rigsrevisionen.dk/">Guidelines on How to Make Legislation Digital-Ready</a> outline these principles and how to apply them in the legislative process. Additionally, all proposed legislation must be assessed for potential impacts regarding project risk, organisational changes, data protection and citizens&#x2019; rights. The findings must be described in the legislative proposal together with possible mitigating measures. To ensure that legislation is digital-ready, every legislative proposal is screened for compliance with the guidelines and consultation responses are sent to the responsible Ministries by a unit established within the Ministry of Finance. Since 2018, approximately 400 consultation responses have been sent. In support of this approach, a <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">course on digital-ready policymaking</a> is available to legislative drafters and policy officers in government departments.</p><p>A report documenting the initiative&#x2019;s results was <a href="https://en.digst.dk/news/news-archive/2021/may/review-new-legislation-enables-responsible-digitisation-to-an-increasing-degree/">published</a> in May 2021. The report concludes, among other things, that the effort is well under way and that new legislation is increasingly digital-ready. The report however also shows that existing legislation has not been systematically reviewed for digital-readiness. As part of the agreement on the Finance Act of 2022, it was decided to continue work on ensuring that legislation is digital-ready.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Sector Digitisation Strategies</p><p>The <a href="https://en.digst.dk/policy-and-strategy/digital-strategy/">Common Public Sector Digitisation Strategy 2016&#x2013;2020</a> (also known as &#x2018;Digital Strategy&#x2019;) was agreed between the Danish government, <a href="https://www.kl.dk/english/kl-local-government-denmark/">Local Government Denmark</a> and Danish Regions, and entered into force in May 2016. The goal of the strategy was to help shape the future of digital Denmark and ensure that the public sector was prepared to seize the advantages of technology. The strategy covered numerous themes related to the digitisation of the public sector, such as automation of administrative procedures, better user experience for citizens and businesses, digital welfare and data sharing.</p><p>In 2021, a set of initiatives was agreed between the Danish government, <a href="https://www.kl.dk/english/kl-local-government-denmark/">Local Government Denmark</a> and Danish Regions, with the purpose of extending and strengthening the main goals of the Digital Strategy throughout 2021 and 2022, until a new strategy was agreed upon. The previous Danish government formed the Danish Government Digitalisation Partnership, with members from the Danish business community, the research community, civil society, the social partners, Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions. In October 2021, the partnership handed over its recommendations for the public sector, the private sector and public-private collaboration on how to harness and utilise technological opportunities. A new National Strategy for Digitalisation covering both the public and private sectors was then published in May 2022. The strategy is the first of its kind in Denmark precisely in that it covers both sectors. </p><p>In conjunction with the new national strategy, a new binding Common Public Sector Digitisation Strategy for 2022&#x2013;2025, covering the public sector, was agreed between the Danish government, Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions. The strategy includes, among other things, initiatives aimed at using technology to reduce our climate footprint and ensure efficient adaptation to climate change, as well as to deal with labour shortage. </p><p><img src="../html/img/32-290.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The 13 initiatives forming the framework for a better management of ICT systems address issues such as the mandatory compliance to the central government&#x2019;s ICT system portfolio management model and the periodic review by the National ICT Council of each Ministry&#x2019;s ICT system management. The initiatives also address the development of cross-governmental network activities amongst leaders and employees working with digitalisation and developing the technical and professional competencies and skills required to manage ICT.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Common Framework for Public Sector Digital Architecture (Danish NIF)</p><p>In 2017, the central government, Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions agreed on a common<a href="https://arkitektur.digst.dk/sites/default/fileuploads/white_paper_on_a_common_public-sector_digital_architecture_pdfa.pdf"> Federal Digital Architecture</a> (<a href="https://arkitektur.digst.dk/en">FDA</a>) focusing on data sharing and cross-organisational processes. The FDA includes a general framework as well as a number of specific architecture assets. </p><p>The core is a set of general architecture principles and rules supported by guidelines on architecture description and communication, as well as rules for concept and data modelling. Activities such as skill development, architecture guidance and project review support the adoption of the common framework. The FDA then also includes a number of concrete architecture assets, like reference architectures on common issues such as the sharing of data and documents, user and rights management across domains, coherent user journeys in relation to digital self-services, and user&#x2011;centric and cross-cutting overview of data relevant to each citizen and enterprise (e.g. in relation to cases, payments, debt, appointments and deadlines). Finally, the FDA encompasses a number of common technical solutions such as the national infrastructure solutions for ID, Digital Signature, Single Sign On and Digital Post, among others. </p><p>The application of the general governance structure is voluntary depending on relevance, logic, and business case. Nonetheless, some elements, such as Digital Signature and Digital Post, are mandatory. Projects falling within the Common Public Sector Strategies shall take the FDA into account and undergo an architecture review. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Rules for Concept and Data Modelling</p><p>It is important that authorities and businesses are able to retrieve, understand and reuse data in the public sector. Therefore, the Common Public Sector Digital Architecture recommends applying the <a href="https://arkitektur.digst.dk/en/metoder/regler-begrebs-og-datamodellering">Rules for Concept and Data Modelling</a> to document concepts and data. The rules ensure that concepts and data are described and documented thoroughly, correctly and consistently, whilst reusing national and international models, standards and experiences to the extent possible. </p><h2>Key Enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Open data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Government Partnership Action Plan (2019&#x2013;2021)</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/members/denmark/">Open Government Partnership</a>, which is an international collaboration, the Danish government drafted the fourth <a href="https://twitter.com/Joinup_eu" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">National Action Plan (2019&#x2013;2021)</a><span resource="https://twitter.com/Joinup_eu" property="dct:title" content="National Action Plan (2019&#x2013;2021)"/> with seven initiatives from various parts of the Danish public sector aiming at strengthening trust and transparency in public authorities, especially in public sector digitalisation.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security Aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Strategy for Cyber and Information Security 2022&#x2013;2024</p><p>On 15 December 2021, the government launched a  to replace the previous strategy covering the period 2018&#x2011;2021.

The objective is to create a simpler and smoother access to health data, to enable advanced data analytics across data sources as well as to ensure high data security and transparency about the use of data. More specifically, the vision aims to ensure: i) easy and quick access to application and approval; ii) secure and flexible access to data on a common national analysis platform; iii) better and shared data services; and iv) high data security and transparency. The vision is implemented by establishing a single contact point for smooth access, approval and guidance to health data, and a common national analysis platform offering a secure analytical environment, and allowing for linking data sources and conducting complex analyses.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategy for Denmark&#x2019;s Tech Diplomacy 2021-2023</p><p>In February 2021, the Danish government launched the <a href="https://techamb.um.dk/-/media/country-sites/techamb-en/media/strategy-for-denmarks-tech-diplomacy-2021-2023.ashx">Strategy for Denmark&#x2019;s Tech Diplomacy 2021&#x2013;2023</a>. It consists of three pillars that are central to future technological development and governance: (i) responsibility is key &#x2013; the tech industry shall meet its societal responsibility and operate on a level playing field; (ii) democracy should be the premise of governance, also in a digital world &#x2013; global digital governance shall build on democratic values and human rights; and (iii) security is central &#x2013; technology shall support Denmark&#x2019;s safety and security.</p><p>In addition, Denmark has led the &#x2018;Tech for Democracy&#x2019; flagship initiative, a multi-stakeholder push for protecting and promoting human rights and democratic values in an era of rapid technological development. The initiative has produced the Copenhagen Pledge on Tech for Democracy, with more than 200 signatories from governments, industry and civil society. It has gathered twelve action coalitions working on concrete solutions to issues of the digital age. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">White Paper: Towards a Better Social Contract with Tech Giants </p><p>In June 2021, the former Danish government published a <a href="https://techamb.um.dk/-/media/country-sites/techamb-en/media/white-paper-engelsk-version-.ashx">White Paper</a> with a proposal for debate and nine principles for a more responsible and fair society with regard to major tech companies. The White Paper aims to initiate a public debate as well as to formulate and implement Danish initiatives to address the business models of major tech companies and the platform economy to ensure that digitalisation provides the most fertile ground for Danish democracy, economy and culture. </p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><p>As mentioned in Section 2.1, the Digitalisation Partnership for Denmark&#x2019;s Future contained recommendations related to emerging technologies. These recommendations laid the foundation for a number of initiatives under the National Strategy for Digitalisation.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence</p><p>In 2019, Denmark established an investment fund (2019&#x2013;2022) to support the testing of AI in the public sector. The fund currently supports 40 signature projects to test AI within the healthcare, climate, and social and employment areas. In addition, the Finance Act of 2022 included a fund of EUR 19.2 million for the period 2022&#x2013;2025 to accelerate the use of emerging technologies, such as AI, in the public sector. </p><p>On a strategic level, Denmark&#x2019;s efforts relating to emerging technologies such as AI are based one two national strategies: the National Strategy for Digitalisation (2022) and the Joint Public Digitalisation Strategy (2022&#x2013;2025). Several initiatives under these two strategies support the experimentation, use and upscaling of emerging technologies such as AI.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p><img src="../html/img/32-305.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The strategy draws attention to the importance of a well-developed digital infrastructure including high-performance computing (HPC). It sets out a vision that researchers at Danish universities must have access to digital infrastructure including HPC, enabling world-class research and education. Regarding HPC in particular, the strategy lays out five targets for national cooperation: i) establishing a new common model for open access to national HPC facilities; ii) ensuring the operation and upgrade of existing national HPC resources; iii) providing increased HPC resources; iv) strengthening and coordinating HPC competences in Denmark; and v) continuing to strengthening Danish membership of the EuroHPC collaboration.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">GovTech</h3><p>GovTech Programme Denmark 2019&#x2013;2020</p><p>The Danish Business Authority and the Agency for Digital Government established the (pilot) GovTech Programme Denmark in 2019 to strengthen public sector innovation and develop GovTech as a Danish position of strength. The aim of the programme was to increase cooperation between the public sector and tech companies, and thereby the application by the public sector of innovative technologies. More specifically, the programme sought to match selected challenges from the public sector with solutions or ideas from innovative tech companies, and actively supported this matchmaking process by facilitating market dialogue and offering guidance on procurement rules. The programme also focused, among other things, on the typical barriers experienced by SMEs participating in public-private innovation. </p><p>The GovTech Programme was ended in 2020 after completing two rounds of matchmaking and the lessons learned fed into the development of the new National Centre for Public-Private Sector Innovation (CO-PI) which was established in 2022.</p><p>	</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-333.png" alt="32-333.png" class="keepElement"/></p></div><p>3</p><p>Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/legalframework/Denmark" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2>Specific Legislation on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Standing Committee for the Legal Framework on eGovernment</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://en.digst.dk/policy-and-strategy/digital-strategy/">Digital Strategy 2016-2020</a>, presented by the former government, a Standing Committee was set up to create a clear legal framework for eGovernment.

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>Legal Framework for Collaboration on the National Digital Research Infrastructure </p><p>No legislation is specifically targeted at public administration in this field. However, a legal framework was established for collaboration on the national digital research infrastructure, including in the field of high-performance computing. Collaboration with and between Danish universities is called Danish eInfrastructure Cooperation (DeiC). The legal basis of DeiC was recently established by a new text annotation to the Finance Act of 2023, as well as by an executive order, which came into force on 1 January 2023. The most significant changes as a result of the new legal framework are that DeiC&#x2019;s Board gets more autonomy, with a clearer division of responsibilities between the Ministry of Higher Education and Science, and DeiC&#x2019;s Board. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">GovTech</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-383.png" alt="32-383.png" class="keepElement"/></p><p>4</p><p>Digital Public Administration Infrastructure </p></div><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/structure/Denmark" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Infrastructure </h1><h2>Platforms and Applications</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">National Platforms and Applications</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Borger.dk - Citizen Portal</p><p>First launched in January 2007, the <a href="https://borger.dk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="citizen portal" resource="https://borger.dk/">Citizen Portal</a> is a single point of entry for citizens to online information and eServices published by the public sector, regardless of the public authority.

The portal is managed by the Agency for Digital Government in collaboration with various other authorities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Automated Business Reporting</p><p>According to estimates, increased automation of companies&#x2019; bookkeeping practices and financial reporting entails yearly efficiency savings of EUR 400 million in Denmark. By introducing digital and automated bookkeeping processes, demanding manual processes and administrative burdens are minimised and companies&#x2019; resources can be used to deal with the companies&#x2019; core tasks. Furthermore, automated business reporting allows for digitalised and automated interactions with the authorities and, as a result, to report accounting information easily and in real time. </p><p>The Danish government therefore plans to introduce regulation that will require the vast majority of Danish companies to use digital accounting systems, to the benefit of individual companies, authorities and the general economy. With regard to the latter, automated business reporting will have a clear positive impact, as the projected GDP effects are estimated to be at least EUR 255 million.</p><p>Automated business reporting also provides clear benefits for the authorities, both through potential efficiency savings, and through a more targeted auditing and financial monitoring. In this regard, increased automation and digitalisation in the companies allow for a more efficient monitoring by the authorities. When financial records are kept in digital accounting systems, any changes in the records are logged and disclosed to the authorities. Based on this information, authorities can target monitoring operations and minimise the number of audits made on law&#x2011;abiding companies. Consequently, authorities are able to combat economic crime and tax fraud more efficiently.  </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Climate Compass</p><p>To give businesses a user-friendly, transparent and uniform tool to calculate their carbon footprint and gain an overview of how their climate impact is spread across activities over time, the Danish Business Authority and the Danish Energy Agency have introduced the Climate Compass, which targets SMEs. </p><p>The Compass allows businesses to: (i) calculate direct carbon emissions of company activities (i.e. own transportation, and oil and gas consumption); (ii) calculate the indirect carbon emissions from their energy providers, subcontractors and customers; and (iii) estimate the climate impact of various carbon-reducing initiatives in the company. Currently, further functionalities of the Climate Compass are being developed.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-395.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The portal aims to provide descriptions of and links to valuable public sector data, and help users navigate the data landscape. </p><p>Denmark has a long history of using high quality data for public administration purposes, including geospatial data, population statistics, and data on the flora and fauna of Denmark. In recent years, public sector organisations have increasingly made this data available to a wider range of users, much of it as open data. </p><p>In this context, the new National Data Portal is part of a wider European effort to leverage data to solve societal challenges, and spur innovation and economic growth. The portal uses the DCAT&#x2011;AP-DK standard for metadata, which is based on European and international standards and has been adopted as part of the common IT architecture for the Danish public sector. The portal will continuously develop based on user demand, with an in-house team of developers implementing changes using agile methodologies.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Subnational Platforms and Applications</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions</p><p>One of the overall objectives of digitalisation in Denmark is to associate the relevant levels of government. Thus, Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions are also involved in several of the nationally operated portals, e.g. borger.dk and sikkerdigital.dk.</p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Broadband Speed	</p><p>Denmark has a good high-speed broadband coverage, also in rural areas. The broadband target set at political level, i.e. that all households and businesses shall have access to 100/30 Mbps, was confirmed in 2021, and a new target was agreed stating that 98% of households and businesses shall have access to infrastructure capable of delivering gigabit speed by 2025. In 2022, 96% of all households and businesses were covered with at minimum 100/30 Mbps and 91% were covered with gigabit speed. An ambitious commercial roll-out of high-speed fixed broadband is expected. Consequently, a recent forecast estimated that 99% of all households and businesses will be covered with fixed high-speed broadband in the mid-2020s. Furthermore, 98% of Denmark is estimated to be covered with 5G by one or more mobile operators. </p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Data Distributor</p><p>The <a href="https://eng.sdfi.dk/data/datadistribution/the-data-distribution-platform" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="data distributor" resource="https://eng.sdfi.dk/data/datadistribution/the-data-distribution-platform">Data Distributor</a> is the main channel for accessing basic data from several authorities. It replaces a series of public distribution solutions, and ensures that authorities and companies are provided with easy and safe access to basic data in one collective system, rather than resorting to many different systems and interfaces. By now, the Data Distributor samples a unique variety of basic data, e.g<em>.</em> civil registration numbers, registered data on land, properties, parcels and buildings, registered data on companies, registered data on addresses, administrative divisions and place names, geographical base maps, geodata, etc. More data will be constantly made available on the Data Distributor.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Reference Architecture for Sharing Data and Documents</p><p>Denmark has published a reference architecture to facilitate the sharing of data and documents electronically. The reference architecture revolves around describing the disclosure of data by transmission. Disclosure by transmission focuses on the actual action of passing on data, whereas the interpretation of the sharing of data is broader and includes making data available for potential reuse, even if data may never be accessed. One of the main purposes of this reference architecture is to guide and assist in the choice between two fundamental business patterns for the disclosure of data by transmission:</p><ul><li>Transmission on request: typically, system-to-system integrations using an application programming interface (API); and</li><li>Transmission by message: typically, the legally binding communication of data (possibly in the form of documents) from public authorities to citizens and businesses, but also a classical pattern in system-to-system integrations.</li></ul><p>The fundamental difference between these two scenarios is whether it is the actor transmitting data or the actor receiving data who is responsible for the concrete data process flow.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">New Application Profiles</p><p>A Danish application profile based on version 2.0 of the <a href="https://eng.em.dk/media/13081/305755-gb-version_4k.pdf" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="dcat application profile" resource="https://eng.em.dk/media/13081/305755-gb-version_4k.pdf">DCAT Application Profile</a> for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP) has been completed and approved for use in the context of the Danish public sector (DCAT-AP-DK). </p><p>Furthermore, to support higher reuse and quality of metadata about IT systems, two application profiles have been established: a Basic Application Profile describing the core properties of public sector IT systems and an Archive Application Profile extending the basic profile elements relevant to the submission of information about IT systems to the National Archives.</p><p>In addition, a method for describing dataset quality has been established. The method has been developed on the basis of international standards such as the W3C Data on the Web Best Practices, including the Data Quality Vocabulary, and ISO 25012 on Data Quality.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-407.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Existing NemID users will either be migrated to MitID or be registered for MitID in July 2023. In addition, more than 5 million users aged 13 or more are already using the MitID solution. Like NemID, MitID is used to access both public and private service providers.</p><p>MitID is an identification and authentication service only; signing can be achieved using a remote signing capability built in the national Danish trust services component and with MitID as the means of authentication.</p><p>The MitID business solution, called MitID Erhverv, was launched in the second half of 2022, and enables businesses and their employees to access digital self-service solutions with MitID on behalf of the business entity. MitID Erhverv thus will be the main channel for companies when using&#xa0; digital self-service solutions (e.g. Virk and Digital Post) on behalf of the business entity, which makes reporting to the public sector easier.</p><p>The MitID solution has been developed in a well-established partnership between the Danish public sector and Finance Denmark, the Danish Business Association for Banks and other financial institutions.

The eID-Gateway consists of the Danish eIDAS Connector and the Danish eIDAS Proxy Service. The latter went live on 25 November 2021. The eID-Gateway utilises the existing national SAML protocol, which is also implemented in the national broker for public services, NemLog-in (see below).</p><p>Currently, a handful of eServices are connected to the Danish eIDAS Connector. Work is ongoing with regard to the implementation of the Single Digital Gateway Regulation, as well as to the integration of more national eServices into the Danish eIDAS infrastructure. Furthermore, Denmark is one of the few Member States that provides a solution for identity matching, a functionality in the eIDAS Connector which went into pilot phase on 18 January 2022. The solution is envisioned to become semi-automated by the fourth quarter of 2023 to be able to scale up the identity matching process of European citizens.</p><p>In October 2022, Denmark completed the process of notifying the new Danish eID, MitID, in accordance with Article 9 of the eIDAS Regulation, with publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU).
