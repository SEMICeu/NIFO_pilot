The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p>The strategy followed up on the priorities of the EU Digital Single Market. At the national level, it accelerated ongoing processes in terms of building the digital market and carrying out various measures that arose from the most recent cross-sectoral policies of the EU. The strategy also reflected the strategic materials and recommendations of international organisations (EU, OECD, UN, G7 and G20) that consider digital transformation to be the key to inclusive and sustainable growth. The strategy puts emphasis on new digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, 5G technology, big data and analytical processing of data, blockchain or high-performance computers, which will eventually become a new engine of economic growth and competitiveness.</p><p>Several areas were identified regarding the necessity to multiply the potential of digital transformation: </p><ul><li>Economy;</li><li>Society and education;</li><li>Public services;</li><li>Rural development; and</li><li>Science, research and innovation.</li></ul><p>The targets of the process are the citizens, whose everyday life should get simpler, and entrepreneurs, whose businesses should be supported by various incentives and whose bureaucratic burdens should be eliminated.</p><ul><li>Improvement of education and fostering digital skills and employment for the modern era; </li><li>Creation of a basis for a modern digital economy; </li><li>Improvement of the ability of public services to innovate and use data; and</li><li>Development and practical implementation of artificial intelligence.</li></ul><p>As for the digital government, the ambition is to launch and implement a &#x201c;data-driven State&#x201d; concept in the public administration.

Transforming the functioning of public administration organisations and processes is also key, so that such analyses can be effectively used. The action plan also proposes the continuous deployment of fully automated public administration services.
