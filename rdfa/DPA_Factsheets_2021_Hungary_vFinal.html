Prepared by the Ministry of Innovation and Technology and the Ministry of the Interior, the strategy takes into account the previous National Infocommunication Strategy 2014-2020 (NIS) and the Digital Success Program 2.0 (DJP).</p><p>Aiming to develop the economy, education, innovation and research and public administration, the strategy is based on four pillars and the following focus areas:</p><ul><li>Digital infrastructure: development of gigabit-capable networks and 5G, expansion of the digital infrastructures for schools and higher education institutions, continued development of the National Telecommunication Backbone Network, expansion of supercomputing capacity for SMEs; research networks and public institutions;</li><li>Digital skills: create programs for digital competency, increase the number and capacity of IT professionals, support the learning of digital skills in education;</li><li>Digital economy: increase the digital reach and use of SMEs, develop digital start-up businesses, create support programs for the ICT industry and its development and utilise data assets of the government for economic purposes; and</li><li>Digital State: digital development of both central and local and cross-border public administration with user-friendly systems and customer-centric services, development of smart-towns and smart areas, increase of electronic services.</li></ul><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Digitalisation Strategy 2021-2030</p><p>The draft of the <a href="https://2015-2019.kormany.hu/download/f/58/d1000/NDS.pdf">National Digitalisation Strategy 2021-2030</a> presents increased interoperability as one of the requirements for the fourth pillar on the development of a digital State. More specifically, it lists the need to establish a data-based administration in the country, with interoperable data connections between administrative services on different levels (local, national and European) and aspects (legal, organisational, semantic and technical). </p><p>Apart from technology neutrality and IT security requirements, a development based on software with open-source codes needs to be encouraged.

Pursuant to the eAdministration Act, from 1&#xa0;January 2018 the cooperating bodies involved in administrative processes shall obtain information (data or documents) from another cooperating body rather than asking the customer (citizen or business) to resubmit it. Information must be obtained by automated data exchange processes, where possible, or otherwise by a simple secure information exchange.

The 2013 amendment of the PSI Directive was implemented by the deadline of 2015 (Act No. XCVI of 2015). The Hungarian implementation went beyond the provisions of the PSI Directive in some points. Specifically, the new <a href="https://ai-hungary.com/api/v1/companies/15/files/137203/view">Strategy on Artificial Intelligence 2020-2030</a> was adopted and it includes a dedicated part on data policy and data re-use, calling for a proper institutional background and a one-way-access data portal. Within the framework of the Strategy, the establishment of a new national open data portal has been started and the Hungarian Data Asset Agency (<em>Nemzeti Adatvagyon &#xdc;gyn&#xf6;ks&#xe9;g</em> &#x2013; NAV&#xdc;) has been established with the main purpose to facilitate and coordinate the re-use of public sector data among public sector bodies.

According to current plans, eIDAS authentication will also be available within the Central Authentication Agent. The Hungarian eIDAS node is under development. The preparations for the Hungarian electronic identification (the eID card) and the development of the proxy service are also in progress. More in detail, in January 2021 the number of valid eID cards issued since the launch in January 2016 reached 5.4 million and the number of Client Gate accounts surpassed 4.5 million in January 2021.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Government Projects and Cybersecurity</p><p>The National Cyber Defence Institute of the Special Service for National Security must assess the conformity of each public administration IT and eGovernment service development project with the rules of the Act L of 2013.

In July 2020, the amount of output VAT was reduced to HUF 0, with all invoices issued between domestic taxpayers being exchanged through the available system. In January 2021, the obligation of sending invoice data was extended to all kinds of invoices issued by domestic taxpayers, but taxpayers have an additional 3 months to prepare themselves for fulfilling the obligation without any sanction. For this purpose, the National Tax and Customs Administration (NTCA) developed and launched a central <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/home" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="online invoice system" resource="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/home">Online Invoice System</a> connected to the financial management software or the ERP system of businesses via machine-to-machine interface.

The NTCA also provides an online invoicing solution free of charge, mainly for SMEs, that can be used to issue eInvoices as well as paper invoices, and automatically sends the invoice data to the NTCA, regardless of the amount of the output VAT. To promote and encourage eInvoicing and digital administration, in May 2020 this free online invoicing programme was made available through a mobile app, also helping to reduce administrative steps. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing in Public Procurement</p><p>To comply with Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement, since 18&#xa0;April 2019 the Public Procurement Act has been requiring contracting authorities to receive and process invoices which comply with the relevant European standard.
