The strategy has a solid governance and KPI metrics to safeguard proper execution; 2021 is acknowledged as a pivotal year for enhanced digital fitness of the society, the entrepreneurial landscape and eGovernment transformation. The National Strategy for Digital Transformation includes the following pillars: </p><ul><li>Promote eGovernment by redesigning the Ministry&#x2019;s enterprise architecture and governance model, optimizing our service delivery model, delivering a resilient, robust and secure ICT infrastructure; </li><li>Deliver a stronger digital economy and increasingly more digital and competitive industries;</li><li>Come up with a <a href="https://dec.dmrid.gov.cy/dmrid/dec/ws_dec.nsf/842BF8FCEECB2EE4C2258573002B58A9/&#x24;file/Broadband Plan 2021-2025_EN.pdf">National Broadband Plan</a> to facilitate high speed network connectivity and increase take-up;</li><li>Promote an accessible and inclusive society that has the skills and the motivation to embrace the national digital transformation and actively participate in digital communities; and</li><li>Ensure <a href="https://dsa.cy/strategy/csrc-2020">Security</a> in data and infrastructure and increase the trust of the public to the online transactions.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Public Services</p><p>The Cypriot government has built a new delivery model for the development of end-to-end quality digital services, i.e. the Digital Services Factory (DSF) model, aiming to improve the quality of life for citizens and businesses by providing 100% of public services online. The provision of digital services to the public, in a user-friendly, efficient and effective way, will ultimately facilitate the interaction with public services, without the need for physical presence. The DSF will develop advanced digital services following an Agile/Scrum methodology, through redesigning and reengineering of procedures, and following a citizen journey that provides adaptability, response to change and is based on user experience. </p><p>In this context, a <a href="https://www.dmrid.gov.cy/dmrid/research.nsf/All/72B447F6352243DCC225863000314A52?OpenDocument">framework agreement</a> with the Government Digital Service (GDS) of the United Kingdom (UK) has been signed for the establishment of this new delivery model based on the UK example gov.uk. </p><p>Within the scope of the project, a DSF Multidisciplinary Team has been established in the DMRID. It works closely with GDS, aiming to deliver all the required prerequisites that would allow for the efficient provision of high-quality and user-friendly digital services to the public.</p><p>The plan is to achieve the provision of all public services online according to the standards and methodologies of the DSF.

The total budget for the Plan, which is included in the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP) amounts to over EUR 24 million for the period 2021&#x2013;2026.</p><p>The purpose of the plan is to strengthen the digital fitness and capacity of citizens across the whole spectrum of demographics, social structure and economic activity. Digital skills are an essential prerequisite for learning, working and actively participating in a sustainable and competitive economy and in an open and inclusive society. Emphasis is given on actions related to meeting the growing needs of the labour market &#x2013; both in regard to broad-based digital skills and ICT specialists &#x2013; but also on redesigning the education system to better use digital tools in teaching and learning processes, cultivate the skills of the future and promote the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) career path.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Equity Fund</p><p>Furthermore, the President of the Republic plans to sign an amended Memorandum of Understanding with the Estonian Prime Minister, during his visit in April 2022, where new areas of collaboration in the eGovernment sector will be defined. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Administration Reform (PAR)</p><p>The <a href="http://www.reform.gov.cy/en/">Public Administration Reform (PAR)</a> is considered a very important structural change aiming to create flexible, modern and productive public services for the benefit of both citizens and businesses. The PAR aims to solve horizontal and sectoral issues. In relation to the horizontal/cross-cutting issues, the reform of human resource management (HRM) across the public sector is planned. </p><p>More specifically, the government drafted and submitted to the House of Representatives legislative proposals which were approved in January 2022. The new legislation introduces in the public service a new system of appraisal and selection of candidates for filling the promotion posts in the public service from the year 2024 onwards, with different criteria and weights for each category of posts. The legislative changes aim to ensure the selection of the most suitable candidates and the most efficient implementation of the principles of objectivity and merit. It also introduces a new performance appraisal system for the performance appraisal of the employees based on specific criteria and a detailed framework of competencies/skills, according to their hierarchical level, starting from the annual evaluation for the year 2023. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Action Plan on Better Regulation</p><p>The third and final progress report for the Action Plan on Better Regulation that covered the period from 2015 to 2018 was submitted to the Ministerial Council in late 2019.

The plan consists of three priority axes:</p><ul><li>Simplification of procedures and legislation and reduction of the administrative burden;</li><li>Better law-making and impact assessment (IA) of new legislation; and </li><li>Embedding the culture and enhancing relevant skills in relation to the Action Plan on Better Regulation.</li></ul><p>The IA mechanism, put in place in 2017 to undertake more focused and thorough IAs for new legislation, was embedded and is now a mandatory part of the legal drafting procedure. An IA report summarising the main findings and suggestions for the way forward was published in 2018. Its intention was to continue the training programme of government officials and further enhance the implementation of the new IA framework.</p><p>Further to the above three axes, the action plan also included actions that are being promoted under the pillar of eGovernment, which go hand in hand with the other Better Regulation initiatives.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Operational Programme &#x2018;Competitiveness and Sustainable Development&#x2019; </p><p>The promotion of ICT use is one of the seven priority axes of the 2014&#x2013;2020 OP &#x2018;<a href="http://www.dgepcd.gov.cy/dgepcd/dgepcd.nsf/page09_en/page09_en?OpenDocument">Competitiveness and Sustainable Development&#x2019;</a>. The budget of the axis is around EUR 40 million (6% of the OP&#x2019;s total budget), which is co-financed by the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF) with EUR 33.5 million. Around 85% of this budget was allocated to strengthening ICT applications for eGovernment, eLearning and eHealth. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Recovery and Resilience Facility</p><p>The <a href="http://www.cyprus-tomorrow.gov.cy">Recovery and Resilience Facility</a> (thereafter called the Facility) is the centrepiece of &#x2018;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/recovery-plan-europe/pillars-next-generation-eu_en">Next Generation EU</a>&#x2019;, a temporary recovery instrument that allows the Commission to raise funds to help repair the immediate economic and social damage brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.

The Facility will provide EUR 672.5 billion in loans and grants available to support reforms and investments undertaken by the Member States.</p><p>The proposed projects fall under the following policy domains and specific strategic portfolios, which are perfectly aligned with the 2020-2025 Digital Strategy:</p><p>1. Upgrade Infrastructure for Connectivity (EUR 53 million) - the Digital infrastructure Portfolio:</p><p>Ensuring 5G and fibre coverage for 100% of the population living in organised communities, including deployment of 5G along the main terrestrial corridors, and enabling universal and affordable access to Gigabit connectivity in all urban and rural areas, in line with the EU 2025 Gigabit connectivity objectives.</p><p>2. Promote eGovernment (EUR 46 million) - the Digital Government Portfolio:</p><p>eGovernment projects are developed through a 2-tier approach, more specifically through the rapid deployment of small-scale digital solutions (microservices) and the parallel long-term implementation of mega eGovernment projects. There is a holistic approach encompassing all governmental authorities. </p><p>3. Smart Cities (EUR 35 million) - the Digital infrastructure Portfolio:</p><p>The DMRID has been appointed to take the leading and coordinating role in developing a nation-wide strategy on Smart Cities, orchestrating, through a well-crafted plan, the Smart-cities framework, as well as all supporting initiatives and smart-cities building blocks. </p><p>4. Digital Skills (EUR 1.85 million) &#x2013; the Digital Society Portfolio:</p><p>This initiative has been specifically designed and formulated for the enhancement of digital skills across all population groups (public administration, enterprises and society at large) as well as the promotion of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and professional paths, so as to effectively address the market shortage in ICT professionals.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Scheme</p><p>The government has introduced the national eID scheme according to the eIDAS, aiming to the High Assurance Level.

Thus, eOASIS serves as a records management system.</p><p>The deployment of eOASIS will be done in two phases. Phase I is currently in progress; the needs of around 1&#xa0;300 users have been covered by using the current infrastructure. Phase I is expected to be completed within 2022 and will cater to the needs of 15 more governmental organisations. Phase II concerns approximately 7&#xa0;000 users and will cover the remaining needs of the public sector. Currently, a study is underway aiming to define the best possible technical solution for the rollout.
