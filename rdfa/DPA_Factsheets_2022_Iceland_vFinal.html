Cloud solutions are already in use by many public bodies, making it urgent to co-ordinate these projects for efficiency and increased security purposes.</p><p> </p><p>The emphasis on digital services and user-centric service design has increased the demand on institutions for speed and efficient service. Cloud solutions that shorten the delivery time of infrastructure and IT services contribute to the quick, effective and secure provision of digital services.</p><p> </p><p>Cloud service also opens new opportunities, e.g., in the field of artificial intelligence, and for deeper data analysis, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to exploit. A Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) was introduced by the Central Public Procurement Agency in the first quarter of 2022 to support purchasing of cloud services.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Data Security Classification</p><p>Data Security Classification is a prerequisite for more secure storage, handling and mediation of public sector data. It is also an important step in harmonising and amplifying more effective use and exchange of data between public bodies, the private sector and citizens. The classification is currently in the consultation process and will be published in 2022.

The strategy pursues two goals:</p><ul><li>Excellent skills and deployment of cyber security technology: knowledge and skills will be strengthened by increasing public education, training, research, development, and international cooperation. Using the best available technology and solutions will improve the ability to prevent, respond and minimise the damage of cyberattacks. </li><li>Safe online environment: strong online law enforcement and a legal environment in line with international standards will provide a basis to respond to unacceptable behaviour online. Emphasis will be placed on protection for children online. Security planning, risk analysis and resilience of critical infrastructure will be strengthened and the ability to respond to security threats and defence increased.   </li></ul><p>The strategy will be accompanied by an action plan, which will be released during the first half of 2022. The Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Innovation is responsible, working with relevant ministries and other stakeholders, for identifying specific initiatives to achieve the strategy objectives. The same ministry will also be responsible for monitoring and reporting on the overall progress of implementing the actions of the action plan.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Action Plan </p><ul><li>The government is committed to making Iceland one of the leading nations in the world in the field of digital services. The goal is to simplify public governance, improve (digital) public services, increase transparency and access to information through the use of digital solutions. </li><li>Co-ordinated efforts will be continued on improving the processing, storage, mediation, use and re-use of public data, as well as promoting easier access to data. </li><li>Emphasis will be placed on Digital Iceland&#x2019;s core digital products, available to public entities and via the government portal Island.is to citizens and the private sector.</li><li>The government intends to use innovation increasingly to solve public sector challenges. Premises will be created to enable public bodies to work with start-ups in designing and developing solutions that can solve the sector&#x2019;s challenges better and more cost-effectively. </li></ul><p>The government&#x2019;s medium-term fiscal plan for 2022-2027 describes individual actions in more detail. These actions are intertwined with the strategies and policies already mentioned in this chapter.</p><p>A revamped portal for public services, Island.is, was launched in 2020, to provide a central point of access to all digital public services.</p><p>The number of visits to the site has increased steadily since then, and by December 2021 the number of visits corresponded to 65% of the population visiting it every month.

It is currently used by 34 legal entities, with information input from 10 parties. The system will promote the automation of services by facilitating the automation process.</p><p><strong>Island.is</strong> <strong>login service</strong> offers secure access to self-service digital solutions of public entities. A new login service was launched in 2021.&#xa0;It includes a system enabling authorised agents to log in on behalf of companies, as well as individuals acting on behalf of family members or representatives of persons with disabilities. The agency system ensures the traceability of the person who logs in on behalf of another and thus ensures the security of the client granting the agent authorisation.</p><p><strong>Island.is mailbox</strong> is a communication solution that enables public authorities to send material securely to individuals and legal entities. The Act on a Digital Mailbox sets out the government&apos;s goal of enabling individuals and companies to access all principal public sector data through the mailbox by 2025. At year-end 2021, 32 public entities were using a digital mailbox to share data, and in 2021 around 8 million documents were made available.</p><p><strong>Island.is application system </strong>is a tool available to public entities to build user-friendly digital applications for the public service they provide. The application system enables institutions to use digital technology to reduce costs while greatly improving services for users. </p><p><strong>Island.is</strong> <strong>institutional pages </strong>give public entities the opportunity to move their websites under the technical framework of Island.is with the associated gains in efficacy and cost-efficiency. This arrangement encourages public entities to focus on their core tasks and services to the public by utilising the technical framework, design system and content policy of Island.is for their websites.</p><p><strong>Island.is My pages</strong> was redesigned in 2021 with users&apos; needs and accessibility issues in mind. The solution provides public entities with the possibility to link the data currently provided on their My pages to Island.is, which can reduce the number of similar public sector pages. This increases cost-efficiency and gives users access to more data at fewer locations, improving user experience.</p><h2>Key Enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Laws on the re-use of public sector information</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">NOBID</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic identification</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">X-Road</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Procurement &#x2013; Policy and Action Plan</p><p>The new <a href="https://www.stjornarradid.is/efst-a-baugi/frettir/stok-frett/2021/04/15/Ny-innkaupastefna-Framsaekin-og-sjalfbaer-innkaup-laekka-kostnad-um-3-5-milljarda-a-ari/">policy on sustainable public procurement</a> was published in April 2021.

The amendment removed general obstacles to the development of electronic administration. In drafting the amendment, the responsible committee was guided by the concept of equivalent value, and also emphasised the need to maintain technical neutrality. The changes included permission &#x2013; but no obligation - for the electronic handling of governmental administration cases.</p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Key Enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Use and Reuse of Public Sector Information</p><p>Conditions for the reuse of public sector information are partly covered by the <a href="http://www.althingi.is/lagas/141b/2012140.html" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Information Act</a><span resource="http://www.althingi.is/lagas/141b/2012140.html" property="eli:title" content="Information Act"/>.
