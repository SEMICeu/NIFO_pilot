Its two core objectives are: first, the publication of high-value government data in open format, making it publicly available and freely reusable; and second, engaging with a broad community of stakeholders to promote its social and economic benefits. The strategy sets out seven strategic themes which will guide the Open Data Initiative over the lifetime of the strategy:</p><ul><li>Broaden the range of public bodies actively engaged in the Open Data Initiative &#x2013; the &#x2018;Open Data Providers&#x2019;;</li><li>Broaden the scope and improve the quality, quantity and range of open data and associated metadata (to be used internally and made available to the public), and improve the quality and range of services provided through the national Open Data Portal;</li><li>Continue to engage with all stakeholders and encourage the use of open data;</li><li>Support and encourage various groups of open data users;</li><li>Provide a framework to support and train all data providers and build capacity in the management and use of open data;</li><li>Evaluate the impact, benefits and risks of the Open Data Initiative and benchmark against other jurisdictions; and</li><li>Ensure that effective governance structures are in place to implement the strategy.</li></ul><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform issued <a href="https://assets.gov.ie/212217/bd5cd126-1954-4d65-8b3d-dd5a8398b453.pdf">Circular 20/2021</a>, which sets out public service organisations&#x2019; obligations to comply with the <a href="https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/376/made/en/print" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Open Data Directive</a><span resource="https://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2021/si/376/made/en/print" property="dct:title" content="Open Data Directive"/>.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Government Partnership National Action Plan </p><p>An <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/members/ireland/">online portal</a> was deployed to reach a wide audience, encourage discussion, and inspire a sense of community.

The act comes in the wake of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018, with the aim to clarify and strengthen the data-sharing rights and obligations of public bodies. The act paves the way for more efficient and cost-effective service delivery by public bodies by providing a clear legal basis for the sharing of personal data in certain circumstances. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden associated with the need for individuals to provide their personal data to numerous public bodies. The act allows for the sharing of personal data between public bodies where the sharing is for the performance of a function of either of the public bodies. In addition, the act provides for the establishment of a Personal Data Access Portal that would allow individuals to view their personal data as well as information in relation to any data breaches affecting their personal data and the data-sharing agreements under which their personal data is processed. Besides, the act allows the Minister to designate base registries for use by public bodies so that they can access personal data without having to collect it directly from service users. A base registry will have an owner who must ensure the personal data is accurate and up to date.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Guidance on the Data Sharing Governance Framework under the DSGA 2019</p><p>Public Service Bodies wishing to leverage the DSGA 2019 as their legal basis for sharing data can refer to this <a href="https://prod-g2g-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/Guidance_on_the_Data_Sharing_Governance_Framework_under_the_DSGA.pdf">Guidance</a> to find clarification on what constitutes data sharing, when data can and can&#x2019;t be shared, who can share data, and see a summary of how to share data and the processes involved with the new Data Sharing Governance Framework.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">The <a href="https://prod-g2g-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/DSGA_Data_Sharing_Playbook_Published_v2.2.pdf">Data Sharing Playbook</a> is essentially a flowchart that navigates the stages of data sharing along with roles and responsibilities.

This network is a privately managed Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), wide area multi-carrier, national network (WAN) that supports multiple Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for public sector bodies. Key tenets of the GN are high speed, high capacity and resilient connections. The enhanced resilience that is built into GN through the use of MPLS is designed to ensure, in so far as is possible, that public sector bodies have several secure resilient paths both within and external to their own agency traffic be that voice, video or data. GN offers a number of potential cost and operational benefits: inter-agency collaboration and delivery of joined-up government services; access for all agencies to network capability and products/technology (regardless of size); execution of a number of standard day-to-day infrastructure services allowing agencies to focus on their core programmes and services; improvement of security for government information systems; internet access for agencies; and commercial advantages of an aggregated procurement approach, resulting in reduced costs and high quality services. </p><p>In 2018, through a coordinated and innovative nationwide approach to the delivery of connectivity, economies of scale have been achieved with standardised services to agencies in cities, towns and more remote locations where previously only limited services existed. The GN also supports centralised voice services and centralised corporate and guest Wi-Fi services, facilitating public service bodies to deploy secure wireless networks in multiple locations with minimum investment in infrastructure. This network also hosts the Gateways to the European Network of Administrations sTESTA. </p><p>Under the revised National Development Plan 2021-2030, a shared <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/68cc8-sustainability-and-climate-action-at-the-heart-of-key-ndp-funded-opw-projects/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="government data centre" resource="https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/68cc8-sustainability-and-climate-action-at-the-heart-of-key-ndp-funded-opw-projects/">Government Data Centre</a> is being built to aid in the upgrading of the Government&#x2019;s digital infrastructure and is anticipated to be completed by 2025. </p><p>The Government Networks Programme Board is currently undertaking a project to ensure that public administrations maximise the benefit from 5G technologies. This project consists in building a low latency platform with a high speed backbone using edge compute nodes to enable a faster response. This Platform will interconnect with the local access technologies of the carriers, including Stand-alone 5G as it becomes available nationwide, and will connect to Government and Commercial Datacentres as well as Cloud providers. This will allow for processing of data at the appropriate location, be that at an edge compute node, a regional compute node, or in the Cloud.</p><p>A variety of public services shall be subsequently developed, tested and deployed using the platform, notably for Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) and &#x201c;test before invest&#x201d; for SMEs and start-ups. The analysis and processing of information at the appropriate point will enable faster, more informed responses to incidents than human-reliant monitoring could provide. The Public Sectors and staff that will benefit from the proposal are public health, veterinary/agriculture inspectors, social workers, policing and local authorities etc. as the platform enables the provision of country-wide edge compute, enabling effective and responsive public services.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Death Events Publishing Service</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform runs the <a href="https://deathevents.gov.ie/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="death events publishing service" resource="https://deathevents.gov.ie/">Death Events Publishing Service</a>, distributing information on death events to a range of public sector bodies to take action as appropriate in relation to services that the deceased person(s) may have been receiving.
