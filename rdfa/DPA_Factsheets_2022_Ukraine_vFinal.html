The analysis&#x202f;is being&#x202f;conducted using a&#x202f;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzKVuEpnuAUlEELgZATwZqjQog96x5tJ7oNonqy_uSo/edit" target="_blank">methodology</a> which has been approved by the MDT. The purpose of this task is to analyse the legislative and financial aspects of ten public registries as well as the quality, accessibility and openness of their data. As part of this task, the experts have also analysed potential corruption-related activities that could take place within the registries (e.g., hostile takeovers) and they have provided recommendations on how to improve the current state of play of the analysed registries. According to the report, the most frequent corruption-related activities within the registries include: unauthorised registration, illegal registration (i.e., hostile takeovers), registration with forged documents or papers that don&#x2019;t exist, &#x2018;ghost&#x2019; payments (i.e., payments to deceased or non-existent persons), and data selling. The general recommendations on how to avoid these activities include: introducing automatic monitoring of risky registration actions to prevent illegal registration, adding a double verification process to check for the legality of the registrar&apos;s actions, improving technical and functional properties of registry software and its interactions with users (technical support); improving and centralising the management system of state registries (i.e. developing a single legislation framework, introducing a national system of accounting for intellectual property rights to State registry software and for licenses) and others. More detailed recommendations for each of the analysed registries can be found in the report.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eHealth Action Plan</p><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>Increasing the efficiency of social protection for citizens;</li><li>Improving the system to manage the financial resources of the social sector;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Automating management and control systems in the social sector; and</li><li>Using innovative IT technologies to manage the social sector. </li></ul><p>The Strategy also foresees:</p><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li>Developing the Single Social Sector Information System;</li><li>Developing the Single Social Registry;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Integrating the Single Social Registry with the State eServices Portal &#x201c;Diia&#x201d; to provide eServices in the social sector; and</li><li>Developing the &#x2018;social treasury&#x2019; that will allow for automated social benefits payments directly to citizens&#x2019; bank accounts.</li></ul><p>The official presentation of the Strategy is available <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/ador1231/ss-238599238?ref=https://thedigital.gov.ua/">via this link</a> (in Ukrainian). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Concept of Digital Competencies Development until 2025</p><ul><li>Providing access to educational materials;</li><li>Ensuring digital literacy for people of all ages;</li><li>Ensuring testing, in particular digital literacy testing;</li><li>Ensuring the receipt of electronic documents confirming training;</li><li>Developing an individual list of educational materials;</li><li>Displaying of news and research results in the field of education;</li><li>Distributing of digitalization ideas, bringing information about the latest digital technologies;</li><li>Providing information on enterprises, institutions and organizations that can provide access to digital education (digital education centres);</li><li>Using methods and mechanisms to improve learning outcomes; and</li><li>Protecting data (including personal ones) posted on the digital education web portal from unauthorized access, destruction and modification.</li></ul><p>The barrier-free space will be achieved through:</p><ul><li>Increased coverage of fixed and mobile broadband Internet access;</li><li>Computerisation and Internet connection of social infrastructure;</li><li>Creation of an accessible digital education system;</li><li>Increase of the digital accessibility of websites and applications; and</li><li>Digitisation of public services.</li></ul><h2>Emerging Technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><ul><li>Occupy a significant segment of the world market of AI technologies and a leading position in the international ranking (therefore attracting foreign investments in the industry);</li><li>Create conducive conditions for Ukraine&apos;s participation in the activities of international organizations and the implementation of initiatives for the definition of strategies for the development, regulation and standardisation of AI in the world;</li><li>Introduce AI technologies in such sectors as education, economics, public administration, cybersecurity, defence and other areas to increase Ukraine&apos;s long-term competitiveness in the international market; and</li><li>Develop an effective legal framework regulating AI technologies, taking into account international standards.</li></ul><ul><li>Developing a legislation framework to regulate AI solutions in Ukraine;</li><li>Developing information campaigns to promote AI in Ukraine;</li><li>State support to implement AI solutions in all sectors of the economy; and</li><li>Introducing AI solutions into the national cybersecurity infrastructure, etc.</li></ul><p>In addition, the MDT developed the catalogue of AI educational programs that are currently available in Ukrainian education institutions.

Additionally, it improves the accessibility of eServices for citizens and businesses while eliminating corruption risks resulting from the delivery of such services. The order states the necessity to conduct an audit of public information resources, including the analysis of legislation framework, technical capacities and the level of registry protection. Following the results of the audit, the responsible State bodies have to implement the single unique identifier of physical persons (unique registration number), to verify data in the State Demographic Registry and to ensure the electronic interaction between the registries with the final aim of minimising the number of personal inquiries to State bodies. Also, the order compels to develop a Diia State eServices Portal that will provide eServices to physical persons and legal entities based on the one-stop-shop principle.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Decree No. 56 on Some Issues of Digital Development </p><p>On 30 January 2019, the government approved a decree on <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/56-2019-ÃÂ¿">Some Issues of Digital Development</a>, which defined the digital-by-default principle.

Furthermore, this law anticipated the development of the State cybersecurity system and computer emergency response team <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/">CERT-UA</a>.

One of the articles in the draft law prohibits public authorities from requesting data from citizens if they already exist in the registries. After its implementation, citizens will not need to provide copies of their passports, ID numbers or else to obtain a public service. This means better quality and full automatization of public services delivery, which is the next step for going paperless in Ukraine. By law, all data interaction between the registries shall take place exclusively via the TREMBITA interoperability system.  It also regulates the functioning of the Registry of Registries (i.e. the catalogue of public registries). The draft law also mandates the creation of the national eArchive for long-term data preservation. This law allows saving public money by optimizing the number of electronic registries. Currently, there are more than 350 registries in Ukraine that need hundreds of millions of UAH for annual maintenance. For instance, the 25 key public registries alone need 500 million UAH for their annual maintenance. Optimizing the number&#xa0;of public registries and introducing data interaction between the existing ones will reduce their maintenance budget by up to 15%. The law regulates the self-efficiency of public registries and promotes the use of government data by businesses. The law suggests the financial model to financially support the system of public registries. From now on, businesses can purchase anonymised (i.e. open) data from public registries to develop the projects based on government data. The document establishes single technical rules for all state entities on how to create, maintain or delete registry files, which will increase the transparency in the sector and prevent illegal takeovers in public registries. The document allows citizens to have prompt access to up-to-date, government-held information about themselves (e.g., basic personal data, information on land ownership, real estate/property, aggregate income data). In case of any changes in personal information, the citizens will receive a notification about such changes, which will also facilitate the prevention of illegal takeovers in the registries.</li></ul><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Decree No. 985/2019 On the Pilot Project for the Implementation of Electronic Auctions to Sell the Tangible Assets of the State Material Reserve </p><p>On 4 December 2019, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/985-2019-ÃÂ¿">Decree No. 985 on </a>the <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/985-2019-ÃÂ¿">Pilot Project for the Implementation of Electronic Auctions to Sell the Tangible Assets of the State Material Reserve. </a>The decree defined the procedure for conducting the pilot project.

Previously, there was no clear understanding of the actual number of public services available or how to obtain them. Moreover, a single service could go by different names, and State authorities could demand different documents from citizens in order to provide the same service. This would create opportunities for petty corruption and waste citizens&#x2019; time and resources. Each service in the registry is assigned a unique code that is used when users receive services through the Diia portal and in ASCs. </p><p>When necessary, the registry also allows administrators to insert or edit the service description, and the registry contains a search function based on classifiers (i.e. categories, State entities, documents, results, life events, grounds for refusal). Currently, the guide contains information on over 2,200 public services (including electronic and paper-based services). The data on these services is divided into 17 categories of business activities and is arranged among 36 life events (e.g. starting a business, changing your place of residence, having a baby, or buying a vehicle; you can find all the information about where to obtain these services, their price, terms, etc. in the guide).
