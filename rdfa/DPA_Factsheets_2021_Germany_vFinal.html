The goal of the current strategy is to guide the country&apos;s eGovernment progress in the coming years. The strategy has been developed in cooperation with a broad spectrum of stakeholders from the fields of administration, politics, science and business.&#xa0;</p><p>The NEGS aims to ensure a common orientation for eGovernment activities and efforts at federal, State and local levels in order to establish an attractive eGovernment and IT approach for citizens and businesses.&#xa0;According to the new vision&#xa0;enshrined in the&#xa0;strategy, eGovernment should be characterised by&#xa0;five&#xa0;principles:</p><ul><li>Usefulness for citizens, businesses and public administration:&#xa0;potential eGovernment users should be fully aware of the services offered to them and be able to access them. In particular, broadband access in rural areas should be improved as well as citizens&apos; digital/media&#xa0;literacy;&#xa0;&#xa0;</li><li>Cost-effectiveness and efficiency:&#xa0;in order&#xa0;for&#xa0;the public administration to provide rapid, cost-effective&#xa0;and high-quality services, process chains within the public administration should be supported by electronic means&#xa0;and designed following a customer-centric approach. The various processes will be&#xa0;digitalised, with the&#xa0;federal&#xa0;government and the States putting the appropriate legal, organisational and technical instruments in place for ensuring the mandatory use of digital&#xa0;technologies; </li><li>Data&#xa0;protection, cyber security and transparency:&#xa0;data protection, security and transparency constitute important preconditions for the citizens to accept, trust and intensively use eGovernment. Therefore, the NEGS aims at ensuring data transparency and security by paying attention to only collect and process the data that is&#xa0;absolutely necessary&#xa0;for providing a particular administrative service. In addition, the protection of the providing systems is vital for the acceptance of eGovernment&#xa0;services;&#xa0;</li><li>Social&#xa0;participation and transparency:&#xa0;the&#xa0;active participation of citizens and businesses in policy as well as in planning and decision-making processes is fostered, as far as it is reasonable and allowed by law.&#xa0;The impact and&#xa0;the&#xa0;results of&#xa0;the&#xa0;participation should be made transparent to citizens and&#xa0;businesses; and</li><li>Innovation and sustainability:&#xa0;federal, State and local public administrations will support the capacity for innovation and openness to change through their own high-performance and client-oriented eGovernment offerings.&#xa0;</li></ul><p>The NEGS also contains&#xa0;six key principles&#xa0;that new legislations and initiatives should consider: </p><ul><li>Citizens and businesses&#xa0;should be able to carry out&#xa0;as many&#xa0;operations&#xa0;as possible from the same point of access, regardless of time and&#xa0;location;&#xa0;</li><li>Authorities should be able to cooperate quickly across different levels to minimise the administrative burden for citizens, businesses and public administration,&#xa0;e.g.&#xa0;by providing spatial data via the Spatial Data Infrastructure Germany initiative (GDI-DE); </li><li>Citizens and businesses should know which public authorities process their personal data. They should be confident that eGovernment is&#xa0;secure;&#xa0;</li><li>Citizens&#xa0;should be able to&#xa0;use electronic media to participate actively in the policy process and in organising the provision of public&#xa0;services;&#xa0;</li><li>The&#xa0;public administration should use cooperation models with the business and research community when developing and operating eGovernment solutions.&#xa0;This&#xa0;will enable innovative business models, through online services and&#xa0;information;&#xa0;and</li><li>Information security management&#xa0;should&#xa0;lead to a high level of IT security for eGovernment procedures and guarantee data confidentiality, integrity and availability.&#xa0;</li></ul><p>To this end, the BMI provides skills training for its own staff and employees of the whole federal administration as well as support in the form of consolidated administrative services to empower not only its own employees but also those of the whole federal administration. The BMI is the driver and guarantor of digital transformation and administrative modernisation; it stands for information and cyber security and technological sovereignty. In this context, data protection and transparency provide a basis for trust.</p><p>The plan covers the following points:</p><ol><li>Design effective data policy;</li><li>Increase cooperation at European level;</li><li>Establish an electronic identity;</li><li>Expand digital administrative services (Online Access Act); </li><li>Modernise the public administration and internal administrative services;</li><li>Set up an e-government unit as a digital innovation and transformation hub of the federal administration: a &#x201c;service by the administration for the administration&#x201d;;</li><li>Promote digital skills;</li><li>Safeguard the digital autonomy of Germany and Europe; and</li><li>Reinforce Germany&#x2019;s cyber security architecture.</li></ol><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Memorandum for the National eGovernment Strategy </p><p>At its fifth&#xa0;meeting on&#xa0;30 June 2011, the IT Planning Council took the first concrete steps towards the implementation of the National eGovernment Strategy, by publishing a&#xa0;memorandum, which outlines the agreed strategic goals. The focus was placed on building a federal infrastructure and aligning individual measurements. According to the memorandum, IT planning envisages the following priorities to be addressed: </p><ul><li>Transparent government and regulatory actions should be promoted by appropriate measures of IT and&#xa0;eGovernment; </li><li>Federal and State governments need to adapt to the IT processes and current threats from the&#xa0;internet. Therefore, minimum uniform standards for communication between government departments should be&#xa0;developed; </li><li>Develop a common&#xa0;eID&#xa0;strategy to enable citizens and businesses to securely transact with the administration over the internet. In this regard, the notification procedure to the European Commission for the German&#xa0;eID&#xa0;was fully finalised in 2017. As reported by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), &#x201c;the German&#xa0;eID&#xa0;fulfils all requirement of&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Level of Assurance high&#x201d;;&#xa0;</li><li>A&#xa0;federal information management system will bring together knowledge management faster and more efficiently to improve public&#xa0;services; </li><li>Sharing initiatives&#xa0;involving&#xa0;federal,&#xa0;State and local governments must be developed to save costs on IT-infrastructure;&#xa0;</li><li>The definition of IT security and IT interoperability standards is one of the main tasks of the IT Planning&#xa0;Board; and</li><li>The framework for levels across eGovernment should be further developed. The IT planning supports the coordinated activities of the federal and&#xa0;State laws to further adjust the regulatory framework.&#xa0;</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">IT Consolidation Programme of the German Federal Government&#xa0;</p><p>The German cabinet decided in&#xa0;the&#xa0;summer 2015 to substantially modernise the federal&#xa0;government in the IT department.&#xa0;Consolidating&#xa0;IT at federal level&#xa0;will serve several aims, namely:&#xa0;ensure information security in an increasingly complex&#x202f;IT&#x202f;environment; maintain sovereignty and control over federal&#x202f;IT&#x202f;also in the future; respond swiftly to technological innovations; ensure effective, efficient, stable and future-proof operations; and&#xa0;enable the government&#xa0;to&#xa0;remain an attractive employer for&#x202f;IT&#x202f;experts. Data of the federal administration must be comprehensively protected and secured against misuse. Until 2022,&#x202f;IT&#x202f;consolidation will follow three lines of action: consolidating operations, consolidating services, and centralising procurement.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">IT Strategy of the Federal Administration&#xa0;</p><p>The IT Strategy of the Federal Administration&#xa0;(<em>IT-Strategie&#xa0;der&#xa0;Bundesverwaltung</em>)&#xa0;defines ten cross-departmental goals for strategic&#xa0;IT&#xa0;development.&#xa0;With six overarching fields of action, the strategy sets priorities for the further development of IT and thus forms the basis for prioritising existing and future IT measures. To this end, the federal administration&apos;s IT strategy&#xa0;takes into account&#xa0;specifications and decisions at&#xa0;European&#xa0;as well as at&#xa0;national level.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Data Strategy of the German Federal Government </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Once-Only-Principle </p><p>&#xa0;</p><p>Citizens:&#xa0;</p><ul><li>Gain&#xa0;in transparency:&#xa0;citizens can track in their user accounts which authority has queried their data;&#xa0;</li><li>Quick notices: faster administrative services through interoperable data exchange;&#xa0;</li><li>Proactive eGovernment&#xa0;services: the offer of proactive eGovernment&#xa0;services without time-consuming applications can be increased by reusing citizen&#xb4;s data;&#xa0;and</li><li>Administrative burden: reduce administrative burden as citizens only have to submit data once.&#xa0;</li></ul><p>&#xa0;</p><p>Administration<strong>:</strong>&#xa0;</p><ul><li>Efficiency gain: faster and more efficient processing thanks to simplified data exchange;&#xa0;</li><li>Networking: closer exchange of knowledge between administrations through co-creation and collaboration;&#xa0;</li><li>Growth dynamics: a dynamic European single market thanks to lower barriers between States; and&#xa0;</li><li>Validity: valid, forgery-proof data in high quality from an authentic source.&#xa0;</li></ul><p>&#xa0;</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Architectural&#xa0;Guideline&#xa0;for&#xa0;Federal&#xa0;IT&#xa0;</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Broadband&#xa0;Atlas&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Government Partnership&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Geoinformation Strategy&#xa0;</p><p>The federal Geoinformation Strategy&#xa0;(<em>Nationale&#xa0;Geoinformationss<s>-S</s>trategie</em>) was adopted by representatives of the federal administration, country representatives and local authorities in 2015.&#xa0;The strategy follows the aim to secure basic services, facilitate multiple use and promote innovation for a forward-looking and sustainable&#xa0;geographic information policy.

Due to some more recent EU directives that did impose temporal deadlines for the implementation of eProcurement in EU Member States, the modernisation process started in 2018, when the federal electronic tendering platform was launched successfully. Yet, it will take some more time to achieve the degree of functional integration between the eProcurement systems at all three levels that is necessary to satisfy the needs of all stakeholders involved. </p><p>Already in place is the online procurement platform. The entire procedures for public procurement below EU thresholds will be digitised just like public procurement above the EU thresholds.

At the same time, the process should orientate itself towards current technological developments by providing, for instance, user-friendly applications. Examples of these are: Demonstrator (prototype),&#xa0;ePlanning&#xa0;and Text-matching (restricted access).&#xa0;The electronic Sustainability Impact Assessment (eNAP) application makes it easier to check the sustainability of draft laws and ordinances.

Based on a decision of the IT Planning Council, a national stakeholder network for the SDG implementation was set up in April 2019. It consisted of SDG multipliers appointed by each of the 16 federal&#xa0;States, the national coordinator appointed by the federal government, contact persons of the&#xa0;federal&#xa0;ministries and representatives of the leading municipal associations. The network will meet at least twice a year. On 21 May 2019, a national kick-off meeting for SDG implementation took place at the German&#xa0;Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community&#xa0;in Berlin.</p><p>The implementation of the SDG regulation was an integral part of the implementation of the German&#xa0;Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services&#xa0;(<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz,&#xa0;</em>OZG). A major screening process of the SDG regulation took place to identify the concrete implementation requirements on all administrative levels. The aim of this screening process was to set up a detailed requirement catalogue for the project managers of the current digitalisation initiatives (portal network, digitalisation programme, service accounts, Federal Information Management - FIM, IT consolidation at federal level, modernisation of registries, among others). A 280-page&#xa0;checklist was published to provide detailed information about the requirements of the German Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services. In addition, the SDG implementation requirements featured&#xa0;a new website&#xa0;that gives citizens an overview of which eGovernment Services will be digitalised and which are already available online. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services&#xa0;</p><p>On 18 August 2017, the&#xa0;Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services&#xa0;(<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG) entered into force. The federal, regional and local levels of government&#xa0;are&#xa0;now required to take comprehensive measures in order to promote electronic government services.&#xa0;Core requirements include:&#xa0;</p><ul><li>All (suitable) administrative services must be available online within five years after the law&#x2019;s entry into&#xa0;force;&#xa0;</li><li>Federal and municipal eGovernment services must be available both through a newly created federal online portal and the online portals of the&#xa0;federal States<em>&#xa0;(L&#xe4;nder)</em>. All portals are meant be connected to a network of portals, the&#xa0;<em>Portalverbund</em>. Thus, access to electronic government services becomes easier and more&#xa0;user-friendly; and</li><li>Access to all administrative services in the portal network must be allowed via a secure single-user account. In the user account, personal data (e.g.&#xa0;date of birth, residence) can be stored permanently for the users&#x2019; convenience, provided they have given their consent.&#xa0;</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act&#xa0;on the&#xa0;Promotion of&#xa0;Electronic&#xa0;Government&#xa0;</p><p>On 17 June 2013, the Bundestag, with the approval of the Bundesrat, adopted the&#xa0;Act&#xa0;on the&#xa0;promotion of&#xa0;electronic government&#xa0;(eGovernment Act,&#xa0;EGovG). The German law for the promotion of eGovernment came into effect on 1 August 2013. Its aim was to facilitate electronic communication with the administration and to enable federal,&#xa0;State&#xa0;and local authorities to provide simpler, more user-friendly and efficient eGovernment services. The main provisions&#xa0;include:&#xa0;</p><p>&#xa0;</p><ul><li>Obligation for federal, State and local authorities to open a point of access for the transfer of electronic&#xa0;documents;&#xa0;</li><li>Obligation for federal authorities to open a De-Mail access and to offer an electronic proof of identity via electronic identity (eID) card and electronic residence&#xa0;permit;&#xa0;</li><li>Electronic record&#xa0;keeping;&#xa0;</li><li>Enabling electronic evidence and electronic payment in administrative&#xa0;procedures;&#xa0;</li><li>Obligation to document and analyse processes before implementing IT&#xa0;systems;&#xa0;</li><li>Provision of machine-readable data (open data); and&#xa0;</li><li>Georeferencing of electronic registers.&#xa0;</li></ul><p>The eGovernment Act triggered legislative activities in most of the German federal&#xa0;States. By now,&#xa0;seven&#xa0;federal&#xa0;States have already adopted their own eGovernment Act, while several others have initiated legislative procedures.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">German Basic Law (Articles 91c and 91d)&#xa0;</p><p>On 1 August 2009, within the framework of the second round of reforms of Germany&apos;s federal structure, important changes in the&#xa0;German Basic Law&#xa0;(<em>Grundgesetz</em>) came into force with articles 91c and 91d. Article 91c ensured the simplification of IT bodies and decision-making processes, thus increasing their effectiveness and enabling their adaptation to the needs of the fast-evolving technical progress.&#xa0;The German federation now has the exclusive legislative competence for the development of a secure linking-up network to interconnect the IT networks of national and federal States, which can prevent any underlying media issues. Furthermore, Article 91d constituted a vital component for administrative modernisation as it provides the legal basis for facilitating the federation and the federal States to directly and effectively benchmark their administrations in order to increase their effectiveness and&#xa0;transparency and&#xa0;provide better public services.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on the Connection of Information Technology Networks of Federal and State Governments&#xa0;</p><p>The envisaged objectives of the German Basic Law are implemented through&#xa0;the connection of IT networks of federal and State governments (IT-NetzG),&#xa0;adopted on 10 August 2009, as well as through an Inter-federal State Agreement, which came into force on 1 April 2010. According to this agreement, the IT Planning Council was established and tasked with developing the technical requirements for the use of the core network infrastructure. Moreover, the IT Planning Council bears the responsibility to steer cross-disciplined eGovernment projects involving both the federation and the federal States. Finally, the Council adopts decisions on IT interoperability and security standards.&#xa0;</p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Register Modernisation Act</p><p>The Register Modernisation Act (<em>Registermodernisierungsgesetz</em>) constitutes a major improvement in the provision of administrative services in line with the Online Access Act. European provisions &#x2013; in particular the Single Digital Gateway Regulation&#xa0;&#x2013; oblige the German authorities to put the so-called Once-Only principle into practice. The act introduces a biunique, trans-sectoral identification number in the German administration in line with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). The legislation also provides changes in the German fiscal code and other technical items of legislation to enable the processing of the identification number in order to provide administrative services in line with the Online Access Act. The implementation of the legislation is embedded in a roadmap for a modernised register landscape adopted by the federal government and the L&#xe4;nder.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on&#xa0;the Reuse of Public Sector Information&#xa0;</p><p>The Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information (Directive (EU) 2019/1024) entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive (Directive 2003/98/EC), which was amended&#xa0;by Directive 2013/37/EU. Member States must transpose Directive (EU) 2019/1024 by 16 July 2021. Once fully transposed at national level, it will promote all public sector content that is in principle freely available for re-use, except in very limited cases. It will stimulate the transparency, non-discrimination and non-exclusivity of data. Furthermore, real-time data available via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), open access to publicly funded research data and high value datasets will stimulate innovation and benefit both society and the economy.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Freedom of&#xa0;Information&#xa0;Act&#xa0;</p><p>After being narrowly approved by the Bundestag in early June 2005, Germany&#x2019;s&#xa0;Freedom of information (FOI) Act&#xa0;was voted on 8 July 2005 by the Bundesrat, published in the Federal Gazette on 13 September 2005 and came into force on 1 January 2006. The law provided the public with a general right to access&#xa0;federal government information. However, this general right was limited by several broadly defined exemptions, covering, for instance, security-sensitive issues, potential threats to public safety and even the &#x201c;fiscal interests of the federal government&#x201d;. The legislation also contained an &#x2018;internet clause&#x2019; to compel federal administration bodies to make a few items publicly available online. Certain federal States also have their own Freedom of Information Legislation.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Data Act (Article 12a)&#xa0;</p><p>The principle of open data is becoming increasingly important worldwide and the availability of data is becoming an important economic factor.&#xa0;</p><p>Considering this, on 18 May 2017, the German Bundestag passed the draft&#xa0;Federal Open Data Act&#xa0;amending the eGovernment Act, presented by the Federal Minister of the Interior, which introduced a cultural change in the administrations and obliges federal authorities to publish unprocessed data in the future. </p><p>The law sets out common criteria for open data. These include free of charge provision, free access to the data, as well as machine readability. At the same time, data protection applies, ensuring that only data suitable for publication is provided.&#xa0;</p><p>The nation-wide metadata portal&#xa0;GovData&#xa0;was created to ensure that the open data provided by the different administrations can be easily found.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Draft Legislation Introducing a Card for EU Citizens and Members of the&#xa0;European Economic Area </p><p>The&#xa0;draft legislation introducing a card for EU citizens and members of the European Economic Area&#xa0;(<em>Gesetz zur Einf&#xfc;hrung einer Karte f&#xfc;r Unionsb&#xfc;rger und Angeh&#xf6;rige des Europ&#xe4;ischen Wirtschaftsraums mit Funktion zum elektronischen Identit&#xe4;tsnachweis sowie zur &#xc4;nderung des Personalausweisgesetzes und weiterer Vorschriften</em>) was&#xa0;prepared&#xa0;in 2018 and was&#xa0;adopted&#xa0;by&#xa0;the&#xa0;German&#xa0;parliament&#xa0;in June 2019.&#xa0;It introduced the electronic ID card for a larger circle of people. The card is not mandatory and is available upon request for citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area. The&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card is not a classic ID since it has an electronic chip that contains the most important personal information (more specifically, name, date and place of birth, address).&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Brexit Withdrawal Agreement&#xa0;</p><p>The persons&#xa0;covered by the Brexit withdrawal agreement will also be&#xa0;issued an&#xa0;electronic residence permit with integrated&#xa0;eID.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eIDAS&#xa0;Implementation Act&#xa0;</p><p>Since 1 July 2016, the&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Regulation&#xa0;has been the single legal framework for electronic trust services across the EU. In Germany, the&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Implementation Act&#xa0;entered into force on 29 July 2017. The core of the&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Implementation Act was the Trust&#xa0;Services Act (VDG). It regulates the national requirements for the effective implementation of the&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Regulation. On 28 February 2019, the Trust Services Ordinance (VDV) came into force, providing the final specifications on the requirements for trust services and trust service providers, such as accessibility and financial security.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Identification Promotion Act&#xa0;</p><p>The&#xa0;Electronic Identification Promotion Act&#xa0;came into force on 15 July 2017. It aimed to promote the use and dissemination of online identification through the German&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card, making it easier and more secure.&#xa0;The&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card has an electronic proof of identity function and was introduced in 2010. This feature enables citizens, government agencies and businesses to reliably identify themselves on the internet. However, the use of the&#xa0;eID&#xa0;function&#xa0;lagged behind&#xa0;the expectations. In order to address this situation, since 15 July 2017, each new identity card is issued with a ready-to-use electronic identification function. With the Electronic Identification Promotion Act, several other additional measures were taken in order to promote the usage of the national&#xa0;eID&#xa0;function. The responsible data protection authorities monitor compliance with data protection.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Signature Act&#xa0;</p><p>The German&#xa0;Electronic Signature Act&#xa0;came into force on 22 May 2001, implementing&#xa0;EU Directive 1999/93/EC&#xa0;on a Community framework for electronic signatures and replacing the previous Digital Signature Act that was adopted as part of the Information and Communication Services Act of 1 August 1997. It regulated the necessary secure infrastructure for the use of electronic signatures, which received the same legal status as hand-written signatures. It was complemented by an&#xa0;Ordinance on Electronic Signatures&#xa0;of 16 November 2001 setting out standard requirements and responsibilities for certification authorities, as well as minimum requirements for technical components used to create digital signatures. The Digital Signature Act was amended by&#xa0;the&#xa0;Signature Act (1.&#xa0;Sig&#xc4;ndG) of 04/01/2005.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal Data Protection Act&#xa0;</p><p>Germany has one of the strictest data protection laws in the European Union. The world&apos;s first data protection law was passed in the federal&#xa0;State Hessen in 1970. In 1977, a Federal Data Protection Law followed, which was replaced in 1990, and amended in 1994 and 1997. An additional revision took place in August 2002 to align German legislation with the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC). </p><p>On 6 April 2016, the EU agreed to a major reform of its data protection framework by adopting the data protection reform package. It comprised the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679&#xa0;- GDPR), replacing Directive 95/46/EC and the Police Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680). The GDPR entered into force on 25 May 2018 and became directly applicable. The GDPR was designed to harmonise data privacy laws across Europe and strengthen the protection of the individual&#x2019;s right to personal data protection in order to guarantee the free flow of personal data between EU&#xa0;Member States. However, the GDPR permitted Member States to modify several provisions under certain conditions via local legislation (opening clauses). In order to keep the quality of German data protection standards,&#xa0;Germany used&#xa0;several opening clauses&#xa0;and&#xa0;adopted the&#xa0;Act to Adapt Data Protection Law&#xa0;to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and to Implement Directive (EU) 2016/680,&#xa0;including a&#xa0;Federal Data Protection Act.&#xa0;The amendments came into force in May 2018.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Commercial Registry&#xa0;</p><p>The most important legislation&#xa0;for the Commercial Registry&#xa0;is the&#xa0;German Commercial Code. Part II, Article 8, states that the Commercial Registry is under the control&#xa0;of the courts, and the right to inspect the Registry is open to everyone. Copies of&#xa0;the&#xa0;entries&#xa0;can&#xa0;be obtained upon&#xa0;request&#xa0;and can be authenticated. Another important regulation is the&#xa0;Commercial Registry Regulation.&#xa0;According to article 3, the Commercial Registry&#xa0;addresses&#xa0;two&#xa0;categories: individual merchants and registered joint stock companies. Information regarding the electronic maintenance of the Commercial Registry, recorded files, registry folders and inspections can also be found in the regulation.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Population Registry&#xa0;</p><p>The Population Registry falls under the&#xa0;Federal Registration Act&#xa0;(BMG). The Act does not provide a definition&#xa0;of&#xa0;the Population Registry, but it regulates areas such as the required reference data to be registered, registration authorities and their duties, storage of data, accuracy and completeness of the Population Registry, information restrictions, storage and deletion of data, registration certificates, use restrictions, automatic retrieval and data transfer.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Land Registry&#xa0;</p><p>Both&#xa0;the&#xa0;Land Registration Code (<em>Grundbuchordnung</em>&#xa0;-&#xa0;GBO) and the&#xa0;Civil Code&#xa0;(BGB) contain paragraphs which are relevant to the&#xa0;Land&#xa0;Registry. The&#xa0;<em>Grundbuchordnung</em>&#xa0;places more emphasis on governing the procedural part, the required processes and formalities. Its articles cover information such as the entries to be made in the Registry,&#xa0;the rectification&#xa0;of the data, the exchange of copies of the Land Registries, public charges, access to basic files and more. The Civil Code&#xa0;covers such items as land&#xa0;leases, rental fees, annuities and property management.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Official Contracting Terms for Award of Service Performance Contracts&#xa0;</p><p>The&#xa0;government&#xa0;transposed&#xa0;Directive&#xa0;2004/17/EC, Directive&#xa0;2004/18/EC&#xa0;and Directive&#xa0;2005/51/EC&#xa0;into national law when the official contracting terms for&#xa0;the&#xa0;award of service performance contracts were published on 6 June 2006. The original contracting terms were subsequently simplified through the&#xa0;Contract Awards for Public Supplies and Services-Part A (VOL/A)&#xa0;published on 29 December 2009 in the Federal Gazette (Volume 61, No. 196a), again with a corresponding correction published on 29 February 2010. The amended&#xa0;Procurement&#xa0;Ordinance&#xa0;(<em>Vergabeverordnung</em>,&#xa0;VgV), which came into force on 11 June 2010, regulated the submission of electronic bids in the area of public procurement.&#xa0;</p><p>On 1 December 2016, the Bundestag adopted the Law on the Transposition of Directive&#xa0;on electronic invoicing&#xa0;in&#xa0;public procurement (Directive 2014/55/EU). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing </p><p>In Germany, the competence in the field of&#xa0;eInvocing&#xa0;is shared between the&#xa0;Federal Ministry of the Interior&#xa0;(at the federal level) and the&#xa0;federal&#xa0;States. The legislation in place&#xa0;makes reference&#xa0;to the&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;Law&#xa0;of&#xa0;4 April 2017 (<em>E-Rechnungsgesetz</em>), which mandates the receipt and processing of&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;for all federal contracting authorities.&#xa0;As far as other State and local entities are concerned, they shall rely on supplementary legislation by the federal States. Following a decision by the National IT Planning Council in June 2017, XRechnung, the German Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS) based on the European Norm 16931, has become the leading&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;standard for central, regional and local authorities in Germany. Furthermore, the&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;platform was activated by the federal government for B2G public procurement at the end of 2018. Since November 2019, B2G&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;is mandatory in Germany for all government bodies at national level. B2G&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;became mandatory also at regional and municipal level on 18 April 2020.&#xa0;</p><h2>Domain-specific legislation</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Commerce Act&#xa0;</p><p>The Electronic Commerce Act of 14 December 2001 implemented the EU eCommerce Directive (2000/31/EC) into German law. The Act amended the&#xa0;Tele Services Act&#xa0;and the&#xa0;Tele Services Data Protection Act&#xa0;of 1997&#xa0;(both of which had been adopted as part of the Information and Communication Services Act of 1 August 1997), as well as&#xa0;some provisions&#xa0;of the German Civil Code.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act&#xa0;on&#xa0;De-Mail Services and Amendments to other Legislation&#xa0;</p><p>The&#xa0;Act&#xa0;on&#xa0;De-Mail services and Amendments to Other&#xa0;Legislation&#xa0;contains the legal requirements for registration as a De-Mail provider. The draft was adopted by the federal cabinet on 13 October 2010 and entered into force on 3 May 2011. De-Mail enables the sending of traceable and confidential documents and messages online. Contrary to conventional e-mails, De-Mails provide proof of delivery. It is not possible to read or manipulate the contents of a De-Mail on its journey across the internet. De-Mail providers are interoperable and provide the same level of security based on an accreditation process that is specified by the legislator. De-Mail providers&#xa0;have to&#xa0;fulfil high requirements concerning security, functions, interoperability and data protection. Furthermore, the De-Mail legislation foresees that providers must not only furnish the stated certificates for security, functionality and interoperability, but must also demonstrate comprehensive measures to protect personal data within the scope of the accreditation procedure.&#xa0;</p><p>The basic specifications for security, functionality and interoperability were drawn up by the federal government together with future De-Mail providers and laid down in technical guidelines. To ensure compliance with these guidelines, De-Mail providers are screened in an accreditation process.&#xa0;De-Mail focuses&#xa0;on data protection&#xa0;and requires, for instance, that De-Mail providers can enable the&#xa0;use&#xa0;of e-mail&#xa0;pseudonyms to prevent communications&#xa0;or consumer profiles traceability. Furthermore, when requested De-Mail providers must store the&#xa0;user&#x2019;s&#xa0;encryption certificates in the directory to support (additional) end-to-end encryption of De-Mails.&#xa0;</p><p>The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has published the approval criteria on its&#xa0;website.&#xa0;</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p>No legislation&#xa0;has been&#xa0;adopted in this field to date.&#xa0;</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-491.jpeg" alt="A picture containing outdoor, sky, flag

This platform took the shape of a joint network of the administrative portals at the federal and state level. The portals are structured according to life and business situations. Municipal portals and services are connected to the portal network via state portals. To allow for simple and secure processing of eGovernment offers, users are provided with service accounts,&#xa0;similar to&#xa0;customer accounts in online commerce, which also feature post office box functions. In order to save time and costs, the portal network builds on existing solutions. </p><p>In 2018, the German Federal government launched a newly revised portal that provides access to eGovernment services of the federal authorities via a federal service account. This account complied with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC - in short,&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Regulation. Federal ministries and government agencies using this account automatically complied with EU requirements that came into force in September 2018. As part of the portal network, the new administrative portal will eventually also offer access to procedures and services within the jurisdiction of the federal States and municipalities. The legal basis for the entire project was the so-called&#xa0;Online Access&#xa0;Act&#xa0;which came into force in August 2017. </p><p>The digitalisation initiative is flanked by the digitalisation programme of the IT Planning Council, a central body in which federal and State authorities work together on issues of IT in the public sector. Within this programme, selected administrative procedures with high relevance for citizens and companies were digitalised. These procedures were made available online nationwide via the portal network.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">GovData&#xa0;Portal&#xa0;</p><p>The German data portal&#xa0;GovData&#xa0;provides a unified, centralised access to administrative data from federal, State and local governments. The goal is to make this data accessible in one single place and thus easier to use for both citizens and businesses. In the spirit of the Open Data principle, the portal aims to promote the use of open licenses and increase the supply of machine-readable raw data.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Subnational Portals</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><em>Portalverbund</em>&#xa0;</p><p>At the moment&#xa0;subnational and regional portals run independently.

Until July 2006, the IVBB also provided access to the IVBB intranet, which was replaced by the Federal Intranet (Intranet des&#xa0;Bundes). The new intranet portal features new content, services and workflows, such as a search engine, a travel management system and access to information and document databases for people and federal agencies.&#xa0;</p><p>The IVBV is a private IP-based communication network, which serves as intranet among the different public administration departments. Its infrastructure facilitates the incorporation of the Berlin&#x2011;Bonn Information Network (IVBB) as well as of other networks of the federal administration into a comprehensive IP-based network, featuring, amongst others, a firewall system, comprehensive encryption of the data communication and permanent observation of the connected users and the established connections.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal Networks </p><p>The&#xa0;Federal Networks&#xa0;(<em>Netze&#xa0;des&#xa0;Bundes&#xa0;</em>-&#xa0;NdB) replace the Berlin-Bonn Information Network (IVBB) and the Information Network of the Federal Administration (IVBV) and increase the efficiency and security (in terms of availability and privacy) of the networks involved. The aim is to create a common infrastructure for the federal government in the long term.&#xa0;NdB&#xa0;provides the main federal authorities with central&#xa0;internet&#xa0;access and networking services. In 2006, the Federal Intranet (Intranet des&#xa0;Bundes) was introduced. The intranet portal features services and workflows, such as&#xa0;a&#xa0;search engine, a travel management system and access to information and document databases for people and federal agencies.&#xa0;NdB&#xa0;is a&#xa0;private IP-based communication network, which serves as intranet among the different&#xa0;public administration departments. </p><p>The importance of network infrastructures has changed over the last 20 years. Today network infrastructures are essential for the modern administration.&#xa0;Nearly every public authority needs special IT procedures to perform its&#xa0;tasks. </p><p>Due to the increased threat level by highly developed malware (e.g.&#xa0;Trojan software),&#xa0;NdB&#xa0;fulfils the&#xa0;highest connection&#xa0;security requirements&#xa0;at federal and State level.&#xa0;Therefore,&#xa0;NdB&#xa0;provides firewall systems, comprehensive encryption of the data communication and permanent observation of the connected users and the established connections.&#xa0;</p><p>The sponsor&#xa0;for&#xa0;NdB&#xa0;is&#xa0;the&#xa0;<em>Beauftragte f&#xfc;r Informationstechnik der Bundesregierung</em> (BfIT).&#xa0;The&#xa0;BDBOS&#xa0;is responsible for the operation of&#xa0;NdB.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Deutschland-Online Infrastructure</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">De-Mail&#xa0;</p><p>De-Mail&#xa0;is an easy-to-use technology that takes conventional e-mail one step further as it allows citizens, businesses and administrations to exchange electronic messages in a secure manner. Compared to conventional e-mails, the delivery of De-Mails and the identity of senders and recipients can be proven. It is not possible to read or manipulate the contents of a De-Mail on its journey across the internet. One important aim is to make De-Mail confidential, reliable and binding through basic security functions that are easy to use and do not require additional installations for the end-user. The sender and recipient of a De-Mail can be clearly identified. Send and delivery certificates can be easily generated.</p><p>De-Mails are encrypted during transport and can neither be intercepted nor manipulated. Spam and phishing are effectively prevented because the De-Mail sender can be clearly identified by secure initial identification and users are able to log on with two-factor authentication using the new German&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card or a mobile phone-based method (mobile TAN). </p><p>Furthermore, De-Mail offers huge potential to optimise electronic communications in the private and public sector. Recently, business and administration processes were marked by media inconsistencies that produced considerable delays and additional costs. With the additional security functions that De-Mail provides, a large part of today&#x2019;s paper-based business and administration processes can now be handled fully electronically, simply, quickly and from any location. </p><p>The legal requirements&#xa0;for registration as De-Mail provider&#xa0;are contained in the&#xa0;Act&#xa0;on&#xa0;De-Mail services and amendments to other legislation, which entered into force on 3 May 2011. So far,&#xa0;inter alia Deutsche Telekom AG, GMX.DE, WEB.DE and&#xa0;Mentana&#xa0;GmbH have become accredited De-Mail providers. </p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Identity Card&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Passport (ePass)&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Signature Alliance&#xa0;</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eTendering&#xa0;Platform (XVergabe)&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal eProcurement Platform (eVergabe) </p><p>The&#xa0;eVergabe&#xa0;project&#xa0;was considered to be&#xa0;one of the most important projects of the&#xa0;BundOnline&#xa0;2005 initiative. The service features&#xa0;the electronic awarding of orders based on communications between the awarding agency and potential bidders that are comprehensive, legally binding and free from media discontinuities. The offering&#xa0;ranges&#xa0;from notification via electronic tender submission to contract award using the contract award platform. The documents&#xa0;containing&#xa0;the contract terms can be downloaded and bids can be submitted with an electronic signature. The&#xa0;eAward&#xa0;project falls within the remit of the&#xa0;Procurement Agency&#xa0;of the Federal Ministry of the Interior&#xa0;(BMI).&#xa0;In technical terms, the service&#xa0;was&#xa0;implemented as a web-based transactional platform using Java clients&#xa0;and&#xa0;combined with a&#xa0;web&#xa0;interface&#xa0;to search&#xa0;for tenders. In addition to the&#xa0;eVergabe&#xa0;platform, all public tenders from this platform were automatically published online on&#xa0;bund.de.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal eGovernment Shop (<em>Kaufhaus des&#xa0;Bundes</em>)&#xa0;</p><p>The Federal eProcurement Platform, the Procurement Agency of the Federal Ministry of the Interior also developed the Federal&#xa0;eGovernment shop (<em>Kaufhaus des&#xa0;Bundes</em>,&#xa0;KdB). With this solution, ordering materials takes place through an electronic catalogue. Supplies of printing paper, for instance, are ordered with a few clicks. Even customised PCs and cars can be ordered online directly from the company. Conservative calculations estimate that each electronically-executed order via&#xa0;KdB&#xa0;saves at least 377 minutes (which equals EUR 195 of personnel expenses) compared to the simplest form of single tender action. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">E-Rechnung&#xa0;</p><p>The&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;service of the federal government was completed on 27 November 2019.
