Austria was one of the first EU Member States to adopt a comprehensive legislation on eGovernment. This act is the core of Austrian laws on eGovernment. It serves as the legal basis for eGovernment instruments and components. Many mechanisms - such as the Citizen Card (<em>B&#xfc;rgerkarte</em>; in the future, eID or ID Austria), sector-specific personal identifiers and electronic delivery - can also be put to use in the private sector.</p><p>The most important principles of eGovernment law are:</p><ul><li>freedom of choice for users in selecting the means of communication when contacting public authorities; and</li><li>security and improved legal protection provided by appropriate technical measures such as the Citizen Card.</li></ul><p>The recent amendments to the eGovernment Act, which entered into force on 31 December 2020, were made in consideration of the technical developments associated with a simplified smartphone-based use of the eID, as well as to increase the data quality and widen the use of the eID.

Thus, certain information (birth certificates, proof of citizenship, proof of residency or documents from the Commercial Registry) need no longer be provided by the person concerned but can, with the person&#x2019;s consent or with legal authorisation, be directly requested by the authority from an electronic register.

Although the SVG applies to all trust services, the creation, validation and preservation of electronic signatures continue to be the core. It therefore continues to be possible to sign contracts electronically with an electronic signature with the same effect as if the contract were signed by hand. In addition, an important step for consumer protection was made with the SVG: companies can no longer exclude in hidden clauses the acceptance of the electronic signature and thus, for example, prevent electronic terminations of subscriptions.</p><p>The last amendments to the act, made on 17 May 2018 and 27 December 2018, regarded the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Security of Network and Information Systems Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20010536" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Security of Network and Information Systems Act</a><span resource="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20010536" property="eli:title" content="Security of Network and Information Systems Act"/> was adopted on 28 December 2018 in order to transpose the European <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&amp;uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Directive concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems (NIS Directive)</a><span resource="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&amp;uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG" property="eli:title" content="Directive concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems (NIS Directive)"/>.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Data Protection Act</p><p>The Austrian <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.pdf" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Data Protection Act</a><span resource="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.pdf" property="eli:title" content="Data Protection Act"/> (<em>Datenschutzgesetz</em> 2000; DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999) came into effect on 1 January 2000.

This central system is called MyPostbox (<em>meinpostkorb</em>). The revised electronic delivery offers great saving potential for public authorities, citizens and businesses (e.g. postage costs, printing costs and time). The display module MyPostbox bundles documents from different delivery systems into a common view and allows for a single point of registration.
