The&#xa0;government&#x2019;s main objective has been a continuous optimisation in terms of process efficiency and customer-friendly design for the national administration. This applies to administrative processes as well as to the concerns and needs of the population, companies and other stakeholders. In the course of this legislative period, a series of measures have strengthened the service of the State administration with a strong focus on electronic means of communication. The programme presented decisive opportunities and addresses some primary challenges posed by digitisation. </p><p>The Digital Agenda has been a central field of action for the legislature. There was a general consensus that administration services should be offered electronically and made available around the clock. In this context, there was also awareness that when official business is conducted via electronic means, data security and privacy must be a high priority. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eGovernment Strategy 2019-2023</p><p>The <a href="https://www.regierung.li/media/attachments/ikr-eGovernmentStrategie-A4-D.PDF?t=636911057929590704">eGovernment Strategy</a> is based on the knowledge gained from the implementation of an earlier strategy dating back a decade. In March 2019, the government presented its overarching considerations for future digitisation and formulated concrete fields of action articulated in objectives and measures. The new revised eGovernment Strategy includes a vision, principles and guidelines for the implementation of digital services as well as defined areas of action. The strategy will be implemented by means of individual projects.</p><p>Although the State administration relies heavily on eGovernment, citizens continue to enjoy non-electronic access to all administrative services. However, eGovernment should facilitate access to administrative services and make business transactions more efficient. The administration thus enables a customer-friendly, personal and competent service, both electronically and non-electronically.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects </h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Blockchain Partnership</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big data </h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud computing</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance computing</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-613.jpeg" alt="A picture containing floor, indoor
