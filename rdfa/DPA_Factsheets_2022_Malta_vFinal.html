It sets out how the government will act not only in its traditional role as promoter and regulator, but also as incubator and accelerator for change towards digitalisation. </p><p>Undoubtedly, attention must also be paid to a number of enablers, among which  those related to regulation and legislation, digital infrastructure and funding, as well as cybersecurity, data and eSkills are key.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Maltese government signed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment &#x2013; together with other EU Member States &#x2013; to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">New Strategy for the Public Service &#x2013; Achieving a Service of Excellence</p><p>In December 2021, the public service launched a new strategy for the next five years, called <a href="https://publicservice.gov.mt/en/Documents/Achieving-A-Service-of-Excellence-2021.pdf">Achieving a Service of Excellence</a>. A steering committee headed by the Principal Permanent Secretary was set up and four working groups reporting to this committee were formed: three groups were exclusively focused on the three main pillars this strategy is based on - people, technology and services, while the fourth group was focused on drafting the final document. The vision outlines what the forty-five main initiatives and eleven strategic objectives captured in the plan aim to achieve &#x2013; a seamless public service that is accountable, sustainable and that continually strives to provide a service of excellence. A study on public service renewal commissioned in 2020 highlighted the need to focus the efforts on improving the quality of services, the accountability towards clients, as well as the sustainability as a large organisation. Public service values are intended to inspire respect, promote ethical conduct, acknowledge the highest integrity standards, safeguard clients&#x2019; rights, and promote a culture that embraces honesty, correctness and professionalism. In order to support these values, a set of guiding principles have been identified &#x2013; effective leadership, holistic people management and employee empowerment, ongoing measurement, continuous improvement, decision making and policy making and client centricity. A strategic plan with tangible outcomes and milestones was compiled and for each initiative and strategic objective a champion has been identified.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Centralised Digital Enabling Services Policy</p><p>The <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GMICT_P_0121_Centralised_Digital_Enabling_Services.pdf">policy</a> published in December 2019 aims to encourage the use of centralised digital enabling services within the public administration and guide the adoption of alternative services in order to ensure data security. The policy recommends that all government bodies and agencies should, unless they have specific needs, give priority to the following centralised digital enabling services provided by the government:</p><ul><li>Cloud services, especially for storing, processing, transmitting or sharing classified information;</li><li>Electronic payment service (government payment gateway)</li><li>Notifications service and</li><li>Video streaming service.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Data Strategy</p><p>The National Data Strategy 2022&#x2013;2027 (to be published in 2022) aims to build upon the exponential growth of data and the various technologies used for its collection, processing, storage, preservation and transmission, whilst also addressing the challenges met on a national scale over the past years. It aims to engender the general principles of fairness and transparency so that individuals, and public and private sector organisations can process data to the maximum extent possible, as permitted by the law, for the benefit of natural or legal persons owning that data. It is designed to encourage and empower the various data owners to share and re-use data permitted by the relevant and applicable legislation and to publish as open data all the data which is not of a sensitive or personal nature.</p><p>The strategy sets out and funds six AI-related pilot projects from six key public sectors domains, i.e. transport, education, health, customer care, tourism and water and energy. Such projects facilitate the path for more intake from the private sector.</p><p>A summary of some of these projects is provided in this section.&#xa0;The Ministry of Tourism is creating an AI-powered platform intended to provide and enhance touristic experience by leveraging valuable insights from a collection of data sources, providing tourists with a personalised experience through the development of rich tourist personas based on demographics, interests and lifestyle choices.&#xa0;The Ministry of Education is working on a pilot project that will develop an AI-powered adaptive learning system to help students achieve better education outcomes through personalised learning programmes based on student performance, ambitions, and needs.&#xa0;Servizz.gov is working on a pilot project to develop a chatbot which will use AI to assist citizens in efficiently obtaining the information that they are seeking.&#xa0;The Ministry for Energy, Enterprise and Sustainable Development is working on a pilot project that is expected help utility companies to maximise resources and subsequently provide responsive real-time customer service management through the use of AI and provide consumers the ability to make real-time adjustments to attain optimised generation efficiency.</p><p>Apart from these six pilot projects, the National AI Strategy funded other initiatives encompassing research projects, scholarship funds and educational/awareness campaigns.&#xa0;</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National ICT Interoperability Framework</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Enterprise Architecture Policy </p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Identity Management System</p><p>The <a href="https://identitymalta.com/services/">National Identity Management System (NIDMS) </a>provides the functionality necessary to consolidate eID Account data and seamlessly associate them with the eID, eRP and ePassport lifecycle.

This policy is based on the ISO27001 Information Security International Standard and is applicable to everyone within the public sector. As part of its Security Governance framework, the MITA started scanning all government websites that utilised its infrastructure for the identification of vulnerabilities and subsequent rectification by the respective owners. A Client Protection Framework was developed to provide business owners with visibility on the security position in the areas for which they are responsible. This was an innovative project which re-designed the way the MITA sought to provide assurance to its clients that the infrastructure on which government data resided was adequately safeguarded from the ever-increasing threats defining today&#x2019;s cyberspace.&#xa0;The MITA heavily invested in cutting-edge technology to provide its clients with the ability to continuously scan for vulnerabilities and obtain real-time visibility on the operational health and security profile of environments hosted on its new Hybrid Cloud Enabling Infrastructure. Information security included three main dimensions: confidentiality, availability and integrity, and involved the application and management of appropriate security measures for a wide range of threats, with the aim of ensuring sustained business success and continuity, and minimising impacts of information security incidents (reference <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/66435.html">ISO/IEC 27000</a>). Additionally, The MITA invested in tools to aid in the detection and prevention of cybersecurity incidents, including adequate training of its employees throughout the organisation, and collaboration with other governmental departments to ensure a centralised and cohesive approach in this domain.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Launch of the National Cybersecurity Awareness and Education Campaign</p><p>On 16 October 2018, the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation, in the presence of the Minister for National Security and Home Affairs, launched the <a href="https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/resource_articles/launch-of-a-national-cyber-security-awareness-and-educational-campaign/">National Cybersecurity Awareness and Education Campaign</a>. As stated, the Campaign, which was one of the key goals of the National Cybersecurity Strategy published in 2016, was based on the government&#x2019;s belief in the need for the entire Maltese society to be fully aware of cyber risks and the security measures to be taken. The Campaign targeted the general public, the private sector as well as the public sector &#x2013; as the largest holder of critical and sensitive information &#x2013; through practical training and promotional initiatives.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Implementation of the NIS Directive </p><p>This legislation aims to improve the national security capability of the country; enhances cross-border collaboration between EU NIS national competent authorities; and upgrades national supervision of critical sectors.

The recommendations aim to support the business needs for the development of the Foundation to match the rapid pace of change led by market needs. The Strategy also aimed to develop a number of measures to support a more evidence-based decision-making process. In addition, the Strategy put forward several specific recommendations to address a number of currently developing market trends identified as part of the fieldwork done over the previous year.</p><p>The targets for these recommendations were measured by discussing the progress by the various stakeholders. A Strategic Consultative Committee (SCC) was set up to measure the progress of the strategy by the various stakeholders. </p><p>The implementation of the National eSkills Strategy 2019&#x2013;2021 has been completed. To review the impact of the Strategy, the Foundation commissioned PWC to carry out an online survey among the academia, SMEs and society, which was followed by a number of interactive workshops with the various stakeholders involved in the strategy. The Survey results were extremely positive and encouraging for future development. The implementation of the National eSkills Strategy has contributed to specific digital transformations needed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Development of Digital Skills in Compulsory Schooling</p><p>The <a href="https://digitalliteracy.skola.edu.mt/">Directorate for Digital Literacy and Transversal Skills (DDLTS)</a>, within the Ministry for Education, identifies gaps in the digital skills of educators and supports them accordingly. The DDLTS coordinates support for educators to make use of various technologies that are available in schools and include them in their lessons in order to engage the students and facilitate learning. Students develop their critical and confident use of technologies and their digital competence. The DDLTS organises many initiatives in education to promote digital literacy, coding and computational thinking (like family coding sessions and the Code Week), internet safety, eTwinning, SELFIE and the implementation of DigComp within compulsory education.</p><p>The <a href="https://education.gov.mt/en/Pages/educ.aspx">Ministry for Education </a>is investing in digital skills in compulsory education curricula through the creation of ICT infrastructures in classrooms. </p><p>In primary schools, digital skills have been strengthened through the One Tablet per Child (OTPC) scheme, where tablets were distributed to all students and educators in year 4, 5 and 6 in all schools. The tablet is aimed to be an educational tool that helps students to enhance learning in literacy, digital literacy, numeracy, science and other areas. Students can learn anytime, anywhere because the tablet facilitates collaboration, communication, creativity, character education, digital citizenship, critical thinking and computational thinking. These competences are pushed forward through the digital learning outcomes, which are aligned with DigComp. The OTPC project aims to increase the skills and competences of students and future graduates; and to ensure that all children will be given a fair and equal opportunity to become familiar with technology. Digital skills are cross-curricular at all compulsory levels and students are expected to use technology across all subjects.</p><p>The Directorate for Learning and Assessment Programmes (DLAP) launched a new ICT programme in middle schools, entitled <a href="https://curriculum.gov.mt/en/syllabi_as_from_sept_2018/Documents/Year_07_08/ICT_syllabus_C3_yr07.pdf">ICT C3</a>, which has been introduced in year 7, to replace ECDL.&#xa0;The new ICT C3 programme goes on until year 11 to ensure that students learn about safety on the net, robotics, coding and other new technologies. This is a compulsory subject in lower and upper secondary education. Computing, VET IT and applied IT are optional subjects which students can study at secondary level.</p><p>With regard to transforming teaching and learning of digital skills in a lifelong learning perspective, including the training of teachers, the DDLTS is mainstreaming the EU&#x2019;s digital competence framework DIGCOMP (JRC, 2017) focusing on digital literacy and 21<sup>st</sup> century skills. The <a href="https://instituteforeducation.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Institute for Education</a> offers a whole range of CDP courses, including courses related to digital competences, in collaboration with the DDLTS. In the framework of the national project One Tablet per Child (OTPC), all educators in year 4, 5 and 6 have to follow the mandatory course &#x2018;Award in the use of tablets in primary classrooms&#x2019;. Professional development is also provided to all teachers involved in the ICT C3 programme, in computing, VET IT and applied IT.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Education at Further and Higher Education Level</p><p>The <a href="https://education.gov.mt/en/Pages/National-Skills-Council.aspx">National Skills Council</a> collaborated with the MCAST on the <a href="https://www.mcast.edu.mt/wp-content/uploads/MCAST-AI-StrategyFinal.pdf">strategy for AI in VET education</a>. The MCAST has launched its AI strategy that includes an update for all the ICT and non-ICT courses to cover relevant content on AI.</p><p>The Institute for Education is currently offering awards in the digital skills area. Anyone who meets the eligibility requirements can attend these courses. Such courses aim to upskill or help educators develop new competences.</p><ul><li>Action research: the Centre engages with academic and professional researchers worldwide and brokers participation in research areas. Strategic alliances are being developed with universities, higher education institutions, consulting firms and the labour market, primarily in the Commonwealth and EU Member States. The Centre will commission action research in strategic and ideally high-profile areas of interest that resonate with target stakeholders. Research findings will be published through peer-reviewed, third-party publications as well as 3CL&#x2011;branded research reports to be published online under the most current version of the Creative Commons Attribution International (CC BY) licence. </li><li>Praxis: the Centre facilitates, develops and shares high-profile pilots that can be replicated as use case studies. This process involves the activation and management of three interconnected pathways: peer-learning networks; connected learning principles and open education resources. Energised forms of digital scaffolding can shift the emphasis from policy discourse to praxis, helping learning institutions, teachers and learners acquire digital skills and learning methods. Providing learning support through the creation of relevant case studies can encourage education institutions to re-evaluate and implement much-needed change in curricula and modes of assessment.</li><li>Advocacy for capacity building: the Centre is an advocate for connected learning and more inclusive approaches to education. In the process it builds capacity as a virtual incubator, integrating skills from different institutions and collaborating on strategic projects with clear &#x2018;needs&#x2019; and &#x2018;wants&#x2019;.</li></ul><p>The strategy is based on seven domains. At the core is the provisioning of data centre facilities which host the government&#x2019;s critical information systems and associated data, and the network infrastructure which provides a backbone for whole government. The second domain relates to information systems where the MITA designs, implements, maintains, and modernises both horizontal digital platforms and solutions, as well as vertical information systems used by the public administration. The third domain focuses on utilising innovative technologies and making the best use of data sharing and linking to facilitate projects such as Once-Only. </p><p>A key domain centres around information security, including the operations of a Security Operations Centre and the setting up of a National Coordination Centre. This domain also comprises Cyber Security activities and awareness programmes targeting different audiences.</p><p>A sixth domain relates to the external environment. The MITA provides various consultancy and project management services and a suite of digital solutions, which are based on its knowledge, competences, platforms, and tools. The Agency establishes strong relationships with various stakeholders, internal and external to the government. Finally, the strategy presents an internal domain; just like any other organisation, the MITA has several internal supporting functions and processes that are integral to its work. </p><p>Supporting the seven domains is the most important asset that the organisation has, its employees. The MITA has excellent resources in different areas and takes measures to motivate, develop and recognise them and to provide an environment where they can deliver.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Justice Strategy (2022&#x2013;2027)</p><p>On 3 December 2021, the Maltese Ministry for Justice and Governance launched its new <a href="https://digitaljustice.gov.mt">Digital Justice Strategy</a> for the years 2022-2027. The strategy seeks to adopt a strategic framework to make further use of the available technologies, respect the rule of law and the substantive and procedural rights of all citizens. This strategy envisages that a more unified and coordinated approach amongst all justice entities will be achieved by the establishment of a set of guiding fundamental principles, which all digital initiatives within the justice sector shall adhere to. The strategy rests on 3 key strategy enablers, namely people, ICTs and processes for the alignment of strategic priorities in order to reach the strategic vision of &#x2018;Improving the quality and the efficiency of justice through innovation, digitalisation and new technology whilst fully respecting the rule of law and guaranteeing the substantial and procedural rights of all citizens.&#x2019; The strategic goals based on Fundamental Justice Principles and strategic principles are:</p><ul><li>Digital by default;</li><li>Access to justice;</li><li>Analytical capabilities; and</li><li>Building digital skills and competencies.</li></ul><p>The strategy will be implemented in the period of 2022&#x2013;2027 and will make use of technological building blocks available nationally and at EU level, amongst others. The action plans for the first 2 years have been designed and are being implemented. Considering the evolving nature of ICTs, action plans will be revised to take stock of the digital landscape at the time. Governance structures and the project management approach have also been setup to oversee the strategy implementation process.</p><p>Digital Tourism Roadmap</p><ul><li>Consolidate and use quality data to improve access to digital information and valuable knowledge that will advance the local product;</li><li>Invest in new technologies to enhance tourist experience through the offer of more customer centric services;</li><li>Nurture digital cross collaboration initiatives across public, private and non-profit organisations to strengthen the tourism sector and provide a holistic experience to visitors;</li><li>Facilitate the smart use of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, supercomputing, 5G network and augmented / virtual realities amongst others, to increase the value of digital tourism products;</li><li>Incentivise innovation to attain a competitive advantage over slower reacting competing destinations; and</li><li>Facilitate the industry to invest in upskilling its staff to address today&#x2019;s demands and technologies.</li></ul><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial intelligence (AI)&#xa0;</h3><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed ledger technologies&#xa0;</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Scholarships on Blockchain and DLTs</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big data&#xa0;</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud computing&#xa0;</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things&#xa0;(IoT)</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Investments in IoT applications</p><ul><li>Develop a registry which provides information on all government sensor and IoT networks</li><li>Identify where DLTs can add enhancements, including decentralised authentication services and digital trust at scale; and</li><li>Develop and prototype applied DLTs within a sensor and IoT network, assess results and propose a strategy for wider roll-out.</li></ul><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance computing&#xa0;</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Compute capacity</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-646.jpeg" alt="35-646.jpeg" class="keepElement"/></p><p>	 Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><p>4</p><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/legalframework/Malta" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2>Specific legislation on digital public administration</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Reuse of Public Sector Information Act</p><p><a href="https://legislation.mt/eli/sl/546.1/mlt">Legal Notice 429</a> was published in 2020, together with the Organisational Structures for Data Sharing and Reuse Regulations, under the Reuse of Public Sector Information Act (Cap. 546).

The agency in charge of the mentioned register is the <a href="https://mbr.mt/">Malta Business Registry</a> which has already started the process of developing a system based on the blockchain using a private hyper-ledger. These developments will help to ensure that information held by the Registrar is up to date, accurate and more secure when compared to traditional ledger systems due to the immutability characteristics of the blockchain system. Having a suitable portal allowing individuals and CSPs to fulfil company law processes electronically ensures also that the latest EU initiatives in relation to company law are incorporated in Maltese company law processes, emanating from the transposition of Directive 2019/1151 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019, amending Directive (EU) 2017/1132 as regards the use of digital tools and processes in company law. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Business Register and Information Sharing Regulations</p><p>These regulations (Subsidiary Legislation 546.02) provide for the establishment and maintenance of a business profile within which businesses may store information relative to their activities and share them with public sector bodies as may be necessary from time to time.

The Directive mandated central government, government entities, local councils and regional authorities able to receive and process invoices electronically. Whilst the central government was mandated to be able to receive and process eInvoices by April 2019, other government entities, local councils and regional authorities were mandated to comply with the Directive by April 2020.</p><p>As part of the process, the <a href="https://mfin.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Ministry for Finance</a> and Employment (MFE) embarked on various local and EU initiatives. An eInvoicing Committee was chaired by the MFE with the participation of the Treasury, the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/">Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) </a>and other local representatives of the central government to oversee the smooth implementation of the Directive for central government, government entities and local councils. For government entities and local councils, the MFIN, together with the <a href="https://economy.gov.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx">Ministry for the Economy and Industry (MEI)</a>, launched a National eInvoicing Forum to promote and implement eInvoicing. At the EU level, Malta participated in the European Multi-Stakeholder Forum on Electronic Invoicing (EMSFEI). </p><p>The European Standard, emanating from the European Directive on electronic invoicing for public authorities (2014/55/EU), defines a semantic data model for a core invoice, compliant with this Directive. The data model of this European Standard contains many optional elements. However, specific countries, groups, or organisations may create individual specifications for the core invoice model, known as Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS), in their respective domains. One of the organisations that created an individual specification for the CIUS is OpenPEPPOL, which created the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0. Following a thorough business impact assessment of the core invoice data model as established by the European Standard, the government of Malta will be adopting the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 as its own CIUS, with no changes. To be able to do this, government decided to become an <a href="https://peppol.eu/about-openpeppol/">OpenPEPPOL</a> end-user member.</p><p>The adoption of the PEPPOL CIUS guaranteed a high degree of interoperability since several Member States adopted this CIUS or based their local CIUS on the PEPPOL model. It means that the government will incorporate the PEPPOL CIUS in its systems and will be able to receive eInvoices through the PEPPOL eDelivery network. Joining OpenPEPPOL was an important part of Malta&#x2019;s strategy to support compliance with the European eInvoicing Directive (2014/55/EU), making it easier for businesses to engage with the government online. </p><p>The Maltese government promoted the adoption of eInvoicing in its <a href="https://digitalmalta.org.mt/en/Documents/Digital Malta 2014 - 2020.pdf">Digital Malta National Strategy 2014&#x2013;2020</a>. There is currently no eInvoicing platform in place in Malta. The <a href="https://treasury.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury Department</a> within the Ministry for Finance and Employment (MFE) is working on implementing a new Corporate Financial Management Solution (CFMS) across the central government, alongside an eInvoicing PEPPOL-compliant platform linking suppliers to the solution.

It acts as the main entry point to data discovery and consumption for all official registers. It is designed to be the one-stop-shop for all data discovery and meta-data management matters, thus requiring that all meta-data for all registers be made available through the Register of Registers and other Data Governance registers. It has two main sections, namely (i) the Open Data Portal; and (ii) the Internal Data Sharing services.</p><p>The National Data Portal is also expected to serve as a link with the European Data Portal for harvesting of local datasets, including those related to open data for publication on a European scale. Any data generated through taxpayer&#x2019;s contribution and classified as Open Data should be made available for re-use by any person or organisation without any barriers or other obstacles, following the 5-star deployment scheme for open data. Indeed, where possible, the portal displays the contents of official registers which are classified as open data. However, when such data are not readily available, a facility within the portal is needed to submit online formal requests. Such requests for open data would need to follow a legally determined process, having various stages of redress in cases of refusal. </p><p>On the other hand, the National Data Portal also caters for the official registers which contain certain sensitive or personal information, and therefore cannot be published as open data. These data are therefore only available to predefined specific roles where the appropriate authentication and authorisation is required in order to gain access. Consequently, the portal also facilitates sharing and re-using such public administration data across authorised entities, as required by their functions. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Intranet for the Public Service</p><p>The MITA offers a <a href="http://intra.gov.mt/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="collaborative platform" resource="http://intra.gov.mt/">collaborative platform</a> which is also based on Microsoft SharePoint, for document management, collaboration and intranets.

The advantage to the public is that they have access to all eServices related to the courts of justice from one website that is mobile responsive. The advantage to legal practitioners and citizens is that they can access additional services through their eID that are not available to the general public without having to go physically to the courts. Services that are available to the public include civil cases, judgements, the insolvency register, judicial sales, hall usage, mobile notifications, payment of court fines and court registry fees. Other services that are available to the citizen are: Archive of Acts, My Cases and My Acts and those available to legal practitioners include: online submission of acts, searching of acts, warrants, civil forms and the interdiction and incapacitation register. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Legislation Portal</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Notarial Acts Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.notarialacts.gov.mt" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="notarial acts portal" resource="http://www.notarialacts.gov.mt">Notarial Acts Portal</a> provides the ability for the general public and notaries to procure public deeds online from the comfort of their home.

This new responsive website replaced the previous legacy recruitment portal, which was later decommissioned following an extensive backup process. A mobile app titled Join the Public Service, which is connected to the new recruitment portal, was launched in mid-2018. Its aim was to alert the general public about job opportunities related to areas of their interest within the public administration. </p><p>Business Portal</p><p>The Business Portal is earmarked to change the current one-stop-shop concept, whereby businesses will get to access multiple services from a single online interface. Thus, all the requirements associated with starting, running and closing a business would be addressed through a single interactive intelligent portal that would automatically and seamlessly submit data to the various stakeholders and deliver services online in a timely manner. </p><p>By following the Once-Only principle, the Portal will ensure that data and information provided to government entities are consistent and accurate and the duplication of data is avoided. In addition, through the use of modern technologies, the portal will enhance user experience whilst utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) practices such as the clustering business behaviour and predictive analytics, identify future business and functional requirements, and request and provide targeted information on the regulatory framework or recommend services and incentives relevant to the particular end-user.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Subnational portals </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Local Government Portal</p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Next Generation Access</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">MAGNET</p><p>MAGNET was implemented in 1995 as the MAlta Government NETwork that connects all government ministries, departments and agencies, as well as local councils, police stations, libraries, hospitals, health centres, social services offices and embassies. This network enabled the government to disseminate IT and information society applications such as email, the internet, and corporate applications like the Common Database (CdB) and the Departmental Accounting System (DAS) to help facilitate and improve the efficiency of the public service. The availability of this network enabled the government to launch its eGovernment services. A new network, &#x201c;MAGNET II&#x201d;, was launched in July 2005 and partly replaced MAGNET. This new state&#x2011;of-the-art network presented a number of benefits for users compared to its predecessor. In particular, MAGNET II provided enhanced bandwidth per site, offered better reliability through strict service level agreements (SLAs), guaranteed 99.8% minimum site availability and was fully secure through extensive encryption.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Core Network Upgrade</p><p>The <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="mita" resource="https://mita.gov.mt/">MITA</a> core network infrastructure located at the MITA&#x2019;s two Data Centres and interlinking them together, is the junction through which all network traffic originating from any government site is transported through MAGNET, to its intended recipient. The core network infrastructure is a fundamental building block on which the MITA can provide a wide variety of government services, thanks to its robustness, high availability, high speed, high capacity and security measures.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Maltese Government Common Database</p><p>The Maltese Government Common Database (CdB) was enhanced with some minor amendments.

Work is under way with the European Commission to provide SDG core services on a staging environment to commence integration to the core services.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Identity Management System </p><p>The existing <a href="https://identitymalta.com/id-cards/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="national identity management system (nidms)" resource="https://identitymalta.com/id-cards/">National Identity Management System (NIDMS)</a> aims to support <strong>core identity management</strong> <strong>processes,</strong> including the issuance of electronic identity cards (eID Card), ePassports, biometric visas and residence documents. The government operates a number of identity management systems, the most important of which are: core database systems, electronic identity (eID) infrastructure, an electoral system, a national identity card system and the passport system. However, it should be noted that these and other disparate information systems are not entirely interoperable.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Identity</p><p>To keep the eID solution secure, robust and stable for eGovernment service continuity, the MITA approved in 2014 a technology upgrade for the solution that included a migration to a newer and fully supported hosting platform, and an alignment of the software development platform to recent versions. The technology upgrade included the first phase of simplification of the authentication mechanism through the introduction of a new single sign-on screen for a harmonised user experience and additional security. In parallel, several high-level consultations were held to discuss the potential successive phases of simplification.</p><p>The technology<strong> </strong>upgrade for the eID solution was completed in 2016. The migration to the new environment resulted in a noticeable improvement in performance and stability and was achieved with no disruption to the subscribers and the relying parties. The new single sign-on screen was also launched, following a complete re-engineering of the user interface and functionality to achieve the desired simplification. This simplification in the user experience was accompanied by a complete overhaul of the registration and activation processes where the reliance on the PIN letter was removed in favour an electronic activation process. Several eGovernment services, notably servizz.gov, eForms, myHealth, taxation, Automated Revenue Management Services (ARMS) and social security have since lined up to integrate with the new screen to achieve the desired outcomes.</p><p>In 2017, the MITA completed the final phase of the simplification of the eID authentication mechanism, which envisaged an alignment of the assurance levels to achieve a basic assurance level using the eID account and password, and a high assurance level using the ID card and PIN. This provided a better choice of usability or security for subscribers and relying parties. The basic assurance level was intended to have a password with reduced mandatory complexity with an optional one-time password. The high assurance level potentially involved additional usability challenges in view of the initial set up and installation of the ID card, but still provided the additional security required.</p><p>In 2019, an optional two-factor authentication mechanism for eID based on a time-based one-time password (TOTP) mechanism was introduced, intended for specific eGovernment services which require a substantial level of assurance. Support for the OpenID Connect Protocol to facilitate better access from native mobile applications was also introduced. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Identity Cards (eID Card)</p><p>The eID Card is an identity card which, in addition to the traditional identification features, also includes an electronic component which allows citizens to access an array of electronic services provided by the government and other third parties.</p><p>Maltese nationals who are 14 years of age and older are entitled to an eID Card. The card&#x2019;s electronic features are available to all card holders with one exception: the signature certificate is only available to citizens aged 18 years and older.</p><p>The electronic chip of the eID card holds the same biographic data that are visible on the face of the card, including a digital image of the citizen. The chip includes two digital certificates for authentication and signatures, and applications for ticketing and electronic purse.</p><p>The digital certificate for authentication enables the citizen to log in securely to eGovernment services. The digital certificate for signatures is an enabler for electronic signatures. These are qualified certificates under the eCommerce Act and the electronic signature will be equivalent to a hand-written signature. Both certificates are protected by different Personal Identification Numbers (PINs).</p><p>The eID Card can be used by citizens to securely access their health information through eGovernment services but does not hold any sensitive health data. An eID account is required to access health information through the myHealth Portal. No fingerprint biometric data is held on the eID Card, which does not replace the voting document issued by the Electoral Commission, either.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ePassports</p><p>Passports issued as from the 1 October 2008 are all ePassports. These first generations of electronic passports had a BAC (Basic Access Control) chip. The biometrics captured were a photo image and a signature. As from 1 July 2010, the ePassports&#x2019; chip was upgraded to EAC (Extended Access Control). Fingerprints were added to the biometrics captured.</p><p>On 30 March 2015, the ePassports&#x2019; chip was upgraded to SAC (Supplemental Access Control). However, the same biometrics were captured as the chip is the latest third generation to date.</p><p>The main reasons that led to the introduction of an ePassport were to:</p><ul><li>Prevent fight passport fraud;</li><li>Reduce passport forgery;</li><li>Facilitate more robust border controls; and</li><li>Establish a link with the lawful owner.</li></ul><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Public Procurement System Platform</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Department of Contracts Portal</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">MITA Procurement Website</p><p>The MITA, the other Central Purchasing Body besides the DoC, maintains a <a href="mailto:https://procurement.mita.gov.mt/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="procurement-dedicated website" resource="mailto:https://procurement.mita.gov.mt/">procurement-dedicated website</a> that allows greater interaction on its public calls for tenders through a mobile responsive design.

These initiatives will be used as a vehicle to develop proof of concepts and promote the further take-up of emerging technologies. Where applicable, the MITA will make resources available through the Emerging Technologies Lab to provide projects with the necessary backing. The aim is to increase the use of technology for the benefit of citizens and businesses. Since the technology would not have been applied in such a way before, developing the proof of concept will be the first step to take the project forward for actual implementation. The knowledge gained will be used as input for the justification of the project or the adoption of alternative methods. Independent from the decision on whether to proceed with project implementation, the knowledge gained by the MITA, public administration, and partners can be used to solve other similar problems.
