The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Romania in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Romania&#x2019;s results in Scoreboard 1 show a medium implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring at the European average for various Principles, including Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), Principle 3 (Transparency) and Principle 11 (Preservation of information). Moreover, Romania progressed on the implementation of some principles compared to 2021. For instance, the country has now an upper-medium performance in Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility) as well as Principle 10. Nonetheless, Romania could further work on the implementation of several recommendations with low performance score. In this regard, Romania could undertake additional steps in ensuring a level playing field for open-source software and demonstrating active and fair consideration of using open-source software (Recommendation 3) as well as defining a common security and privacy framework and establishing processes for public services to ensure secure and trustworthy data exchange between public administrations and in interactions with citizens and businesses (Recommendation 15). </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Romanian results for the implementation of interoperability layers shows a medium-low performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. However, as in the case of Scoreboard 1, Romania shows progress in the implementation of the recommendations compared to 2021. Particularly, the country scores as good as the EU average in the organisational interoperability layer. Romanian performance improved also with regard to the legal interoperability, but country has still a Lower-medium performance. Potential areas of improvement entail keep working in ensuring interoperability and coordination over time when operating and delivering integrated public services (Integrated Public Service Governance &#x2013; Recommendation 25) as well as using open specifications, where available, to ensure technical interoperability when establishing European public services (Technical Interoperability &#x2013; Recommendation 33). </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Romania&#x2019;s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 shows a medium performance, matching at the EU average for the recommendations related to external information sources and services as well as security and privacy. Nevertheless, areas of improvement concern the implementation of recommendations related to Internal information sources and services and Catalogues, having both a lower performance. In fact, Romania could further work on the development of a shared infrastructure of reusable services and information sources that can be used by all public administrations (Recommendation 36) and on the setup of catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions while using common models for describing them (Recommendation 44).</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p property="dbo:areaTotal" content="The results of Romania concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an overall medium-low level of implementation of the associated recommendations.

The problem underlying public policy in the field of eGovernment in Romania is the insufficient development of public eServices, an issue that is evident when taking a look at the small number of electronic public services made available to the public that go beyond level-2 digital sophistication (one-way interaction with citizens, e.g. downloading electronic forms). An eRomania public policy was thus urgently needed. </p><p>The policy revolves around 36 life events, representing a series of important public services in the lives of citizens and legal entities. The following four objectives were identified:</p><ul><li>General objective: increase the number and quality of electronic public services in Romania;</li><li>Objective 1: develop life-event related public eServices for citizens and businesses by the end of 2030 reaching at minimum level-4 digital sophistication (where appropriate);</li><li>Objective 2: strengthen the capacity of public institutions and authorities to operate in an advanced digital environment and provide mature public eServices by the end of 2030; and</li><li>Objective 3: strengthen the overall digital competence of public administration employees, and increase the motivation and specialisation levels of public administration information technology (IT) staff continuously, as appropriate, by the end of 2030.</li></ul><p>In order to achieve the above-mentioned objectives, 14 specific strategic and complementary measures were defined, representing fundamental decisions acting in synergy to build an effective and sustainable change programme.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Approval of the Romanian Interoperability Framework </p><p>The approval of the Romanian Interoperability Framework (RIF), in December 2017, set out the goal to guide, promote and support the delivery of Romanian public services by fostering cross-border, cross-organizational and cross-sector interoperability.

In this regard, administrative simplification entails the development of the national infrastructure of administrative registers, the creation and administration of unique identifiers, the implementation of standardized ICT architectures and the expansion of the interoperability between them, systematizing and simplifying data flows, queries and reporting procedures. The chapter Digital Public Administration under the section Development of e-government services outlines the implementation of the Once-Only principle and interoperability architecture based on a management of APIs made available by all public institutions that hold national data registries. This approach will pursue the identification of all basic registers and the creation of a mechanism for amending this list, ensuring the technical infrastructure to access basic registers to be quick, secure and flexible, thus ensuring data integrity, availability and confidentiality. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-998.png" alt="A picture containing night sky
