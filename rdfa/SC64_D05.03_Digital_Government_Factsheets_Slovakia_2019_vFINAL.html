At the national level, it accelerated ongoing processes in terms of building the digital market and carrying out various measures that arose from the most recent cross-sectoral policies of the EU. The Strategy also reflects on the strategic materials and recommendations of international organisations (EU, OECD, UN, G7 and G20) that consider digital transformation to be the key to inclusive and sustainable growth. The Strategy puts emphasis on new digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, 5G technology, big data and analytical processing of data, blockchain or high-performance computers, which will eventually become a new engine of economic growth and competitiveness.</p><p>The Action Plan of Digital Transformation 2019-2022, which summarised short-term priorities and measures, was developed to follow the Strategy. Its specific measures were divided into three subject areas: </p><ul><li>Improvement of education with a focus on digital skills and employment for the modern era;</li><li>Strengthening of pillars for a modern digital economy; and</li><li>Ability of the public sector to use innovations and data. </li></ul><p>The vision of digital transformation, however, is more complex, covering the economy, society, public services, rural development, science and research.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Concept of eGovernment 2015 - 2020</p><p>The <a href="http://www.informatizacia.sk/narodna-koncepcia-informatizacie-verejnej-spravy--2016-/22662c">National Concept of eGovernment</a>, approved by the Slovak government in September 2016, defined the strategic Enterprise Architecture of eGovernment and its central coordination, and also the principles and objectives of further development in accordance with goals stated in the Strategic Document for Digital Growth and Next Generation Access Infrastructure. This document represented a new philosophy of viewing informatisation with an emphasis on the process openness, fair competition, and increase of the value of IT in key functions of public administration, whether in a form of the improved services, better decisions thanks to data, better regulation, or more efficient operation. The concept was built around a vision of an innovative and open state that provides the citizens and businesses with user-friendly and easy-to-use services, but at the same time operated in a complex way so that it could respond swiftly and effectively to the challenges of the dynamic modern era. </p><p>Informatisation priorities covering a wide range of areas needed to be addressed. The priority of process optimisation and automation of the public administration performance, along with the priority of orchestration of services to the life situations, ensured a qualitative change not only in the provision of the public administration services to the public, but also in the operation of public administration itself. Equally important were priorities referring to improved access for citizens, businesses and officials to the e-Government environment, the use of the common central blocks, management of data, Open Data, Government Cloud, and security. This document also included a proposal to prioritise development programmes and projects that helped implement the strategic architecture of public administration, reference architecture of specific solutions, and segment architecture. These aspects created conditions for the efficient process of public administration informatisation. They managed and controlled access by the Slovak Government to any changes in the process, as well as preconditions for offering effective responses to a wide range of existing and potential economic, security or other threats.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Operational Programme Integrated Infrastructure 2014-2020</p><p>The <a href="http://www.telecom.gov.sk/index/open_file.php?file=doprava/dopinfra/program/Dokumenty/fondyeu20142020/SchvaleneOPII/OP_Integrovana_infrastruktura.pdf">Operational Programme Integrated Infrastructure</a> (OPII) was a strategic document developed for the absorption of EU funds in the transport sector and in the area of enhancing access to, and use and quality of, information technologies.
