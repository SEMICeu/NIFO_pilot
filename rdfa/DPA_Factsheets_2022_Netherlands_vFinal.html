The public solution for citizens (DigiD) is reserved for G2C authentications. The policy aims at strengthening DigiD in two ways: on the one hand by introducing new certificates on ID cards and driving licences to have a higher level of trust, and on the other hand by accepting private authentication solutions under strict conditions in order to promote resilience. </p><p>DigiD enables individuals to identify themselves for digital services. DigiD offers security: you know who you are dealing with. Using DigiD, the Citizen Service Number (BSN) of the person logging in is disclosed. This makes it possible to check the information already on file for that individual and offer personalised services. At this moment, logging in involves a user name and a password, and in some cases a text message for further verification. In July 2017 the <a href="https://www.digid.nl/over-digid/app/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="digid app" resource="https://www.digid.nl/over-digid/app/">DigiD App</a> was launched. </p><p>DigiD is available at three levels: </p><ul><li>Basic (user name and password: DigiD); </li><li>Medium (DigiD + sms-authentication or using the <a href="https://www.digid.nl/over-digid/app/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="digid app" resource="https://www.digid.nl/over-digid/app/">DigiD app</a>), which both represent a stork QAA level 2; and</li><li>Substantial (the DigiD app upgraded with an ID verification), stork QAA level 3.</li></ul><p>Although it is not mandatory by law yet, DigiD has become the main authentication system for citizens.
