The PAR aims to solve horizontal and sectoral issues. In relation to the horizontal/cross-cutting issues, the reform of human resource management (HRM) across the public sector is planned. More specifically, the government submitted a set of legislative proposals to the House of Representatives, aiming at the introduction of a new performance appraisal system, the improvement of promotion procedures, Public Service Commission governance and mobility enhancement.</p><p>With regards to sectoral issues, functional reviews were completed within the civil services domain (Ministries and Constitutional/Independent Services) aimed at the reorganisation of structures within the various ministries and independent authorities, and generally the provision of better services to businesses and citizens. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Action Plan on Better Regulation</p><p>The third and final progress report for the Action Plan on Better Regulation that covered the period from 2015 to 2018 was submitted to the Ministerial Council in late 2019.

The plan consists of three priority axes:</p><ul><li>Simplification of procedures and legislation and reduction of the administrative burden;</li><li>Better law-making and impact assessment (IA) of new legislation; and </li><li>Embedding the culture and enhancing relevant skills in relation to the Action Plan on Better Regulation.</li></ul><p>The IA mechanism, put in place in 2017 to undertake more focused and thorough IAs for new legislation, was embedded and is now a mandatory part of the legal drafting procedure. An IA report summarising the main findings and suggestions for the way forward was published in 2018. Its intention was to continue the training programme of government officials and further enhance the implementation of the new IA framework.</p><p>Further to the above three axes, the action plan also included actions that are being promoted under the pillar of eGovernment, which go hand in hand with the other Better Regulation initiatives.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Partnership Agreement </p><p>ICT is among the selected sectors for investment, with the main aim being the promotion of the use of ICT in the public and private sectors to improve the competitiveness of the economy. The implementation of the PA is further specified in the Operational Programmes (OP), which are determined according to the type of each ESI fund.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Operational Programme &#x2018;Competitiveness and Sustainable Development&#x2019; </p><p>The promotion of ICT use is one of the seven priority axes of the 2014&#x2013;2020 OP &#x2018;<a href="http://www.dgepcd.gov.cy/dgepcd/dgepcd.nsf/page09_en/page09_en?OpenDocument">Competitiveness and Sustainable Development&#x2019;</a>. The budget of the axis is around EUR 40 million (6% of the OP&#x2019;s total budget), which is co-financed by the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF) with EUR 33.5 million. Around 85% of this budget was allocated to strengthening ICT applications for eGovernment, eLearning and eHealth. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Recovery and Resilience Facility</p><p>The <a href="http://www.cyprus-tomorrow.gov.cy">Recovery and Resilience Facility</a> (thereafter called the Facility) is the centrepiece of &#x2018;<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/recovery-plan-europe/pillars-next-generation-eu_en">Next Generation EU</a>&#x2019;, a temporary recovery instrument that allows the Commission to raise funds to help repair the immediate economic and social damage brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The Facility is also closely aligned with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024_en">Commission&#x2019;s priorities</a>, ensuring a sustainable and inclusive recovery in the long-term that promotes the green and digital transitions. The Facility will provide EUR 672.5 billion in loans and grants available to support reforms and investments undertaken by the Member States.</p><p>Each Member State should prepare a Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP), which will include its reforms and investments for the years 2021&#x2013;2023, with a horizon of implementation by 2026. </p><p>The proposed projects fall under the following policy domains:</p><p>1. Upgrade Infrastructure for Connectivity (EUR 53 million):</p><p>Ensuring 5G and fibre coverage for 100% of the population living in organized communities, including deployment of 5G along the main terrestrial corridors, and enabling universal and affordable access to Gigabit connectivity in all urban and rural areas, including 5G and Gigabit connectivity, in line with the EU 2025 5G and Gigabit connectivity objectives. Additionally, a high level of broadband connectivity is key for digital services to be practical, accessible and, of course, affordable; the aim is to facilitate high-speed connectivity, as well as proceed with the deployment of 5G networks within 2021. The main objective of this component is to bridge divides and ensure an inclusive digital transformation. Ensuring adequate access to communication infrastructures for all citizens is essential for the realization of the opportunities of digital transformation. To ensure an inclusive digital transformation, it is necessary to bridge the gaps, so that opportunities can be harnessed by everyone.</p><p>2. Promote e-Government (EUR 46 million):</p><p>eGovernment projects are developed through a 2-tier approach, more specifically through the rapid deployment of small-scale digital solutions (microservices) and the parallel long-term implementation of mega e-government projects. There is a holistic approach encompassing all governmental authorities. The ultimate goal is to create an end-to-end high-quality experience for citizens and businesses throughout their interactions and &#x2018;touch-points&#x2019; with the public sector, drive cost efficiencies, enhance reliability, security and resilience, and draw genuine trust in the system and the technologies themselves. Flagship projects of this domain include the Digital Services Factory, the implementation of government Cloud-G Cloud, the digital transformation of Courts, the modernization of customs and electronic payment system, the integrated information system for the Registrar of Companies and Official Receiver.</p><p>3. Smart Cities (EUR 35 million):</p><p>The DMRID has been appointed to take the leading and coordinating role in developing a nation-wide strategy on Smart Cities, orchestrating, through a well-crafted plan, the Smart-cities framework, as well as all supporting initiatives and smart-cities building blocks. The key objective is to manage the existing on-going initiatives and include them in a nationwide plan, enhanced and complemented with additional initiatives, implementation plan, governance and steering mechanisms that can transform the quality of life and citizen experience, optimise cities&#x2019; use of resources and services, and lead to operational efficiencies and revenue maximization.</p><p>4. Digital Skills (EUR 2 million):</p><p>This initiative has been specifically designed and formulated for the enhancement of digital skills across all population groups (public administration, enterprises and society at large) as well as the promotion of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and professional paths, so as to effectively address the market shortage in ICT professionals.</p><p>Notably, the DMRID has a horizontal and vertical role in the utilization and successful implementation of the RRP, in that it will operate both as the implementation body for its own projects and as a monitoring body for projects of digital nature implemented by other public and wider public organizations/agencies. </p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Scheme</p><p>In February 2019, the eGovernment Board made a new decision regarding the adoption of eIdentification: the government will prepare a national scheme on eIdentification and eSignature by changing relevant legislations.

The SMS is a crucial element of the restructuring plan of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport and Youth, which aims to create an advanced computerised system that will ensure proper information management and process automation. The SMS will contribute to the streamlining of bureaucracy, the reduction of high administrative costs and it will ensure the prompt provision of information, cooperation and support of various stakeholders. The different services offered by the SMS will be gradually introduced until the expected ending date of the project in 2023. The total cost for the implementation of the system is around EUR 10 million, which will be co-financed by both national resources and the ERDF 2021&#x2013;2027. </p><p>In support of the project, this year, a number of tablets were delivered to all upper secondary schools, in order to prepare, empower and develop the digital skills of the educators for the application of the SMS. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Coalition for Digital Jobs</p><p>Interventions addressed to the public sector aim to eliminate one of its main deficiencies, i.e. the lack of specialised skillsets and experience to support digital transformation, both in terms of designing and implementing eGovernment and other digital projects, and of using the new information technology (IT) systems/processes/digital services etc. </p><p>Upskilling is about anticipating the right skills for the future, laying the cultural foundation, delivering modern programmes, and building a learning and development culture within enterprises. It includes upskilling and reskilling programmes, from basic to advanced level, for graduates, professionals, and unemployed, aimed at bridging the digital divide, covering industry needs, improving employability opportunities, increasing the country&#x2019;s competitive edge as a hub for sciences, tech and startup companies, and promoting growth and innovation activities. </p><p>Actions addressed to the enhancement of the digital skills of the general population include remote areas, vulnerable groups such as the elderly and people with disabilities, so as to ensure inclusiveness and equal opportunities. </p><ul><li><strong>to ensure the roll-out and take-up of broadband for all, at increasing speeds, through fixed and wireless technology; </strong></li><li><strong>to promote competition in electronic communications and reduce prices of broadband services and products; </strong></li><li><strong>to connect the whole of Cyprus with high and ultra-high-speed networks; </strong></li><li><strong>to address cyber threats and generally strengthen security in the digital networks; and</strong></li><li><strong>to enhance the international sub-marine cable network, connecting Cyprus to Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</strong> </li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Reform of the Justice System</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Strategy on Decentralised Technologies and Blockchain</p><ul><li>Priority 1 - preparing an enabling legislative framework;</li><li>Priority 2 - enhancing the application of the technology by the government and the private sector; and</li><li>Priority 3 - promoting DLT in the financial sector.</li></ul><p>Priority 1<strong>:</strong> The new legislation on DLT and blockchain is under preparation and is expected to be concluded by the end of the year.

The national legislation will be available well ahead of the European Regulation, which will act as complementary to the national legislation for possible unregulated crypto-assets. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">European Blockchain Partnership and MED 7 Cooperation</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence</p><p>In May 2021, an updated national strategy was introduced and a specific action plan was prepared, with a timeframe of implementation until 2026.</p><p>Human Capital: concerning improvements to the <strong>education in AI</strong>, the policy report mentions, among others, the creation and upgrade of higher-education programs in AI, the development of reskilling and upskilling opportunities for the labour force and an overall deepening of societal knowledge on the use and application of AI technologies.</p><p>From the Lab to the Market: the Cypriot Government devotes particular attention to policy actions fostering research and innovation, including the creation of a <strong>Centre of Excellence for Applied Research in AI</strong>, and the introduction of new financial support and funding schemes.

On a national level, the key point is the creation of a Central Citizen Data Warehouse, which uniquely links every citizen to the Central eGovernment Portal, the country&#x2019;s cloud-based electronic health record system (EHR). It would not be difficult to accommodate into this system any non-Cypriot citizens who choose to obtain a user account and store their data on Cyprus&#x2019; cloud upon payment of an annual fee.

The TFA Portal will empower taxpayers with a user-friendly self-service system, which will allow them to self-manage online their obligations, as well as other day-to-day interactions with the department involving for example certificates and reports. The contract cost (including operation and maintenance) amounts to EUR 24.5 million and the implementation of the system is expected to be completed in November 2023. The implementation of the TFA plan is divided in three stages:</p><ul><li>Stage one: the Value-Added-Tax and the TFA Portal will be implemented in stage one, and the TFA will include functionalities with regard to registrations, returns, assessments, payments, reporting, refunds, certificates, revenue accounting, taxpayer accounting, complaints, and enquiries;</li><li>Stage two: Pay as You Earn (PAYE), the Corporate Income Tax and other non-individual taxes will be implemented in stage two and the TFA will include additional functionalities with regard to online registrations, audits, debt management, objections and appeals and stamp duties;</li><li>Stage three: the Personal Income Tax (PIT) and other taxes for individuals will be implemented in stage three and the TFA will include additional functionalities with regard to risk analyses, legal proceedings, tax rulings, discounts, special schemes, and tax types management. </li></ul><p>The Risk Analysis Tool relies largely on data from the information system ERGANI, where, among others, all employees and their working hours are declared by the employers. As foreseen in the design of the system, the data from the information system ERGANI are linked to, and cross-checked with, the data from the Social Insurance System, through interoperability connection. Thus, more inconsistencies are likely to be found and addressed. In the near future, there are also plans to link the system to other authorities&#x2019; databases. The system is expected to be a powerful tool for preventing undeclared working, conducting targeted inspections and guaranteeing close monitoring of high-risk companies in specific sectors as well as seasonal activities. The system is expected to be up and running in 2021.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Subnational Portals</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date. </p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Data Network and Government Internet Node</p><p>The <strong>Government Data Network</strong> (GDN) interconnects all government information systems and organisations.
