The platform offers three basic groups of services: Infrastructure as a service, Platform as a service and Software as a service.

The introduction of a centralised IoT integration platform would enable the central collection and sharing of large amounts of data from various sensors, and make all necessary tools available to the public and private sectors. The platform would be able to host applications whose function is to process and share available data in real time.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Development Strategy 2030</p><p>In the National Development Strategy 2030, under the strategic goal &#x2018;Digital Transition of Society and Economy&#x2019;, investments in the State information infrastructure will continue in order to facilitate the development of new business models based on digital technologies by introducing interoperable solutions. The proposed reform called Improving the Interoperability of Information Systems, under the NPRR, will focus on the establishment of a central interoperability system, and the interoperability of public registers and information systems as well as the implementation of a central data warehouse and a platform for the exchange of IoT data.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Shared Services Centre</p><p>Under the project aimed at the establishment of a <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/uspostava-centra-dijeljenih-usluga/1596">Shared Services Centre</a>, a central interoperability platform was introduced. Currently, about ten registers are integrated in the Government Service Bus (GSB) with a view to developing eServices. The GSB is the technical solution that was established in the Shared Services Centre, that represents the component of the Central Interoperability System. The GSB provides the functionality of securely receiving, forwarding, recording, encrypting and validating messages and documents between individual public sector bodies. </p><p>The available eServices include the eEnrolment and eRenovation services. The eEnrolment service is available in educational institutions. The process of integrating public registers in the GSB started precisely to develop a complex eService of electronic registration and enrolment in educational institutions. This project envisages the integration of eight registers (veterans&apos; register, birth register, residence register, etc.) through the GSB. The process includes the publication of the application service (application programming interface or API) on the GSB and the use of this application service in order to retrieve data from public registers.</p><p>The second eService that is important in this context is eRenovation, i.e. a digital system that enables the submission of requests for renewal attaching all necessary documentation, monitors the implementation of the renewal procedure, displays renewal data on the Geoportal and provides reports according to various criteria. The following principles have been applied in the development of the system: (i) minimize the amount of data required from applicants; (ii) create a link to the records of other public authorities for the purpose of data exchange; (iii) do not search for data already existing in the records of other public authorities; (iv) introduce changes, if necessary, in source systems (registers); (v) promote a process approach to developing the required functionalities with the aim of maximally reducing  points with the possibility of making discretionary decisions; (vi) communicate in an electronic way, that is faster, easier, cheaper and more precise than paper; and (vii) aim to ensure that the user always selects from a set of known values, i.e. to minimize the possibility of free entry.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Data Policy</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p>The coordinator of the ePIC project is FINA and project partners are the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of the Sea, Transport and Infrastructure, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Construction and Physical Planning, and the Official Gazette.

This new eService offers the possibility for one parent, EU/EEA citizen, to give his/her consent to the other parent to complete the process of issuing ID documents (ID card or passport) for their child or to change the child&#x2019;s address of permanent residence. eServices also offer the possibility for EU/EEA citizens, who are owners or part-owners of real estate on the territory of the Republic of Croatia, to give their consent to another adult person for registration of permanent residence at the address of that real estate property. These eServices require a high-level electronic identity credential;</li><li><strong>eNautics</strong> &#x2013; This service enables online notification of the arrival of foreign vessels or Croatian boats in Croatian territorial waters, with a view to paying the safety or navigation fees, and the download of the electronic receipt as proof of payment;</li><li><strong>eSeafarer</strong> &#x2013; This service enables submission of applications for boat skipper exams.

Students thus actively participate in teaching with increased motivation to learn and continue their education, and thus become more competitive in the labour market. The management of eSchools is efficient and transparent, and communication and exchange of eDocuments between the school, its stakeholders and founders are much simpler.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Statement on Cooperation for Artificial Intelligence</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-795.jpeg" alt="A gavel on a desk

In other words, the eFee system is one of the common horizontal components that enables the electronic payment of administrative fees and charges, and, depending on the legal prerequisites, the payment of other types of fees (court, notary, tourist and others). The project also enables card payment of administrative fees and charges for the services of central State administration bodies provided by the State Administration Offices. </p><p>The end user is enabled to pay the total price of the service in one payment, which will be distributed through the system to the parts and entities to which it belongs according to the applicable regulations. The eFee system increases the availability and billing of public services, and improves their management. At the same time, the gradual replacement of classic markers is achieved and their use is minimised.</p><p>The overall goal is to improve the communication of public administration with users - individuals and legal entities - by fully computerising business processes. To that end, it is necessary to enable the integration of the eFee system with electronic services available through the eCitizen and eBusiness systems, i.e. with the information systems of public administration bodies that enable the provision of electronic services to citizens and business entities. The establishment of this system will facilitate the further application and development of the eCitizen and eBusiness platforms.
