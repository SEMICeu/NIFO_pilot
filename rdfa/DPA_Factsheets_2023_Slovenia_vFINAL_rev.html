The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Slovenia in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Slovenia&#x2019;s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF principles. Slovenia meets the European average for every principle, except for Principle 3 (Transparency) which obtains a score of 3 and for Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility), which are below the European average with a respective score of 3 and 2. Regarding Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency), implementation of the recommendations improved the score by 2 to 3. The areas of improvement for Slovenian public administrations are as follows: firstly, enhance internal visibility and to provide external interfaces for European public services by enhancing the online availability and accessibility of the administrative procedures (Recommendation 05). Second, to ensure that all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Recommendation 14).</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Slovenian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance. Slovenia reaches a maximum score of 4, in line with the European average, for all interoperability layers. To maintain this high performance, a potential area of improvement could be to enhance the implementation of two recommendations linked to interoperability governance and Integrated public service governance. Recommendation 23 addresses the consultation of relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level, in accordance with your NIF and relevant DIFs, when procuring and developing ICT solutions. Recommendation 25 is aimed at guaranteeing interoperability and coordination over time when operating and delivering integrated public services by putting in place the necessary governance structure.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Slovenia&#x2019;s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of most recommendations. In line with the European average, Slovenia gets a maximal score of 4 for all. Slightly above the European average, Slovenia obtains a maximal score of 4 for external information sources and services, for security and privacy and for catalogues. Potential areas of improvement could be to match each base registry with appropriate metadata including the description of its content, service assurance and responsibilities, the type of master data it keeps, conditions of access and the relevant licences, terminology, a glossary, and information about any master data it uses from other base registries (Base Registries - Recommendation 39).</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Slovenia concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an overall good performance of the country in 16 indicators. However, Slovenia has still margin for improvement. Principle 7, 10 and Base Registries are below the EU average. Efforts could focus on ensuring that all European public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (i.e. Recommendation 14) and on simplifying processes and use digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users&#x2019; requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens (i.e. Recommendation 17). Lastly, potential area of improvement could be focusing on developing interfaces with base registries and authoritative sources of information, publish the semantic and technical means and documentation needed for others to connect and reuse available information (i.e. Recommendation 38).</p><p>Additional information on Slovenia&#x2019;s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring" property="dct:relation">interactive dashboards</a><span resource="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring" property="eli:title" content="interactive dashboards"/>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="../html/img/32-546.png" alt="32-546.png" class="keepElement"/></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p></div><div resource="http://example.org/ContactPoint/Slovenia" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Slovenian government signed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment &#x2013; together with other EU Member States &#x2013; to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies.

The strategy clearly sets out the direction for the development of digital public services, putting people and businesses at the heart of digital transformation. The strategy defines a framework that will enable the development of simple services and promote their widespread use. This requires a single digital identity, efficient use of modern information technology and infrastructure, and a digitally empowered public sector. The goal of the Strategy are citizen and business-centric digital public services that enable citizens and businesses to interact with public administration in an integrated, coordinated, secure and efficient way. Three strategic priorities have been identified, which represent digital targets at the highest level and are also aligned with the strategic context of the European Union: (i) by 2030, all key public services will be provided online and accessible to all users; (ii) at least 80% of key public services that are digitally accessible will also be performed digitally, and (iii) at least 80% of users of public services will use their digital identity.  </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><a href="https://www.stopbirokraciji.gov.si/fileadmin/user_upload/mju/templates/pdf/AN_VG_17-6-2019-b3_P.pdf" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Action Plan for Better Regulation</a><span resource="https://www.stopbirokraciji.gov.si/fileadmin/user_upload/mju/templates/pdf/AN_VG_17-6-2019-b3_P.pdf" property="dct:title" content="Action Plan for Better Regulation"/></p><p>Intensive work is underway to implement the measures set out in the <a href="https://www.stopbirokraciji.gov.si/fileadmin/user_upload/mju/templates/pdf/AN_VG_17-6-2019-b3_P.pdf" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Action Plan for Better</a><span resource="https://www.stopbirokraciji.gov.si/fileadmin/user_upload/mju/templates/pdf/AN_VG_17-6-2019-b3_P.pdf" property="dct:title" content="Action Plan for Better"/> with the aim to develop a systemic approach for better regulation.

On <a href="https://nio.gov.si/nio/catalog/?lang=en">the NIO Portal</a>, system specifications and documentation are available together with standards, recommendations, interoperability products, data access services, organisational rules, interoperability infrastructure and building blocks. The NIO&#x2019;s Editorial Board, a group of IT experts from various fields, are involved in the publication and monitoring of interoperability products working process on the NIO Portal. The editorial team tied to the implementation of an individual field an agreed set of contents for the efficient and effective joint implementation of interoperable public services. The remit of the NIO Editorial Board includes the national interoperability framework, education, awareness raising activities, the promotion of the NIO with wide international collaboration and the cooperation in the field of interoperability and integrated digital solutions. An important and continuous task of the Board is to raise awareness on the importance of interoperability and the establishment of DIF, NIF and EIF.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;"><img src="../html/img/32-563.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The Republic of Slovenia will provide an open, safe and secure cyberspace, which will serve as the basis for smooth functioning of the infrastructure relevant for State authorities and the economy, as well as the lives of all citizens. Rapid development of ICTs in a modern society is beneficial on one hand but, on the other hand, it determines the emergence of new and more technologically sophisticated cyber threats. There is a growing trend in using ICT for political, economic, and military pre-eminence. Cyber-attacks have become a major security threat to the contemporary world. Consequently, cybersecurity has become an important and integral part of national security. </p><p>With the adoption of the Information Security Act<a href="https://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/zakon+o+informacijski+varnosti+zinfv?lang=en">,</a> the real basis for strengthening the national cybersecurity system was set. The Information Security Administration was established within the Ministry of Public Administration with a clear mission of increasing resilience to cyber threats.

With all these new developments, achieving the goals set by the Cybersecurity Strategy has become realistic. In March 2021, the Slovenian government adopted the <a href="https://www.gov.si/drzavni-organi/vlada/seje-vlade/gradiva-v-obravnavi/show/6538">National Cyber Incident Response Plan (NCIRP)</a>, prepared by the Information Security Administration, which unifies cyber incident management procedures and provides guidelines for a coordinated response for all involved stakeholders.

The programme is designed around the concept of &#x2018;innovation diffusion lifecycle&#x2019;, meaning that its main vision is to convey more than 40 years of research, knowledge and experiences in AI into real, trustworthy and ethical AI solutions used in business, public sector and government. In order to achieve this, NpAI sets ten strategic goals that include: support to research and innovation projects, establishment of proper data and computational infrastructure and, finally, support for reference implementation projects in six priority areas (health, industry 4.0, public administration, language technologies, sustainable food production and environment, and spatial planning). The National programme for AI represents the main strategic policy instrument to support activities - from research and innovation to AI uptake - in the period 2021&#x2013;2025. NpAI foresees a special governance structure led by the <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/ministries/ministry-of-digital-transformation/">Ministry of Digital Transformation</a>  that will provide guidance and support decision making with respect to the implementation in a multi-sectorial and inter-ministerial setup of all the measures set out in the NpAI. External representatives of stakeholders and experts have also been included in order to steer implementation and changes in the future years based on technology, market and policy-based developments. The NpAI provides the policy framework and concrete support to the main phases of the innovation cycle from research and deployment to uptake activities but, with respect to the latter, measures are limited only to reference implementation projects where there is proper knowledge and capacity available and large impact envisaged. With this in mind NpUI defines six priority areas, which are listed above. Larger scale uptakes will be left to sectorial strategies and actions. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">International Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence under the Auspices of UNESCO</p><p>The Slovenian government&#x2019;s proposal to establish an <a href="https://ircai.org/">International Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence under the auspices of UNESCO (IRCAI)</a> was confirmed and adopted during the 40<sup>th</sup> session of the UNESCO General Conference in November 2019 &#x2013; unanimously and with huge support from all UNESCO Member States.

The act regulates the open and transparent functioning of the public sector and the reuse of public sector information. In principle it provides that all generally accessible public information is reusable (in line with the reuse right from the PSI Directive). The law places the emphasis on the online publication of entire databases/public sector open data (i.e. data in open, machine-readable formats for further reuse by citizens, non-governmental organisations, media, etc.). Regarding public sector databases, special attention is paid to database management by public administration bodies and to the connectivity between databases to provide simple and straightforward data access. For this purpose the metadata are defined by the <a href="http://www.uradni-list.si/1/objava.jsp?sop=2016-01-0994">Decree on the Delivery and Reuse of Public Information</a> and published the <a href="https://podatki.gov.si/posredovanje-podatkov">Manual on Opening Up PSI</a>. Apart from the legal framework, several activities have been announced in this field (hackathons, guidelines, renewal of the Open Data portal, etc.). In addition, it is important to emphasise that in principle all documents (electronic or not) produced by public bodies are publicly available based on a request after a legal review by the institution.

Consequently, also the government decree has been amended (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 146/22), listing the datasets that are of particularly high value for the society and/or economy.

Its main objective was to further emphasise the importance of social aspects in public procurement procedures and public contract execution. The second amendment to the Public Procurement Act is in use since 1 January 2022. Its main objective is making the procedure simpler and more transparent. </p><p>The Public Procurement Act lays down mandatory actions required of contracting authorities and tenderers in awarding public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts. Among other provisions, the act sets out rules on mandatory publication of procurement notices in the <a href="https://www.enarocanje.si/">Public Procurement Portal</a>, on mandatory electronic submission and electronic communication in procurement procedures, on electronic verification of tenderers via official documents the information system eDossier, on the dynamic purchasing system and electronic auctions, thus also laying the groundwork for a public, State-developed eProcurement system called e-JN <a href="https://ejn.gov.si/en/">Information System.</a> </p><p>Furthermore, the 2017 amendment to the <a href="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Sistem_javnega_narocanja/ZPVPJN/ZPVPJN_ang_julij_18.pdf" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Legal Protection in Public Procurement Procedures Act</a><span resource="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Sistem_javnega_narocanja/ZPVPJN/ZPVPJN_ang_julij_18.pdf" property="eli:title" content="Legal Protection in Public Procurement Procedures Act"/> introduced an electronic information system for legal protection procedures in public procurement, i.e. the <a href="https://www.portalerevizija.si/">eRevision Portal</a>. The eRevision Portal was established in September 2019 and enables the exchange of information and documents between contracting authorities, selected tenderers, the National Review Commission and other participants in the appeal proceedings. It communicates with the Public Procurement Portal to allow a smooth flow of information and documentation. This significantly reduced the duration of the procedure and the administrative burdens and costs for the parties involved. The use of this portal is mandatory from 1 January 2021. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing Legislation</p><p>In Slovenia, the competent authority with purview on eInvoicing is the <a href="https://www.ujp.gov.si/dokumenti/dokument.asp?id=295">Public Payments Administration of the Republic of Slovenia</a>, attached to the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>Since 1 January 2015, public sector institutions have begun receiving electronic invoices for any goods and services.

Ever since, considerable progress has been made in terms of development, availability and use of eHealth. In 2020, the act has been amended to respond to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related data-processing requirements. The amendment provided legal ground for comprehensive digitalisation of communicable disease surveillance. Moreover, it facilitated the processing of health records for all persons receiving medical treatment in Slovenia, irrespective of their nationality, by enabling the cross-border exchange of healthcare records within the Central Registry of Patient Data (CRPD). Further amendments in 2021 introduced extensions of lawful data processing (e.g. legal base for Health Insurance Institute to access Central Registry of Patient Data). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act </p><p>The <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4284" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act</a><span resource="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4284" property="eli:title" content="Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act"/> and the accompanying Regulation on Documents and Archives Protection were both passed in 2006 to regulate the management of electronic content. The act states that all electronic records, including digitalised documents, have full legal status provided they comply with certain technical conditions. The accompanying regulation governs the activities and internal rules for individuals to keep documents and/or archives, the storage of such materials in physical and digital forms, the general conditions, the registration and accreditation of digital storage equipment and services, the selection and transfer of archives to public archival institutions, the processing and keeping of registries of archives, the protection of film and private archives, the use of archives in archival institutions and the work of the Archives Commission. The law also contains provisions regarding the long-term validity of eSignatures. This law eliminated the obligation of certifying internal rules for companies and public authorities at the Archives Commission and simplified the procedures for accreditation. It granted companies and other private organisations the power to decide, autonomously and without any State interference, the best method to store digital documents, leaving them the choice of the solutions and technologies to adopt.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Amendments to the Tax Procedure Act</p><p>With the 2021 amendments to the <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4703" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Tax Procedure Act</a><span resource="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4703" property="eli:title" content="Tax Procedure Act"/>, legal ground was provided for online public auctions.</p><h2>Innovative technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big data</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud computing</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance computing</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-609.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Through the SPOT portal, businesses can use electronic services to establish a company and carry out other obligatory or frequent procedures, either at start-up or later (submission of forms for social insurance registration, declaration of changes to information on family members, notification of needs for workers, declaration of tax information, etc.). Users can carry out procedures independently online, using a valid digital certificate or, for certain procedures, they would need to visit one of the SPOT points or a public notary. The main advantages of the SPOT portal are that it enables a free-of-charge sole trader registration usually within one day (in the past it took seven days) and the registration of a company with limited liabilities within three days (in the past it took more than 60 days). It also enables several important eServices. The majority of services carried out via the SPOT portal or the SPOT points are free of charge. New services are constantly developed for SPOT. In terms of development of new services, relevant stakeholders are being involved and the principles of interoperability are followed. The development is carried out with the cooperation of different governmental bodies. It includes the connection of different IT systems into the eService of SPOT, aiming at reusing already available data from different registries or systems and following the Once-Only principle, where possible. In 2020, an important new functionality - the electronic sick leave - was introduced on the portal, which significantly reduced the administrative burden. The estimated cost savings for all participating stakeholders are EUR&#xa0;11.5 million yearly. In 2020&#x2013;2021, new electronic services for municipalities were published on the portal, both on the Portal for Citizens eUprava and on the Business Portal SPOT.

Firstly, it represents the central catalogue of records and databases in the country; it is a central inventory of metadata from all records and databases managed by State authorities, municipalities and other public sector bodies. Secondly, it represents a single website for publishing data in open and machine-readable formats. The portal provides everyone with the right to a free and easy reuse of freely accessible data published in  open (licence free) format for any purpose (i.e. for profit or not for profit). On the portal, all public sector bodies publish data by category. The goal was to establish the so-called Open Data Ecosystem based on the OPSI Portal, to encourage cooperation between all stakeholders concerned by the opening and/or reuse of data. In March 2020, the Slovenian government achieved its goal by establishing the OPSIHub. Slovenia ranks among the best countries in open data in various rankings and also ensures a high level of protection of the right of access to public information, with the aim of increasing citizens&apos; participation and public authorities&apos; accountability for good governance and the fight against corruption. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">The <a href="https://ejn.gov.si/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="eprocurement system e-jn" resource="https://ejn.gov.si/">eProcurement System e-JN</a> </p><p><a href="https://ejn.gov.si/en/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="after the technological renovation at the end of 2018, the system combines functionalities that were originally developed as part of different stand-alone modules/applications " resource="https://ejn.gov.si/en/">After the technological renovation at the end of 2018, the system combines functionalities that were originally developed as part of different stand-alone modules/applications </a>(eSubmissions, eAuctions, eDossier, eCatalogue and eInternal procedures).

Since 2004, the system has allowed individuals and companies to log in using different electronic identifications. The system offers several eServices. The most important are: filing tax forms, declarations and returns, accessing data on tax liabilities of taxable persons, electronic signature of documents, transfer of authorisations, etc. In 2018, the eDavki Portal was updated to a user-friendly version with easy access to information and eServices. In 2019, the eTax System introduced a simplified way of signing documents without using a signature component and a qualified digital certificate. This enabled the eDavki Portal to be used on all operating systems and browsers as well as mobile devices. The development of this portal marked the start of the unification of the eDavki and the eCustoms portals. From 2019, individuals can use a new mobile app called eDavki that includes all eServices from the web portal eDavki plus additional eServices, such as a personalised calendar through which taxpayers receive notifications of their specific obligations and rights, pre-completed forms and assistance in completing forms, information on the settlement of social security contributions, etc. The eTax System is being regularly updated and expanded to improve existing eServices and offer brand new ones. In 2021, the majority of new eForms and eServices were related, mitigating and remedying the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The systems in the eCustoms Portal are regularly updated according the requirements of the UCC (Union Customs Code) and the MASP (Multi-Annual Strategic Plan for Electronic Customs). The project, initiated by the European Commission, aims to replace paper-format customs procedures with EU-wide electronic procedures to create a more efficient and modern customs environment. Main upgrades have been made in 2021 when we launched the new import system and the new control import system. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-627.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Currently, more than 280 public institutions are covered by the electronic service system. Citizens can use their secure electronic mailbox, which they can open on the eGovernment portal, or at the information system VEP.SI. The new law on De-bureaucratisation adopted at the end of 2021 introduces two new methods, namely &quot;notification with confirmation&quot; and &quot;notification without confirmation&quot;, with delivery in the citizen&apos;s regular electronic mailbox.

The members of the Council are representatives of Ministries, their constituent bodies and government departments. </p><p>The Council consists of a strategic group (State secretaries from certain governmental bodies) and an operational working group (heads of informatics in all bodies and government services of the State administration). </p><p>The Council has two main tasks:</p><ul><li>Promoting the digitalisation and digital transformation in State administration and e-services related to State administration for the population of Slovenia and the Slovenian economy; and</li><li>Coordinating and issuing opinions on the eligibility of investments and projects of State administration bodies.</li></ul><p>The Council will cease to function when the Ministry of Digital Transformation will fully take over its tasks, as stipulated by the latest amendment to the State Administration Act (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 18 /23), ZDU-1O).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Secretariat-General of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia</p><p>The <a href="http://www.gsv.gov.si/en/">Secretariat-General of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia</a> is primarily responsible for conducting the sessions of the government, its working bodies, expert councils and other governmental bodies, and for monitoring the implementation of decisions adopted by the government and the obligations undertaken by or imposed on it. </p><p>One of the key tasks of the Secretariat-General is to ensure the smooth operation of information systems whose primary function is to support the decision-making processes. Electronic services and systems developed for this purpose facilitate the harmonisation of documents at different levels and the provision of information on government decisions to various target user groups and to the public.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ICT Association at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry</p><p>The Ministry of Digital Transformation works with the <a href="https://eng.gzs.si/vsebina/About-Us/Organisation/Branch-Associations-and-Regional-Chambers/Branch-Associations">ICT Association of Slovenia (ZIT) at the Chamber of Commerce and Industry</a>. The association strives to connect public administration and ICT companies as well as to cooperate in marketing and implementing ICT solutions abroad. There are several cooperation initiatives, from 5G networks, eIdentity legislation, smart city solutions to the Artificial Intelligence National Strategy and the <a href="https://opendatahubs.eu/">Open Data National Hub</a>. The ZIT runs several sections, competence centres, initiatives and projects that support the ICT sector and the digitalisation of the economy in Slovenia. The key sections are:</p><ul><li>ZITEX &#x2013; the export section, organising activities to support the internationalisation of the industry;</li><li>AIDAS &#x2013; section for data science and artificial intelligence to work on key topics on these very important areas for the country and common EU digital market; </li><li>SOEK &#x2013; improving the business environment for telecom solutions providers and cooperating on the regulation on digital connectivity; </li><li>SeGov &#x2013; cooperating with the government, connecting providers and exporting solutions;</li><li>S3P &#x2013; promoting online-business and eCommerce, cooperating with the government offices in the field of financial regulation;</li><li>SeKV &#x2013; networking in the field of cybersecurity;</li><li>ScienceTech &#x2013; networking high technology companies for further cooperation with CERN, ESA, EUMETSAT, etc.;</li><li>eHealth &#x2013; section working closely with Ministry of Health in developing Slovene eHealth system including the strategy, key goals and projects.

The Slovenian Digital Coalition is focused on attaining a cross-sector multiplier impact, accelerating the development of the digital society and leveraging opportunities for the development of ICT and the internet. In November 2020, the Slovenian Digital Coalition organised a forum showcasing three years of work and assessing the current state of play in the field of digital transformation. A wide variety of stakeholders took part in this forum and the topics discussed covered key areas in this field. There are three focus areas for the Digital Coalition:(i) digital economy; (ii) digital skills and education system, and (iii) regulatory and business ecosystem. Each area is supported by a coalition strategic working group. Furthermore, the Slovenian Digital Coalition established a project team on the topics of smart cities and society and blockchain. The coalition is also actively participating in different events, and it represents the point of view of businesses. It also highlights those areas which would require additional activities in order to keep on growing.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Information Commissioner </p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/other-institutions/information-commissioner/">Information Commissioner</a> performs the duties of the national Data Protection Authority: it oversees the application of the rules on personal data protection (including the GDPR), the Personal Data Protection Act and the Act on the Protection of Personal Data in the Area of Treatment of Criminal Offences. It performs inspections and issues penalties with regards to violations of the above-mentioned laws. The Information Commissioner also acts as a body of appeal for resolving complaints from the data subjects regarding their rights, namely the right of access by the data subject, the right to rectification, the right to erasure, etc. </p><p>On the other hand, the Information Commissioner oversees the application of the Access to Public Information Act with regards to individual complaints when liable public sector bodies refuse access to public documents or refuse a request for reuse of public sector information. The role that the Information Commissioner has played is vital in ensuring a high degree of institutional transparency. The number of individual complaints is steadily growing every year, which shows that the awareness on the right to access to public information has risen also among Slovenian citizens. The Information Commissioner receives only a low number of complaints every year regarding the right to reuse public information when compared to the number of complaints raised over the refusal of access to public documents. This can be interpreted as evidence that government efforts to promote and enable the reuse of public sector information are working.</p><h2>Subnational (Federal, Regional and Local)</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Municipalities</p><p>In accordance with the constitutional provisions, <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/topics/political-system/">Slovenian municipalities and urban municipalities</a> are autonomous in the field of introducing eSolutions. Local eGovernment initiatives are solely under the responsibility of local authorities, mostly municipalities, which implement them using their own mechanisms and time schedules. </p><p>Voluntary coordination is taking place in the framework of local government associations. For instance, the <a href="https://www.zmos.si/english/">Association of Urban Municipalities of Slovenia</a> established the Committee for Digitalisation and Smart Cities, which unites experts of the eleven urban municipalities. Cities exchange information on best practices, solutions and challenges and prepare position papers on State policies and public tenders. As the resources for implementing digital solutions at local level are limited, cities explore possibilities for cooperation in projects and initiatives that could be co&#x2011;financed by EU or State funds. </p><p>The <a href="https://skupnostobcin.si/english/">Association of Municipalities and Towns of Slovenia (SOS)</a> is another example of coordination of local self-government bodies. Besides working with bodies dealing with digital transition, the SOS coordinates access rights and offers support to the local authorities on the eTourism system. The SOS established a strategic partnership with the University of Ljubljana, which resulted in the creation of 4P Digital Innovation Hub(<a href="https://4pdih.com/en/intro-page/">4PDIH</a>). The aim of the 4PDIH is to foster awareness and provide services to grow digital skills, share digital experience and case studies locally, regionally and internationally, and support the government to adapt regulation and open its data to foster entrepreneurship.</p><p/><p>6</p><p>Cross-border Digital </p><p>Public Administration Services </p><p/></div><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/structure/Slovenia" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Cross border Digital Public Administration Services for Citizens and Businesses</h1><p>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to &#x2018;life and travel&#x2019;, as well as &#x2018;doing business&#x2019; abroad.
