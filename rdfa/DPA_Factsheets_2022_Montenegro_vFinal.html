The goal of introducing the eDMS in State administration bodies is to create a more efficient, high-quality and transparent eGovernment. The system enables faster exchange of information, reduction of paperwork and greater security when storing documents. Electronic document management allows a precisely defined flow of the document, from the moment of entry into the system, processing by the user and electronic signing to its archiving, which means that the system monitors the entire life cycle of the document from creation to archiving. The advantage of this system is that in addition to managing documents which were originally created in electronic form, it provides for the possibility of digitizing and managing documents created in paper form, a procedure which is now recognized by new legal solutions.</p><p>The eDMS has been established in 16 institutions and is fully used without any auxiliary records (internal delivery books, records, registers, etc.) in nine of these.
