The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-193.png" alt="P59#yIS1" class="keepElement"/></p><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles).

The act comes in the wake of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018, with the aim to clarify and strengthen the data-sharing rights and obligations of public bodies. The DSGA paves the way for more efficient and cost-effective service delivery by public bodies by providing a clear legal basis for the sharing of personal data in certain circumstances. The DSGA allows for the sharing of personal data between public bodies where the sharing is for the performance of a function of either of the public bodies. </p><p>The Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019 also sets a series of criteria and purposes which must be met before any data set is designated as a full base registry by the Minister for Public Expenditure NDP and Reform. A base registry may consolidate data collected by various organisations into one place so that Public Service Bodies can discover and reuse high quality and up to date information instead of recollecting from the public again. The establishment of trusted sources of information already collected from the public for PSBs for continuous use is already a key driver of government strategy to reduce the recollection burden on public services and citizens. Establishing base registries as single sources of trusted information for reuse for public services is a key action of the <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1d6bc7-public-service-data-strategy-2019-2023/">Public Services Data Strategy 2019-2023</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/136b9-connecting-government-2030-a-digital-and-ict-strategy-for-irelands-public-service/">Connecting Government 2030: A Digital and ICT Strategy for Ireland&#x2019;s Public Service strategies</a>.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-346.png" alt="P262#y1" class="keepElement"/>Guidance on the Data Sharing Governance Framework under the DSGA 2019</p><p>Public Service Bodies wishing to leverage the DSGA 2019 as their legal basis for sharing personal data can access the Data Sharing Framework for the Public Service. This framework (set out in Section 2.3 above) provides a common set of key processes which public bodies follow when they wish to use the DSGA 2019 as a basis to share personal information. A public consultation is one of the key stages in this new process and delivers transparency to both GDPR compliance and safe handling of personal information.

This network is a privately managed Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), wide area multi-carrier, national network (WAN) that supports multiple Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for public sector bodies. Key tenets of the GN are high speed, high capacity and resilient connections. The enhanced resilience that is built into GN through the use of MPLS is designed to ensure, in so far as is possible, that public sector bodies have several secure resilient paths both within and external to their own agency traffic be that voice, video or data. GN offers a number of potential cost and operational benefits: inter-agency collaboration and delivery of joined-up government services; access for all agencies to network capability and products/technology (regardless of size); execution of a number of standard day-to-day infrastructure services allowing agencies to focus on their core programmes and services; improvement of security for government information systems; internet access for agencies; and commercial advantages of an aggregated procurement approach, resulting in reduced costs and high quality services. </p><p>In 2018, through a coordinated and innovative nationwide approach to the delivery of connectivity, economies of scale have been achieved with standardised services to agencies in cities, towns and more remote locations where previously only limited services existed. The GN also supports centralised voice services and centralised corporate and guest Wi-Fi services, facilitating public service bodies to deploy secure wireless networks in multiple locations with minimum investment in infrastructure. This network also hosts the Gateways to the European Network of Administrations sTESTA.

This project consists in building a low latency platform with a high speed backbone using edge compute nodes to enable a faster response. This Platform will interconnect with the local access technologies of the carriers, including Stand-alone 5G as it becomes available nationwide, and will connect to Government and Commercial Datacentres as well as Cloud providers. This will allow for processing of data at the appropriate location, be that at an edge compute node, a regional compute node, or in the Cloud.</p><p>A variety of public services shall be subsequently developed, tested and deployed using the platform, notably for Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) and &#x201c;test before invest&#x201d; for SMEs and start-ups. The analysis and processing of information at the appropriate point will enable faster, more informed responses to incidents than human-reliant monitoring could provide. The Public Sectors and staff that will benefit from the proposal are public health, veterinary/agriculture inspectors, social workers, policing and local authorities etc. as the platform enables the provision of country-wide edge compute, enabling effective and responsive public services.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><p>Ireland uses the Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) network as the main cross border infrastructure to communicate digitally among the EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Death Events Publishing Service</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform runs the <a href="https://deathevents.gov.ie/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="death events publishing service" resource="https://deathevents.gov.ie/">Death Events Publishing Service</a>, distributing information on death events to a range of public sector bodies to take action as appropriate in relation to services that the deceased person(s) may have been receiving.
