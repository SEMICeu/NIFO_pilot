More specifically, it identifies the need to establish a data-based administration in the country, with interoperable data connections between administrative services on different levels (local, national and European) and aspects (legal, organisational, semantic and technical). </p><p>Apart from technology neutrality and IT security requirements, a development based on software with open-source codes needs to be encouraged. To that end, the legislative framework was established according to the National Infocommunication Strategy 2014&#x2013;2020 with the adoption of <a href="http://njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=193173" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Act No. CCXXII of 2015 on the General Rules for Electronic Administration and Trust Services</a><span resource="http://njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=193173" property="dct:title" content="Act No. CCXXII of 2015 on the General Rules for Electronic Administration and Trust Services"/> (hereinafter, the eAdministration Act). Pursuant to the eAdministration Act, from 1&#xa0;January 2018 the cooperating bodies involved in administrative processes shall obtain information (data or documents) from another cooperating body rather than asking the customer (citizen or business) to resubmit it. Information must be obtained by automated data exchange processes, where possible, or otherwise by a simple secure information exchange. Furthermore, according to the eAdministration Act electronically cooperating organisations are obliged to prepare and publish information transfer rules, as well as send them to the Electronic Administration Supervisory Authority (E&#xdc;F) within the Ministry of the Interior.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Sector Information Reuse</p><p>In 2012, the public sector information (PSI) Directive was fully implemented in line with all EU requirements in the form of the Public Data Act (Act No. LXIII of 2012). The 2013 amendment of the PSI Directive was then implemented by the deadline of 2015 (Act No. XCVI of 2015). The Hungarian implementation went beyond the provisions of the PSI Directive in some points. </p><p>Furthermore, the new <a href="https://ai-hungary.com/api/v1/companies/15/files/137203/view">Strategy on Artificial Intelligence 2020&#x2013;2030</a> was adopted, including a dedicated part on data policy and data reuse which calls for a proper institutional background and a one&#x2011;way&#x2011;access data portal. Within the framework of the strategy, the establishment of a new national open data portal has been started and the National Data Asset Management Agency (<em>Nemzeti Adatvagyon &#xdc;gyn&#xf6;ks&#xe9;g,</em> NAV&#xdc;) has been established with the main purpose to facilitate and coordinate the reuse of public sector data among public sector bodies. The Agency also provides analysis and information services to public sector bodies. With the establishment of the Agency, the proper institutional background outlined in the strategy has been successfully created. </p><p>Finally, the planned legislative changes will facilitate and support the implementation of the Public Data Act and will provide the legal framework to the functioning of the Agency and the reuse of PSI.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Central Authentication Agent</p><p>The Central Authentication Agent building block supports the use of different electronic identification (eID) services, including the Client Gate trusted profile, the national eID card and a partial code telephone authentication. Since February 2018, eServices already integrated with the Central Authentication Agent service can be accessed via all these eID methods. </p><p>According to current plans, eIDAS authentication will also be available within the Central Authentication Agent. The Hungarian eIDAS node is under development, and the preparations for the Hungarian eID (the eID card) to join the eIDAS scheme and the development of the eIDAS proxy service are also in progress. </p><p>In January 2022 the number of valid eID cards issued since the launch in January 2016 surpassed 7.1 million and the number of Client Gate accounts exceeded 5.1 million.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Government Projects and Cybersecurity</p><p>The National Cyber Defence Institute of the Special Service for National Security must assess the conformity of each public administration IT and eGovernment service development project with the rules of Act No. L of 2013.

The development of the new portal was then started. In addition, with the adoption of the Artificial Intelligence Strategy in September 2020, the strategic and political frameworks for the establishment of the new portal were also defined. In this context, Act No. XCI of 2021 on the National Data Asset set forth the set up of the Open Data Portal to the Hungarian Data Asset Management Agency. The launch is expected in the first half of 2022.</p><p>The aim is to establish a complete and responsible national data management scheme, which includes sharing non-personal data assets created in the public sector and having a significant multiplier effect to exploit the potential economic stimulation effect associated with their wide availability. An additional goal is the creation of an integrated public approach, which can help exploit the benefits of such economic growth considering the investment needed to guarantee such open access to data. Based on this principle, different types of data shall be identified and either made freely available or funnelled into the data market. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Kormany.hu</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Egeszsegugy.gov.hu</p><p>The state-of-the-art IT communication and collaboration platform called <a href="https://e-egeszsegugy.gov.hu/ekapu" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="electronic health cooperation service space (eeszt)" resource="https://e-egeszsegugy.gov.hu/ekapu">Electronic Health Cooperation Service Space (EESZT)</a> enables information systems and health professionals to work together.

The system can electronically store information about patients (health status, treatments, etc.) and provides access thereto for doctors, pharmacists, therapists, nurses, etc. working in different institutions to use the same data.</p><p>Since 1&#xa0;November 2017, all publicly financed healthcare providers (general practitioners, specialist care institutions, etc.) and pharmacies have been obliged to use EESZT services to provide faster, more convenient and more efficient patient care. Since December 2017, everyone has been able to access their eProfile data, event catalogue (i.e. a list of the medical care services administered in the institutions connected to the EESZT), and patient records and documents, including eReferrals and ePrescriptions, after authentication on the Citizen Portal.</p><p>As of 31 December 2021, 6&#xa0;375 general practitioners (95.7%), 190 public in&#x2011;patient healthcare institutions (91.3%), 2&#xa0;984 pharmacies (96.3%) and 8&#xa0;798 private healthcare service providers (70.2 %) were connected to the EESZT cloud. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of ePrescriptions has been constantly over 95%, up from 70% before. Also the proportion of telemedicine care increased from 0% before the COVID-19 pandemic to 13% in December 2021.

More specifically, the KKSZB makes it possible to connect systems with different technological, operational and integrational levels, as well as to reduce redundant data storage and data integrity errors resulting from former practice. That way, the KKSZB ensures electronic communication, interoperability and secure data exchange of authentic data among public administrative authorities.</p><p>The KKSZB may be joined as service provider and client at the same time, making it technically possible for applications targeted at citizens and businesses to reach all services provided by the connected service providers via the KKSZB, as long as they have permission to do so.</p><p>The total number of data exchange transactions via the KKSZB was around 60 million per month in 2021. Since the same year the connection of private service providers has also been possible, with 39 private services connected in live environment. Compared to the last reported year, 87 additional organisations have been connected to the KKSZB. As a result, 205 organisations are now using the platform to provide data exchange services and 356 services related to base registries are available, including most of the 27 registries enumerated by Government Decree 451/2016 (XII 19) on the Detailed Rules for Electronic Administration (i.e. the implementing decree of the eAdministration Act).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Municipality ASP</p><p>The goal of Municipality ASP is to provide modern, integrated and cost-effective state&#x2011;of-the-art IT solutions for local governments based on the application service provider&#x2019;s central hardware and software infrastructure, fostering standardised internal operation of local governments and a common platform-based provision of local eGovernment services to citizens and businesses. The service provides integrated back-office systems (financial management software, municipal tax software, document management software, industrial and commercial management software, property cadastre, eAdministration web portal and online form management) for the daily tasks of municipalities, as well as client-side eGovernment services, on a single platform for 99% of all municipalities.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Client Gate</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Central Authentication Agent</p><p>In January 2016, a new central identification solution, the <a href="https://kau.gov.hu/informacio/kau" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="central authentication agent" resource="https://kau.gov.hu/informacio/kau">Central Authentication Agent</a>, was launched, supporting the use of different electronic identification and authentication services, including the already existing Client Gate and the newly introduced national eID card, as well as the partial code telephone authentication.

The EKR is operated by <a href="https://nekszt.hu/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="nekszt ltd." resource="https://nekszt.hu/">NEKSZT Ltd.</a>, a State-owned company under the control of the Office of the Prime Minister.</p><p>The EKR was developed in late 2017 and from 1&#xa0;January to 14&#xa0;April 2018 was used on a voluntary basis. However, eProcurement through the EKR has become compulsory for all contracting authorities since 15&#xa0;April 2018 (though central purchasing bodies may partially use their own platforms). At that point, the paper-based administration of procurements ceased.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Online Invoice System </p><p>Since July 2018, <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="einvoicing" resource="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/">eInvoicing</a> has become obligatory for transactions including an output VAT of more than HUF 100&#xa0;000 (approximately EUR 320) between domestic taxpayers. In July 2020, the amount of output VAT was reduced to HUF 0, with all invoices issued between domestic taxpayers being exchanged through the available system. </p><p>In January 2021, the obligation of sending invoice data was extended to all kinds of invoices issued by domestic taxpayers, but taxpayers had an additional three months to prepare themselves for fulfilling the obligation without any sanction. For this purpose, the National Tax and Customs Administration (NTCA) developed and launched a central <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/home" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="online invoice system" resource="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/home">Online Invoice System</a> connected to the financial management software or the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system of businesses via machine&#x2011;to&#x2011;machine interface. In case of paper invoices, data must be provided manually using the online service within five days, also encouraging businesses to turn to the use of eInvoicing. The NTCA also provides an online invoicing solution free of charge, mainly for SMEs, that can be used to issue eInvoices as well as paper invoices, and automatically sends the invoice data to the NTCA, regardless of the amount of output VAT. To promote and encourage eInvoicing and digital administration, in May 2020 this free online invoicing programme was made available through a mobile app, also helping to reduce administrative steps. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing in Public Procurement</p><p>To comply with Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement, since 18&#xa0;April 2019 the Public Procurement Act has been requiring contracting authorities to receive and process invoices which comply with the relevant European standard. The Public Procurement Act does not clarify further the means to process invoices, leaving it to the contracting authorities to choose the method of transmission and processing.</p><p>A so-called eInvoicing module is also available in the EKR, enabling to verify whether an invoice complies with the European standard EN 16931-1:2017 and the syntax list published by the European Commission in the Official Journal of the EU. The eInvoicing module can help contracting authorities to decide whether they have a legal obligation to receive and process a specific invoice or not.</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Payment and Settlement System</p><p><a href="https://www.nisz.hu/hu/efer-Ã¢ÂÂ-elektronikus-fizetÃÂ©si-ÃÂ©s-elszÃÂ¡molÃÂ¡si-rendszer" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="nisz zrt" resource="https://www.nisz.hu/hu/efer-Ã¢ÂÂ-elektronikus-fizetÃÂ©si-ÃÂ©s-elszÃÂ¡molÃÂ¡si-rendszer">NISZ Zrt</a>., as the provider of the Electronic Payment and Settlement System (EFER), provides an electronic payment service for both electronic and traditional paper-based procedures.
