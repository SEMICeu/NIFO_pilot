The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p>The strategy followed up on the priorities of the EU Digital Single Market. At the national level, it accelerated ongoing processes in terms of building the digital market and carrying out various measures that arose from the most recent cross-sectoral policies of the EU. The strategy also reflected the strategic materials and recommendations of international organisations (EU, OECD, UN, G7 and G20) that consider digital transformation to be the key to inclusive and sustainable growth. The strategy puts emphasis on new digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, 5G technology, big data and analytical processing of data, blockchain or high-performance computers, which will eventually become a new engine of economic growth and competitiveness.</p><p>Several areas were identified regarding the necessity to multiply the potential of digital transformation: </p><ul><li>Economy;</li><li>Society and education;</li><li>Public services;</li><li>Rural development; and</li><li>Science, research and innovation.</li></ul><p>The targets of the process are the citizens, whose everyday life should get simpler, and entrepreneurs, whose businesses should be supported by various incentives and whose bureaucratic burden should be eliminated.</p><ul><li>Improvement of education and fostering digital skills and employment for the modern era; </li><li>Creation of a basis for a modern digital economy; </li><li>Improvement of the ability of public services to innovate and use data; and</li><li>Development and practical implementation of artificial intelligence.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National eGovernment Concept </p><ol><li>Shared services, government cloud and central common blocks;</li><li>Management of data;</li><li>User orientation, multi-canal access, life events;</li><li>Digital office and starting point for digital transformation;</li><li>Public procurement;</li><li>Human resources in IT in public service; and</li><li>Cybersecurity and information security.</li></ol><p>Every strategic target will be regularly evaluated based on indicators.</p><p>The National eGovernment Concept concerns all elements of public administration.

Therefore, this element was added to the new ITPS act. This act sets out cybersecurity measures specific for the public sector and it covers all public bodies, even those who do not meet the definition of &#x2018;essential services operator&#x2019;. The ITPS act also strengthens the competences in proactive Computer security incident response team (CSIRT) services of the Slovak government CSIRT, which include scanning, testing from the internet or governmental network, cybersecurity audits, and hardening or penetration testing of the public bodies&apos; IT.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act No. 305/2013 on eGovernment </p><p>The Parliament adopted <a href="https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2013/305/20201230.html" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Act No. 305/2013 on eGovernment</a><span resource="https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2013/305/20201230.html" property="eli:title" content="Act No. 305/2013 on eGovernment"/>, laying down the basic principles upon which a future electronic public administration will operate. The act did not replace traditional paper procedures from the official agenda, but it created a comprehensive electronic alternative. It also described a number of key elements, such as pursuance by proxy, basic registries, eDesk modules document conversion, electronic payment of fees, authentication of persons in public administration information systems, eDelivery, eForms, electronic personal mailbox, the administration and operation of a central portal for public administration and Integrated Service Points (ISPs) for assisted public administration eServices. Furthermore, it also laid the foundation for a common data layer by defining a common central module for intergovernmental communication. This module implemented the rules and processes for data exchange among IT systems from different segments (see 4.2.4 Interconnection of base registries) and applied the concepts of Master Data Management.
