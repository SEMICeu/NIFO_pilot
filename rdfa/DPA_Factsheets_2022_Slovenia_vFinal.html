In this context, a set of actions was put in place. The development of a central metadata dictionary is a priority and is also the prerequisite for a data repository, which will provide views with different perspectives and contexts, and will be the basis for knowing and understanding the data. The repository will provide information on how applications are connected to the data, what institutions are responsible for the data, and how data are used through public administration procedures.</p><ul><li>A service-oriented government with a user-centred approach that puts people, their user experience, and their needs as the primary focus.

Both professional development and smart recruitment will play a role in this strategic approach, with the latter presenting an opportunity to promote diversity and inclusion; and</li><li>Good digital governance that ensures proper project oversight and strategic prioritization, and allows to learn from past mistakes and build on past successes.

Current maintenance of the three real estate records (Land Cadastre, Building Cadastre and Real Estate Register), kept by the same body, has shown the need to establish a modern information system for recording real estate data in one record - the Real Estate Cadastre. The entry of all data on real estate in the same record, with the appropriate control system, eliminates the risk of discrepancies and allows greater consistency of the data. All the entered data will be kept permanently. In the Real Estate Cadastre, there are also data on cadastral municipalities, actual use of the land, areas of credit ratings of the land and the layer of temporary entries (building rights and data on the area of real easement or land registry decision). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Vehicle Registry</p><p>As concerns the Vehicle Registry, the <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO5791" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Motor Vehicles Act </a><span resource="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO5791" property="eli:title" content="Motor Vehicles Act "/>sets out the conditions for the placement of motor vehicles and trailers on the market, their registration and operation on the road network, and in the performance of agricultural or forestry work, the conditions for carrying out such tasks as the technical services, the registration of organisations managing databases on vehicles, and the monitoring of the implementation of this law. The <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=PRAV10486">Rules on the Registration of Motor Vehicles</a> and trailers set out the registration conditions to be met, the procedures for the registration of motor vehicles and trailers, the issuance and revalidation of transport permits, the deregistration of vehicles, the change of vehicle owner or user data, the issuance of permits for test drives, record-keeping obligations and the storage of documents and evidence. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Procurement Act</p><p>On 1 April 2016, a <a href="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Predpisi/ZJN-3_ang_prevod.pdf" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Public Procurement Act</a><span resource="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Predpisi/ZJN-3_ang_prevod.pdf" property="eli:title" content="Public Procurement Act"/> entered into force, which transposed Directive 2014/24/EU and Directive 2014/25/EU. On 1 November 2018, an <a href="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Sistem_javnega_narocanja/ZJN-3A_anj_nov2018.pdf">amendment to the Public Procurement A</a>ct came in force. Its main objective was to further emphasise the importance of social aspects in public procurement procedures and public contract execution. The second amendment to the Public Procurement Act is in use since 1 January 2022, whose main objective is simplification of the procedure and additional transparency.</p><p>The Public Procurement Act lays down mandatory actions required of contracting authorities and tenderers in awarding public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts. Among other provisions, the act sets out rules on mandatory publication of procurement notices in the <a href="https://www.enarocanje.si/">Public Procurement Portal</a>, on mandatory electronic submission and electronic communication in procurement procedures, on electronic verification of tenderers via official documents the information system eDossier, on the dynamic purchasing system and electronic auctions, thus also laying the groundwork for a public, State-developed eProcurement system called e-JN <a href="https://ejn.gov.si/en/">Information System. After the technological renovation at the end of 2018, the system combines functionalities that were originally developed as part of different stand-alone modules/applications </a>(eSubmissions, eAuctions, eDossier, eCatalogue and eInternal procedures for public authorities). </p><p>Furthermore, the 2017 amendment to the <a href="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Sistem_javnega_narocanja/ZPVPJN/ZPVPJN_ang_julij_18.pdf" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Legal Protection in Public Procurement Procedures Act</a><span resource="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Sistem_javnega_narocanja/ZPVPJN/ZPVPJN_ang_julij_18.pdf" property="eli:title" content="Legal Protection in Public Procurement Procedures Act"/> introduced an electronic information system for legal protection procedures in public procurement, i.e. the <a href="https://www.portalerevizija.si/">eRevision Portal</a>. The eRevision Portal was established in September 2019 and enables the exchange of information and documents between contracting authorities, selected tenderers, the National Review Commission and other participants in the appeal proceedings. The eRevision Portal enables a widespread flow of information about the course of the review procedure. It communicates with the Public Procurement Portal to allow a smooth flow of information and documentation. This will significantly reduce the duration of the procedure and the administrative burdens and costs for the parties involved. The use of this portal is mandatory from 1 January 2021. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing Legislation</p><p>In Slovenia, the competent authority with purview on eInvoicing is the <a href="https://www.ujp.gov.si/dokumenti/dokument.asp?id=295">Public Payments Administration of the Republic of Slovenia</a>, attached to the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>Since 1 January 2015, public sector institutions have begun receiving electronic invoices for any goods and services.

Ever since, considerable progress has been made in terms of development, availability and use of eHealth. The Healthcare Databases Act was amended in 2018 to support cancer screening programmes and clinical registries. In 2020, the act was further amended in order to respond to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related data-processing requirements. The amendment provided legal ground for comprehensive digitalisation of communicable disease surveillance. Moreover, it facilitated the processing of health records for all persons receiving medical treatment in Slovenia, irrespective of their nationality, by enabling the cross-border exchange of healthcare records within the Central Registry of Patient Data (CRPD). Further amendments in 2021 introduced extensions of lawful data processing (e.g. legal base for Health Insurance Institute to access Central Registry of Patient Data). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act </p><p>The <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4284" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act</a><span resource="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4284" property="eli:title" content="Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act"/> and the accompanying Regulation on Documents and Archives Protection were both passed in 2006 to regulate the management of electronic content. The act states that all electronic records, including digitalised documents, have full legal status provided they comply with certain technical conditions. The accompanying regulation governs the activities and internal rules for individuals to keep documents and/or archives, the storage of such materials in physical and digital forms, the general conditions, the registration and accreditation of digital storage equipment and services, the selection and transfer of archives to public archival institutions, the processing and keeping of registries of archives, the protection of film and private archives, the use of archives in archival institutions and the work of the Archives Commission. The law also contains provisions regarding the long-term validity of eSignatures. Later amendments to the act took place in 2014. </p><p>This law eliminated the obligation of certifying internal rules for companies and public authorities at the Archives Commission and simplified the procedures for accreditation. It granted companies and other private organisations the power to decide, autonomously and without any State interference, the best method to store digital documents, leaving them the choice of the solutions and technologies to adopt.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Amendments to the Tax Procedure Act</p><p>With the 2021 amendments to the <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4703" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Tax Procedure Act</a><span resource="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4703" property="eli:title" content="Tax Procedure Act"/> (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia), legal ground was provided for online public auctions.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big data</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud computing</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance computing</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Communications Act</p><p>The field of electronic communications in the Republic of Slovenia is regulated by the <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO6405" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Electronic Communications Act</a><span resource="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO6405" property="eli:title" content="Electronic Communications Act"/> (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No. 109/12, 110/13, 40/14-ZIN-B, 54/14-odl.

It was completely redesigned using a new system architecture and a new user interface. It was based on a CMS system, which enables effortless content maintenance.</p><p>In 2021, more than 30 back-offices, registers and other databases have connected to the portal. Services are provided according to life events. </p><p>The main elements of the renewed portal are the electronic services, which are seamlessly integrated into the content and easily accessible. Users may access various services (currently about 250) through the integration of public bodies&#x2019; information systems. Every authenticated user can use their digital certificate to access personal storage, which allows them to store their private documents. The users can also view their personal data from various public records (e.g. personal information, information about their vehicle and real estate property).</p><p>eUprava is the first portal that enables its users to authenticate and eSign the applications with mobile phones. This functionality is based on the integration of SI&#x2011;PASS (the authentication and eSignature service) that, since April 2018, also offers an authentication and eSignature mobile service called smsPASS (see below for more info on SI-PASS and smsPASS). </p><p>Since November 2020, the portal has been integrated with the new central solution for eDelivery SI-CeV. The users can activate their secure mailbox within their My e-Government personal space to receive official documents according to the administrative procedure legislation from more than 100 public institutions. In 2021, the possibility has been introduced to authenticate on the portal using foreign certificates via eIDAS mechanisms.</p><p>In 2020&#x2013;2021, new electronic services for municipalities were published on the portal, both on the Portal for Citizens eUprava and on the Business Portal <a href="https://spot.gov.si/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="spot" resource="https://spot.gov.si/">SPOT</a>.</p><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, some successful new electronic applications were offered, also without eAuthentication, to increase the number of possible users (e.g. financial aid for students, residence registrations).

Through the SPOT Portal, businesses can use electronic services to establish a company and carry out other obligatory or frequent procedures, either at start-up or later (submission of forms for social insurance registration, declaration of changes to information on family members, notification of needs for workers, declaration of tax information, etc.). Users can carry out certain procedures independently online, using a valid digital certificate, while for some other more complicated procedures they would need to visit one of the 139 One Stop Shop contact points, the SPOT point or a public notary. </p><p>The main advantages of the SPOT portal are that it enables a free-of-charge sole trader registration usually within one day (in the past it took seven days) and the registration of a company with limited liabilities within three days (in the past it took more than 60 days). It also enables several eServices. </p><p>The majority of services carried out via the SPOT portal or the SPOT points are free of charge. New services are constantly developed for SPOT. In terms of development of new services, relevant stakeholders are being involved and the principles of interoperability are followed. The development is carried out with the cooperation of different governmental bodies. It includes the connection of different IT systems into the eService of SPOT, aiming at reusing already available data from different registries or systems and following the Once-Only principle, where possible.</p><p>In 2020, an important new functionality - the electronic sick leave - was introduced on the portal, which significantly reduced the administrative burden. The estimated cost savings for all participating stakeholders are EUR&#xa0;11.5 million yearly. </p><p>In 2020&#x2013;2021, new electronic services for municipalities were published on the portal, both on the Portal for Citizens eUprava and on the Business Portal SPOT.</p><p>In addition, the portal was visually redesigned in January 2021 to harmonise the user experience and, at the same time, improve the stability of the portal.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">GOV.SI Portal</p><p>With this central platform, it was possible to quickly establish an efficient and central <a href="https://www.gov.si/teme/koronavirus-sars-cov-2/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="digital communication channel" resource="https://www.gov.si/teme/koronavirus-sars-cov-2/">digital communication channel</a> for COVID-19-related information, instructions, data etc. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">NIO - National Interoperability Framework Portal</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Stop the Bureaucracy Website</p><p>The portal also provides information on programme implementation, publishes best practices (at both national and EU levels) and reports on administrative burdens and individual regulations (act, rule, etc.).</p><p>Users (and stakeholders) can submit proposals for reducing the regulatory burden and simplifying procedures.

Each user examines the data using various filters. The data can be exported in a .cvs format, which enables its reuse. Its use is free of charge. The tool is designed to empower the media, civil society organisations and the wider public in their scrutiny of public procurement. When it was launched, the application was well received. Moreover, it helps the media prepare their reports. The application automatically displays, for the chosen timeframe, the ten largest contracting entities and ten largest tenderers in terms of contract value, and the most frequently awarded contracts, according to the subject and legal basis. Each user can use the tool according to their needs using various filters, i.e. search parameters like the contracting authority (name, region where the company has its registered seat), procedure (type of procedure, legal basis, CPV) and tenderer (name, country and region of the company seat). Users can easily add and remove various filters and thus limit or widen the search according to their needs. The data is updated once a day.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eSLOG Standard 2.0</p><ul><li>Transformation of the eInvoice received in the European standard (UBL 2.1 or CEFACT CII syntax) into the new eSLOG standard version 2.0;</li><li>Transformation of the eInvoice received in the new eSLOG standard version 2.0 into the previous eSLOG standard version 1.6; and</li><li>Support the eInvoice visualisation in eSLOG version 2.0.</li></ul><p>From 1 October 2020, budget users can also receive and send eOrder forms, eOrder response and eDespatch advice (eDocuments) in eSLOG standard version 2.0.</p><p>The PPA upgraded the entry point so that it now includes entry points for eDelivery in accordance with the eDelivery AS4 and OpenPEPPOL AS2 profiles, thus enabling budget users to receive eInvoices submitted in the European standard.
