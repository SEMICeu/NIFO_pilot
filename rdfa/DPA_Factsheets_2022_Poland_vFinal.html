The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategy for Responsible Development</p><p>The Strategy for Responsible Development for the period up to 2020 (including the perspective up to 2030) determines basic conditions, objectives and directions for the country development in social, economic, environmental and territorial terms for 2020 and 2030. The main objective of the strategy is to create the conditions for an increase in the income of Polish citizens while improving social, economic, environmental and territorial cohesion. The key indicators of the strategy include the growth of Polish GDP per capita up to 95% of the EU28 average by 2030, and a drop in the risk of poverty and social exclusion indicator to 17 by 2030.</p><p>Ensuring a high and stable growth rate will be facilitated by the implementation of the following measures among others:</p><ul><li>Total investment growth to account for 22-25% of the GDP by 2020 and 25% by 2030;</li><li>Increase in the share of research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures to 1.7% of the GDP by 2020 and 2.5% by 2030;</li><li>Average annual growth rate of exports of 7.2% by 2020 and 6.8% by 2030; and</li><li>A 10% share of advanced technology products in total exports by 2020 and 15% by 2030. </li></ul><p>The main objectives include eGovernment measures, particularly those involving the effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the public administration. The concept of eGovernment and digital public services implies that high-quality services for citizens, including entrepreneurs, are to be provided by modern information technology (IT) solutions supporting a logical and coherent government IT system, developed and maintained with the cooperation of all actors at various levels of public administration.</p><p>A priority task in the field of eGovernment is to allow the widest possible range of public services to be provided digitally, thereby enabling citizens to handle their businesses remotely. To that end, it will be necessary to ensure the interoperability of public IT systems and to computerise the internal processes of the administration.</p><p>In this field, the strategy sets out the following measures:</p><ul><li>Providing eServices relevant for citizens and entrepreneurs;</li><li>Creating a single information and eServices website for the government administration;</li><li>Introducing a uniform and secure system for identifying citizens (eID) in the eServices systems of the public administration;</li><li>Ensuring a dominant share of digital document flow on administration and economic trade;</li><li>Increasing access to public sector information, including through application programming interfaces (APIs) for software developers;</li><li>Adopting a standard for digital documentation management systems in public administration, guaranteeing an efficient exchange of information with the public administration&#x2019;s domain-specific systems; and</li><li>Integrating the eGovernment data processing infrastructure and the development of a State register system, ensuring the necessary reliability and availability of eGovernment systems and their integration.</li></ul><p>Other elements link this strategy to the European Commission&#x2019;s Digital Single Market Strategy, whose implementation is governed and monitored be the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.</p><p>While the implementation of the fundamental objectives of this strategy continues, a certain correction of the specific objectives and mechanisms of the implementation programme has been elaborated in the form of the post-pandemic New Deal Programme, which responds to the changes in the geopolitics and the global economy. The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/polski-lad/polski-lad">programme</a> was announced in the spring of 2021.</p><ul><li>A low fixed broadband coverage;</li><li>A relatively low efficiency of public administration;</li><li>A relatively low level of use of eGovernment; and</li><li>A very low percentage of adults who engage in lifelong learning.</li></ul><p>The report recommended the development of broadband networks, and an improvement in the quality and efficiency of public services through digitalisation. The method for implementing eServices includes mechanisms to prevent the phenomenon of &#x2018;digitalisation bureaucracy&#x2019;, forcing the positive impact of projects on administrative processes, and to train as many people as possible in the use of ICT to improve their quality of life, also socially, and increase the competitiveness of the labour market. </p><p>By the end of 2021, over 1&#xa0;000&#xa0;000 households were connected to high-speed internet. Human capital-related actions resulted in 227&#xa0;540 people trained in using internet, including eServices, and more than 121&#xa0;300 acquiring increased digital competences. In the area of eAdministration, 99 new public eServices and 87 new databases accessible through API were provided. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Integrated State Digitalisation Programme</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-zintegrowanej-informatyzacji-panstwa">Integrated State Digitalisation Programme (PZIP)</a> was adopted in January 2014 and last amended in September 2019.

Three processes were launched:</p><ul><li>Management of the Digital Administration Development, which is a process designed to reduce systems and products&#x2019; complexity, including the Architecture Vision and IT Action Plan;</li><li>Architecture Assurance, which is a process designed to ensure the conformity of projects with the Architecture Vision, the architecture principles and standards, as well as the IT Action Plan; and</li><li>Principles and Standards Management, which is a process to define and maintain the architecture standards and produce a catalogue of standards.</li></ul><p>The work is done in accordance with the European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA) and the European Interoperability Framework (EIF).</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Data Programme </p><p>In February 2021, the Council of Ministers adopted a resolution on the <a href="https://monitorpolski.gov.pl/MP/2021/290">Open Data Programme 2021&#x2013;2027.</a> It is the follow-up document to the first governmental document dedicated to opening public data, the Open Data Programme 2016&#x2013;2020.  </p><p>The document defines the priorities of the government in opening access to data. The Open Data Programme aims to develop an ecosystem in which a large amount of good quality data will allow for the development of innovative solutions, increase the transparency of the activities of administrative bodies and increase the quality of research, accelerating scientific progress.</p><p>In 2019, as a continuation of the project &#x2018;Open data - access, standard, education&#x2019; a new project called Open Data Plus was inaugurated. Under the project, new datasets are released through API and two new tools are established within the Chancellery of the Prime Minister to support the opening of public data, i.e. the Open Data Laboratory (technical and legal advice) and the Open Data Academy (trainings).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Data Standards</p><p>Opening public data makes public administration activities more transparent and allows civic control thereover. In 2018, the former Ministry for Digital Affairs (now the Chancellery of the Prime Minister) published <a href="https://dane.gov.pl/knowledge-base/education/1220">guidelines</a> to prepare and share data for reuse. The guidelines concerned the API standard, the security standard, the technical standard and the legal standard. The Ministry for Digital Affairs elaborated them as part of the project &#x2018;Open data &#x2013; access, standard, education&#x2019; to ensure that data provided by the public administration would be of a higher quality. Open data may now be reused for research or business purposes. </p><p>In 2019, open data standards were subject to extensive public consultations. Most of the proposals submitted during the consultations were implemented in the new versions of the documents published in 2020. This will trigger an increase in the quality of data provided by the administration and used in innovative products and services.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>The strategy defines five specific objectives that should be fulfilled by the government: </p><ul><li>Developing the national cybersecurity system (including the adoption of the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act into the Polish legal system); </li><li>Increasing the level of resilience of information systems of the public administration and private sector, and achieving the capacity to effectively prevent and respond to incidents; </li><li>Increasing the national capacity in the area of cybersecurity technology; </li><li>Raising public awareness and competences in the area of cybersecurity; and</li><li>Ensuring the Republic of Poland has a strong international position in the area of cybersecurity.</li></ul><p>In addition, the strategy is in line with the obligations laid down in the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive with regard to the adoption of the national cybersecurity strategies by Member States. Lastly, it establishes an effective public-private partnership (Programme for Cooperation in Cybersecurity) with global and national technological companies that aims to strengthen the cooperation in areas such as information sharing on incidents or vulnerabilities, education, cyber hygiene, etc.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Efficient State Strategy 2020 </p><p>According to the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WMP20130000136">Efficient State Strategy 2020</a>, high interoperability of all IT systems and public registers is a fundamental condition for the implementation of common standards for electronic communication in the public sector and for the provision of reference data for current office work. The possibility of automatic verification of data provided by persons using public services with reference data from public registers will allow to improve the current work of public entities, which are obliged to perform the tasks specified in the law, and at the same time will speed up the settlement of matters. </p><p>The Personal Data Registry (PESEL) shall be a reference set of data about citizens. It is necessary to introduce and enforce principles for limiting to the necessary minimum the range of data which will be required from the citizen when dealing with official matters. Units keeping registers must have the obligation of mutual exchange of information and direct information requests from registered entities should only be possible if the data obtained from other records are insufficient. Since 1 January 2022, government administration bodies, as well as law enforcement bodies, courts, organisational units of the prosecutor&#x2019;s office, local government units and their bodies that keep a public register using ICT systems have to verify the data entered with the data in PESEL.</p><p>Two-way communication between secondary and primary records (supplied directly with data obtained from the registered entities) should be provided. A modern and secure IT infrastructure, built on robust integrated tele-information systems, is now the basis for the functioning of offices and the exchange of information between offices and citizens, as well as the offices themselves and other public bodies.</p><p>Currently, the government is programming the new Efficient and Modern State Strategy 2030.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eProcurement Project 2020&#x2013;2026</p><p>The Ministry of Economic Development and Technology is currently working on the development of an eProcurement project in partnership with the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.

It granted citizens and businesses the right to contact public authorities electronically. It also set up horizontal/infrastructure programmes for all sectors of public administration and established a national interoperability framework for IT systems in the Polish public sector. </p><p>This law was essential for the standardisation and interoperability of public administration systems, front and back-office integration of public administration systems, in particular the <a href="https://epuap.gov.pl/wps/portal/english">Electronic Platform of Public Administration Services (ePUAP)</a>, the central repository of electronic document templates, and the supervision and support of IT projects in public administration at both central and local levels.

The IKP is developed with the purpose of creating a single point of access where a patient can find all relevant information regarding one&#x2019;s health status. It allows the patient to have electronic access to their treatment history and electronic medical records, to ePrescriptions and to eReferrals, and gives the possibility to authorise other persons, including medical staff, to have access to the patient&#x2019;s account. Via the IKP, a patient can also submit the choice of the general practitioner or apply for an Electronic Health Insurance Card. Other functionalities related to the coronavirus (eRegistration for vaccination, EU Digital COVID Certificate, etc.) are also available. The mobile version of the IKP was released in May 2021 and contains the ePrescription and eReferral functionalities, as well as the EU Digital COVID Certificate. In the first quarter of 2021, the active users of the IKP totalled over 6 million; by the end of the same year, the number had increased to over 14 million.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Legislation Centre</p><p>Since April 2011, various Polish legal acts have been transmitted to the <a href="https://www.rcl.gov.pl" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="government legislation centre" resource="https://www.rcl.gov.pl">Government Legislation Centre</a> in electronic form only, using the eGovernment portal Electronic Platform of Public Administration Services.

The aim of the Ministry for Digital Affairs was to develop an app that serves as a digital wallet to store documents that are often used by citizens in everyday life, such as ID cards, driver&#x2019;s licenses, student ID cards, etc., but also to provide services such as up-to-date information about one&#x2019;s vehicle, information for travellers about other countries or redemption of ePrescriptions. The services provided by mObywatel are the result of cooperation between the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, and many public and private institutions.</p><p>In 2021, additional documents and services were added: the validation of the COVID-19 vaccination document was introduced in March and the EU Digital COVID Certificate, confirming vaccination, a negative COVID-19 test and/or recovery from COVID-19, was also integrated in June, followed by the Lesser Polish Agglomeration Card, the Train Tickets Service, Extended Family and the Railwayman&#x2019;s ID.</p><p>At the end of 2020, the number of application users amounted to over 2 million. As of the beginning of July 2021, the app had been downloaded more than 4 million times, with downloads reaching more than 7 million at the beginning of March 2022.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Trusted Profile</p><p>The Trusted Profile is a public eID means based on an immaterial unit containing personal identification data. It is a special online account provided by the Chancellery of the Prime Minister. This solution can also be used to submit a free online signature in a public service called &#x2018;trusted signature&#x2019;. This is a specific signature which includes a person&#x2019;s identification data taken from an eID means which is issued under the public eID scheme. The authenticity and integrity of this signature are ensured by the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, which seals signed data using an advanced electronic seal based on a qualified certificate. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Qualified Trust Service Providers</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ID Card with Electronic Layer</p><p>The eID card is a secure tool containing certificates enabling electronic identification (an eID means called personal profile) and the creation of an advanced electronic signature (called personal signature). It may contain a qualified electronic signature from a trust service provider (chosen by the holder). Moreover, the ICAO application is also implemented in the ID card.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Electronic Identification Node</p><p>The <a href="https://login.gov.pl/login/main" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="national electronic identification node" resource="https://login.gov.pl/login/main">National Electronic Identification Node</a> provides convenient access to public portals and eServices. It is an organisational and technical solution that integrates IT systems at a single point in which public online services are made available, with various eID schemes (provided by public or private entities). Users using eID means issued in eID schemes connected to the National Electronic Identification Node can authenticate in any public online services. </p><p>Video Chat as a Form of Identity Authentication </p><p>In 2020, 37&#xa0;558 TPZs were confirmed via video chat. Due to the popularity of this eService and in order to meet the expectations of citizens, in 2021 identity authentication by means of video-verification became one of the methods to also confirm a traditional Trusted Profile, which is valid for three years. This is a significant step in the development of the Polish system of identity authentication.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Commercial Certification Authorities Certificates</p><p>Qualified and unqualified certification authorities (CAs) issue electronic identifiers to individual persons. These identifiers are usually Integrated Circuit Cards (ICC) with crypto-controller, private cryptographic keys and public key certificates installed inside or software-based tokens. In the case of eGovernment systems and applications, the most frequently used identifiers are the ones with qualified public key certificates. Electronic signatures with unqualified certificates are rarely used, and their use is mainly limited to message authentication, and authentication of servers, workstations and other IT equipment.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Commercial eSignatures</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Procurement Office Portal</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Information on the Polish Public Procurement System</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing Infrastructure</p><p>eInvoicing within the eProcurement area is managed by the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology in cooperation with the &#x141;ukasiewicz - Pozna&#x144; Institute of Technology.

So far, Polish citizens have been able to use the eID means connected to the national node only in national eServices. Foreign nationals whose eIDAS node is integrated with the Polish eIDAS node can use their notified national eID in selected Polish eServices. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Single Point of Contact</p><p>The Single Point of Contact is a communication interface (node) between Schengen Member States or associated States. It allows for effective online communication, leading to regular implementation of tasks related to the exchange of cryptographic keys. In general, it will be used to exchange certificates between all countries of the Schengen area, which will enable the competent services (most often the Border Guard) to verify travel documents (usually passports). Suspicious persons (or suspects) will be subject to further verification of fingerprints with imprints placed in the document.</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">System of State Registers </p><p>The System of State Registers combines six registers: PESEL, the Registry of Civil Status, the Registry of ID Cards, the System of State Awards, the Central Registry of Objections and the Registry of Contact Information.
