The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategy for Public Governance Renewal</p><p>In the framework of the Strategy for Public Governance and Services of Prime Minister Sanna Marin&#x2019;s Government Programme, the Finnish government released in December 2020 its <a href="https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/162573">Strategy for Public Governance Renewal</a>. This strategy will guide and strengthen the renewal of public governance as a whole from 2020 to 2030. A consistent and determined renewal of governance as described in the strategy will streamline everyday services, ensure legal certainty in society, and create new opportunities for business and communities. The strategy seeks to strengthen good governance across the country and in both national languages. More specifically, it strives to improve digital accessibility and encourage wider use of plain language in administration.</p><p>The direction and means of administrative reform were defined together with various administrative sectors, municipalities, civil society, researchers and numerous stakeholders to agree on the goals and future policies around public governance in the 2020s. The participatory process of preparing the strategy has therefore played an important role in strengthening cooperation between the State, municipalities and future welfare regions as well as the interaction between governance and the rest of society, and in building a common understanding of the need and direction of public governance development.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Climate and Environment Strategy for the ICT Sector</p><p>The strategy approaches the climate and environment aspects of the ICT sector from two perspectives. On the one hand, communication networks, data centres and smart devices consume electricity and materials. The ICT sector consumes an estimated 4&#x2011;10% of global electric power and gives rise to some 3&#x2013;5% of greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the ICT sector has a great deal of potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors, such as transport. For instance, digital services enable intelligent transport control and make public transport more attractive by streamlining vehicle changes. Also, the coronavirus pandemic has shown in practice how teleworking and teleconferencing can replace passenger transportation.</p><p>The strategy will be implemented by a wide range of parties, both public and private. The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency (Traficom) will monitor implementation of the strategy in partnership with stakeholders. An annual forum will be arranged to support this process.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Programme of Prime Minister Marin </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Government Action Plan </p><p>The IV <a href="https://avoinhallinto.fi/en/home/" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Finnish Open Government Action Plan (2019&#x2013;2023</a><span resource="https://avoinhallinto.fi/en/home/" property="dct:title" content="Finnish Open Government Action Plan (2019&#x2013;2023"/>) emphasises openness and inclusion in three different dimensions: (i) openness as a shared value; (ii) a strong legal foundation to openness; and (iii) the continuous development of openness.

The Parliament approved the report in March 2019 with four statements. In addition, the Parliament obliged the government to continue its work on ethical information policy and artificial intelligence and to formulate them in more concrete terms. It also required the government to take the necessary actions to increase citizens&#x2019; understanding of digitisation and artificial intelligence, and strengthen the human competence in these matters at different educational levels and in different scientific branches. </p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act on the Openness of Government Activities </p><p>The Ministry of Justice will update the <a href="https://oikeusministerio.fi/en/act-on-the-openness-of-government-activities" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Act on the Openness of Government Activities</a><span resource="https://oikeusministerio.fi/en/act-on-the-openness-of-government-activities" property="dct:title" content="Act on the Openness of Government Activities"/> according to the Government Programme to extend its application to data and information more broadly.

Strategic development focuses on strategic management and the promotion of procurement skills. Information management and impact assessment support strategic management. At the heart of the development work is the acquisition of functional and high-quality products and services so that all parties are involved in the process and the market is vibrant. Innovation can be generated as part of public procurement.

The AuroraAI network aims to enable smooth interaction and communication between different services and platforms as the AI Programme&#x2019;s report of 2017 suggested. Breaking down silos that continue to affect parts of the current service provision, the AuroraAI network aims to enable AI to facilitate interaction between services and to improve the match between users and public services while tackling inefficiency and resource waste. The purpose of AuroraAI is to create the technical conditions that enable information exchange and interoperability between different services and platforms.</p><p>In addition to the AuroraAI network, the programme is developing a service model to arrange public services in a way that they can support people in their life events and organisations in their business activities, in collaboration with service providers in other sectors. The third main product of the programme is the new skills and competence development programme that will be set up to support the service model during the deployment phase and later on. </p><p>The aim of the programme is to deploy the AuroraAI network and the service model for different life situations and events by the end of 2022.</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-440.jpeg" alt="35-440.jpeg" class="keepElement"/></p><p>	 Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><p>4</p><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/legalframework/Finland" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2>Specific legislation on digital public administration</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Information Management in Public Administration Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190906" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Information Management in Public Administration Act (906/2019)</a><span resource="https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190906" property="eli:title" content="Information Management in Public Administration Act (906/2019)"/> entered into force on 1 January 2020.
