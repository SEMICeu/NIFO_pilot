The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Hungary in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring"><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Norway&#x2019;s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall very good implementation of the EIF Principles. Regarding principle 2 (openness), we can see that the implementation of the recommendations has led to an increase in the score from 3 to 4 in 2022. Possible areas of improvements are concentrated in Principles 7 (Inclusion and accessibility) and 9 (Multilingualism) and for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure that public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 &#x2013; Recommendation 14) and the implementation of information systems and IT architecture that caters for multiple languages based on the needs of the end user in the design of European public services (Principle 9 &#x2013; Recommendation 16) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring"><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Norwegian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall very good performance with scores of 4 for all layers. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country&#x2019;s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are in the area of interoperability governance; integrated public service governance, and organisational interoperability. More specifically, the overall score of 3 for Norway in Recommendation 22, stating that public administrations should use a structured, objective and transparent approach when choosing standards and specifications, could be improved. The same can be said for the overall score of 3 for Recommendation 29, stating that public administrations should clarify and formalise organisational relationships for establishing and operating European public services. However, it is important to note that while greater efforts could be focused on Recommendation 22 and 29, the lower score of 3 does not negatively impact the overall interoperability governance score for Norway.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring"><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Norway&#x2019;s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a very good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with all criteria. It is interesting to note that Norway has an above-EU average score of 4 for the implementation of recommendations associated with security and privacy and external information sources and services. As far as Catalogues is concerned, the implementation of the recommendations has led to a rise from a score of 3 to a score of 4, which is above the European average. However, it is possible to make a slight improvement by focusing on setting up a catalogue of public services, data and interoperability solutions, each with common models to describe them (Recommendation 44). It should be added that a score of 3 for one of the KPIs in recommendation 44 has no negative impact on the recommendation&apos;s score and Norway&apos;s overall score for catalogues.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring"><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Norway concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard show a very good performance of the country in 16 indicators. However, Norway has still margin for improvement. For instance, efforts could focus on the development of a shared infrastructure of reusable services and information sources that can be used by all public administrations (i.e. Internal information sources and services &#x2013; Recommendation 36) in order to match the EU average. It is also possible to improve by focusing on using information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service.

The Digital Agenda has two key objectives: ensuring a user-centric and efficient public administration and achieving value creation and inclusion with digital services. </p><p>The newly adopted strategy has five key priorities:</p><ul><li>A user centric focus;</li><li>ICT should constitute a significant input factor for innovation and productivity;</li><li>Strengthened digital competence and inclusion;</li><li>An effective digitisation of the public sector; and</li><li>Sound data protection and information security.</li></ul><p>The effective use of ICT is essential to ensure continued economic growth and a high level of employment in Norway. Through the purposeful use of ICT, the policy aims to provide the public with a growing number of digital services. Digital self-service solutions will help improve service quality, availability and flexibility for users.</p><p>Advanced use of ICT in business and public sectors depends on a good infrastructure (broadband) and a sufficient knowledge of ICT within the population. It is important that technological solutions are accessible to everyone, including the visually and hearing impaired. In addition, to achieve the objectives of ICT policy, the research and development of ICT and advanced ICT skills needs to be strengthened.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">One Digital Public Sector: Digital Strategy for the Public Sector 2019&#x2013;2025</p><p>The <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/one-digital-public-sector/id2653874/">Digital Strategy for the Public Sector</a>, launched in June 2019, establishes the common goals and focus areas for digitalisation activities towards 2025. It supports digital transformation throughout the public sector. The strategy&#x2019;s main measures focus on a user-centric service development and more efficient and coordinated utilisation of common IT solutions. This is achieved by developing a common ecosystem for digital cooperation in the public sector. The strategy requires that cybersecurity be integrated into common IT solution services development, operation and management, in accordance with the objectives of the National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway. Therefore, the main goals for 2025 aim to: </p><ul><li>Achieve the digitalisation of the public sector in a transparent, inclusive and trustworthy way;</li><li>Perform more tasks digitally as well as the delivery of services;</li><li>Encourage citizens, businesses and voluntary organisations to communicate digitally with the public sector;</li><li>Exploit the sharing and using of data to create user-friendly services and to promote value creation for businesses; </li><li>Help local and central government agencies to develop their services based on a common digital ecosystem for cooperation; and</li><li>Help local and central government agencies to gain from digitalisation in a systematic manner.</li></ul><p>The Action Plan accompanying this strategy is coordinated by the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Throughout Life</p><p>In September 2021, the Ministry of Local government and Regional Development published a <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/8f8751780e9749bfa8946526b51f10f4/digital_throughout_life.pdf">national strategy</a> to improve digital participation and competence among the population. The goal of the strategy is to prevent digital exclusion and provide what the population needs to be able to use the digital tools and services society depends upon today. Everyone should be able to participate in society, in democratic processes and in social communities by using digital tools.</p><p>The strategy focuses on several challenges such as digital vulnerability, the digital divide and exclusion. The government aims are:</p><ul><li>To help prevent digital exclusion in all age groups;</li><li>To facilitate free, quality-assured assistance services for citizens with little or no digital competence;</li><li>To further develop the partnership with KS (Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities) to facilitate the development of good, local guidance services throughout the country;</li><li>To hold the business sector more accountable for including all citizens in the digital services they provide;</li><li>To help ensure that, as a rule, publicly funded low-threshold services aimed at people with little or no digital competence are free;</li><li>To ensure regular mapping of citizens&#x2019; level of digital competence;</li><li>To work together with public, private and voluntary providers on a campaign to encourage citizens who need to improve their digital competence to register for courses; and</li><li>To consider whether one public agency should be assigned overarching responsibility for coordinating national efforts to improve the population&#x2019;s digital competence.</li></ul><p>The strategy has some focus areas:</p><ul><li>Internet access (the digital foundation);</li><li>Available ICT equipment;</li><li>Basic digital skills;</li><li>User friendly digital services;</li><li>Digital judgement (ability to reflect and think critically); and</li><li>Other measures (guidance, user input).</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">White Paper on an Innovative Public Sector (Report.

The premise of the strategy is one person, one identity in Norway. </p><p>The main goals for eID and trust services are laid out in the <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/one-digital-public-sector/id2653874/">One Digital Public Sector</a> strategy. It states that all citizens should have an eID that can be used for the services they need. All groups, including foreign nationals without a Norwegian national identity number, children and adolescents, should be able to obtain an eID at the level they need. Individuals who are unable to act digitally themselves, must have the opportunity to be represented by a proxy. Provisions must therefore be made for the use of digital authorisations and digital consent. There is also a need to facilitate the use of electronic employee IDs. Guidelines for the use of eID for employees in public administration has been subject to <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/horing-veileder-for-bruk-av-eid-for-ansatte-i-offentlig-forvaltning/id2949484/">consultation</a>.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security Aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>On 30 January 2019, a new <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/national-cyber-security-strategy-for-norway/id2627177/">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> was released by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security and the Ministry of Defence.

No specific time frame was applied as the government committed to progressively adjust it in line with technological and social developments. It states that Norway should take the lead in developing and using AI while respecting individual rights and freedoms.</p><p>The AI Strategy takes as a starting point the fact that Norway is well positioned for succeeding with AI. Indeed, Norway has:</p><ul><li>A high level of public trust in both business and public sectors;</li><li>A digitally competent population and business sector;</li><li>An excellent infrastructure and high-quality registry data that span over many decades;</li><li>Well-developed e-Governance and public agencies that have come a long way with digitalisation and that have the capacity and expertise to experiment with new technologies; and</li><li>Tripartite cooperation between employers, unions and government, which facilitates cooperation when restructuring is necessary.</li></ul><p>The strategy goes on to highlight that:</p><ul><li>AI developed and used in Norway should be built on ethical principles, and respect human rights and democracy;</li><li>Research, development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) in Norway should promote responsible and trustworthy AI;</li><li>Development and use of AI in Norway should safeguard the integrity and privacy of the individual; and</li><li>Cybersecurity should be built into the development, operation and administration of systems that use AI.</li></ul><p>Supervisory authorities should make sure that AI systems in their areas of supervision are operated in accordance with the principles for responsible and trustworthy use of AI. </p><p><a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/nasjonal-strategi-for-kunstig-intelligens/id2685594/">https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/nasjonal-strategi-for-kunstig-intelligens/id2685594/</a>The strategy outlines the importance of regulatory sandbox initiatives as tools in the Norwegian public administration. One example is the ongoing cooperation between the <a href="https://www.arkivverket.no/en">National Archival Service</a> and the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency, where participants in the initiative are being challenged to find new and innovative ways of combining documentation management, freedom of information and personal data protection. Another example is the cooperation between the <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/">Data Protection Agency</a> and the <a href="https://www.nav.no/en/home">Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV)</a>, which aims to stimulate innovation of ethical and responsible AI, with extra attention being paid to personal data protection. This latter initiative focusses on the specific use case of workers who need to take sick leave and helps the Labour and Welfare Administration identify people who need specific attention in a more targeted way.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Declaration on AI in the Nordic-Baltic Region</p><p>In May 2018, the Ministers responsible for digital development from Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden, and the &#xc5;land Islands released a <a href="https://www.norden.org/en/declaration/ai-nordic-baltic-region">Declaration on AI in the Nordic-Baltic Region</a>.

It regulates the type of entities to be registered and the information to be recorded, the relationship with the affiliated registries, the notifications to the registry, the registration, the inspection of messages, and the exchange and disclosure of information. Private businesses have access to public information through the commercial distributor. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Land Registry	</p><p>The <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/act-land-registration/id455461/" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law on Land Registration </a><span resource="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/act-land-registration/id455461/" property="eli:title" content="Law on Land Registration "/>and the <a href="https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2005-06-17-101" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law on Cadastre </a><span resource="https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2005-06-17-101" property="eli:title" content="Law on Cadastre "/>regulate the operation of the Land Registry and the Cadastre.
