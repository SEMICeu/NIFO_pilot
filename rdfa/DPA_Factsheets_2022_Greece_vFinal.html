The newly deployed infrastructure will bring significant new capabilities to the market in terms of broadband service availability and capacity, speed, and the level of competition. In particular, the notified measure aims to ensure 100Mbps availability to most of the covered area, exceeding 98% of the active lines and 75% of the settlements, while ensuring gigabit upgradability.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.digitalplan.gov.gr/dimosievma/47/wifi4gr-anaptyxi-dimosion-simeion-asyrmatis-evryzonikis-prosvasis-sto-diadiktyo/">WiFi4GR</a> project, with a EUR 15 million budget, is subject to a framework agreement for the supply, installation, configuration, and operation of 5&#xa0;600 wireless access points that will be installed in 2&#xa0;500 areas across the country over the period of three years.

The purpose of the Hellenic Open Data Portal is to increase the web accessibility of Greek public administration datasets by providing integrated services, e.g. cataloguing, indexing, storage, search and availability of public sector data and information, as well as online services to citizens and third-party information systems. The implementation of a new version of the portal is in progress to improve the technical features and functions of the data repository but also to provide a quality upgrade to the information. Special emphasis is placed on the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) both in terms of availability and reception of datasets.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Register of Bodies granted by the Public Sector</p><p>The <a href="https://ppp.eaadhsy.gr/index.php/el/?option=com_sppagebuilder&amp;view=page&amp;id=7" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="register of bodies granted by the public sector" resource="https://ppp.eaadhsy.gr/index.php/el/?option=com_sppagebuilder&amp;view=page&amp;id=7">Register of Bodies granted by the Public Sector</a> contains information concerning the expenses of non-profit entities that receive funding from General Government Entities (amounting to EUR 3&#xa0;000 or more per year).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Diavgeia &#x2013; Transparency Portal</p><p>Within the framework of the principle of open action of the administration, the enhancement of transparency and accountability is sought by extending the scope of the Transparency Programme by further obliging to post the expenses accounts of non-profit organisations that are subsidised by the General Government with an amount of more than EUR 3&#xa0;000 euro in total per year at the Register of Bodies granted by the Public Sector (failing to publish the above statements leads to exclusion from any kind of further grant or financing). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">emvolio.gov.gr</p><p>The SARS-COV-2 virus poses a major threat to public health as it causes significant morbidity and mortality in certain groups of the population.
