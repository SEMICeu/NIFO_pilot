The law intends to simplify procedures and formalities that service providers need to comply with. In particular, it requires that unjustified and disproportionate burdens be removed in order to foster the establishment of businesses and the cross-border provision of services. The law also strengthens the rights of the recipients of such services and prohibits discriminatory conditions based on the nationality or the place of residence of the service recipient (e.g. discriminatory tariffs).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on Information Society Services</p><p>The <a href="https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.8A719A97956F/asr" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law on Information Society Services</a><span resource="https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.8A719A97956F/asr" property="eli:title" content="Law on Information Society Services"/> was adopted in May 2006 to ensure the implementation of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Directive 2000/31/EC on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular on electronic commerce in the Internal Market (eCommerce Directive)</a><span resource="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML" property="eli:title" content="Directive 2000/31/EC on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular on electronic commerce in the Internal Market (eCommerce Directive)"/>. The main purpose was to establish legal grounds to regulate the provision of information society services. The law defines the requirements for the information provided and the conclusion of agreements by electronic means, regulates the responsibilities, rights/duties and activities of service providers, and establishes the means for dispute resolution. The law also protects the freedom to provide information society services towards a party established outside the country. Restrictions may apply in certain cases, such as intellectual property rights, the freedom of choice of the law applicable to a contract, and others.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big data</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud computing</h3><p>Governmental Resolutions on Cloud Computing</p><p>The use of cloud computing is regulated by the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania of 2015 on the Approval of the Consolidation of the State IT Infrastructure and the Optimisation of IT Management.
