The goal of the current strategy is to guide the country&apos;s eGovernment progress in the coming years. The strategy has been developed in cooperation with a broad spectrum of stakeholders from the fields of administration, politics, science and business.&#xa0;</p><p>The NEGS aims to ensure a common orientation for eGovernment activities and efforts at federal, State and local levels in order to establish an attractive eGovernment and IT approach for citizens and businesses.&#xa0;According to the new vision&#xa0;enshrined in the&#xa0;strategy, eGovernment should be characterised by&#xa0;five&#xa0;principles:</p><ul><li>Usefulness for citizens, businesses and public administration:&#xa0;potential eGovernment users should be fully aware of the services offered to them and be able to access them. In particular, broadband access in rural areas should be improved as well as citizens&apos; digital/media&#xa0;literacy;&#xa0;&#xa0;</li><li>Cost-effectiveness and efficiency:&#xa0;in order&#xa0;for&#xa0;the public administration to provide rapid, cost-effective&#xa0;and high-quality services, process chains within the public administration should be supported by electronic means&#xa0;and designed following a customer-centric approach. The various processes will be&#xa0;digitalised, with the&#xa0;federal&#xa0;government and the States putting the appropriate legal, organisational and technical instruments in place for ensuring the mandatory use of digital&#xa0;technologies; </li><li>Data&#xa0;protection, cyber security and transparency:&#xa0;data protection, security and transparency constitute important preconditions for the citizens to accept, trust and intensively use eGovernment. Therefore, the NEGS aims at ensuring data transparency and security by paying attention to only collect and process the data that is&#xa0;absolutely necessary&#xa0;for providing a particular administrative service. In addition, the protection of the providing systems is vital for the acceptance of eGovernment&#xa0;services;&#xa0;</li><li>Social&#xa0;participation and transparency:&#xa0;the&#xa0;active participation of citizens and businesses in policy as well as in planning and decision-making processes is fostered, as far as it is reasonable and allowed by law.&#xa0;The impact and&#xa0;the&#xa0;results of&#xa0;the&#xa0;participation should be made transparent to citizens and&#xa0;businesses; and</li><li>Innovation and sustainability:&#xa0;federal, State and local public administrations will support the capacity for innovation and openness to change through their own high-performance and client-oriented eGovernment offerings.&#xa0;</li></ul><p>The NEGS also contains&#xa0;six key principles&#xa0;that new legislation and initiatives should consider: </p><ul><li>Citizens and businesses&#xa0;should be able to carry out&#xa0;as many&#xa0;operations&#xa0;as possible from the same point of access, regardless of time and&#xa0;location;&#xa0;</li><li>Authorities should be able to cooperate quickly across different levels to minimise the administrative burden for citizens, businesses and public administration,&#xa0;e.g.&#xa0;by providing spatial data via the Spatial Data Infrastructure Germany initiative (GDI-DE); </li><li>Citizens and businesses should know which public authorities process their personal data. They should be confident that eGovernment is&#xa0;secure;&#xa0;</li><li>Citizens&#xa0;should be able to&#xa0;use electronic media to participate actively in the policy process and in organising the provision of public&#xa0;services;&#xa0;</li><li>The&#xa0;public administration should use cooperation models with the business and research community when developing and operating eGovernment solutions.&#xa0;This&#xa0;will enable innovative business models, through online services and&#xa0;information;&#xa0;and</li><li>Information security management&#xa0;should&#xa0;lead to a high level of IT security for eGovernment procedures and guarantee data confidentiality, integrity and availability.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Memorandum for the National eGovernment Strategy </p><p>At its fifth&#xa0;meeting on&#xa0;30 June 2011, the IT Planning Council took the first concrete steps towards the implementation of the National eGovernment Strategy, by publishing a&#xa0;memorandum, which outlines the agreed strategic goals. The focus was placed on building a federal infrastructure and aligning individual measurements. According to the memorandum, IT planning envisages the following priorities to be addressed: </p><ul><li>Transparent government and regulatory actions should be promoted by appropriate measures of IT and&#xa0;eGovernment; </li><li>Federal and State governments need to adapt to the IT processes and current threats from the&#xa0;internet. Therefore, minimum uniform standards for communication between government departments should be&#xa0;developed; </li><li>Develop a common&#xa0;eID&#xa0;strategy to enable citizens and businesses to securely transact with the administration over the internet. In this regard, the notification procedure to the European Commission for the German&#xa0;eID&#xa0;was fully finalised in 2017. As reported by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), &#x201c;the German&#xa0;eID&#xa0;fulfils all requirement of&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Level of Assurance high&#x201d;;&#xa0;</li><li>A&#xa0;federal information management system will bring together knowledge management faster and more efficiently to improve public&#xa0;services; </li><li>Sharing initiatives&#xa0;involving&#xa0;federal,&#xa0;State and local governments must be developed to save costs on IT-infrastructure;&#xa0;</li><li>The definition of IT security and IT interoperability standards is one of the main tasks of the IT Planning&#xa0;Board; and</li><li>The framework for levels across eGovernment should be further developed. The IT planning supports the coordinated activities of the federal and&#xa0;State laws to further adjust the regulatory framework.&#xa0;</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">IT Consolidation Programme of the German Federal Government&#xa0;</p><p>The German cabinet decided in&#xa0;the&#xa0;summer 2015 to substantially modernise the federal&#xa0;government in the IT department.&#xa0;Consolidating&#xa0;IT at federal level&#xa0;will serve several aims, namely:&#xa0;ensure information security in an increasingly complex&#x202f;IT&#x202f;environment; maintain sovereignty and control over federal IT&#x202f;also in the future; respond swiftly to technological innovations; ensure effective, efficient, stable and future-proof operations; and&#xa0;enable the government&#xa0;to&#xa0;remain an attractive employer for&#x202f;IT&#x202f;experts. Data of the federal administration must be comprehensively protected and secured against misuse. Until 2022,&#x202f;IT&#x202f;consolidation will follow three lines of action: consolidating operations, consolidating services, and centralising procurement.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">IT Strategy of the Federal Administration&#xa0;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.cio.bund.de/Web/DE/Strategische-Themen/IT-Strategie-Bund/it_strategie_bund_node.html">IT Strategy of the Federal Administration</a> (<em>IT-Strategie&#xa0;der&#xa0;Bundesverwaltung</em>)&#xa0;defines ten cross-departmental goals for strategic&#xa0;IT&#xa0;development.&#xa0;With six overarching fields of action, the strategy sets priorities for the further development of IT and thus forms the basis for prioritising existing and future IT measures. To this end, the federal administration&apos;s IT strategy&#xa0;takes into account&#xa0;specifications and decisions at&#xa0;European&#xa0;as well as at&#xa0;national level.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Data Strategy of the German Federal Government </p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Once-Only Principle </p><p>Citizens:&#xa0;</p><ul><li>More transparency:&#xa0;citizens can track in their user accounts which authority has queried their data;&#xa0;</li><li>Quick notices: faster administrative services through interoperable data exchange;&#xa0;</li><li>Proactive eGovernment&#xa0;services: the offer of proactive eGovernment&#xa0;services without time-consuming applications can be increased by reusing citizen&#xb4;s data;&#xa0;and</li><li>Administrative burden: reduce administrative burden as citizens only have to submit data once.&#xa0;</li></ul><p>Administration<strong>:</strong>&#xa0;</p><ul><li>Efficiency gain: faster and more efficient processing thanks to simplified data exchange;&#xa0;</li><li>Networking: closer exchange of knowledge between administrations through co-creation and collaboration;&#xa0;</li><li>Growth dynamics: a dynamic European single market thanks to lower barriers between States; and&#xa0;</li><li>Validity: valid, forgery-proof, high-qualitydata from an authentic source.&#xa0;</li></ul><p>In March 2021, the IT Planning Council published a roadmap on &#x2018;Modernisation of registers: vision and implementation planning&#x2019;.

It will be achieved by making the legislative process at the federal level completely electronic, interoperable, and free of media discontinuity. At the same time, the process orientates itself towards current technological developments, e.g. by providing LegalDocML.de, a data standard for regulatory measures, and user-friendly applications. These applications are integrated into a collaborative platform that enables, for instance, to draw up timetables for regulatory projects or to initiate in-house and interdepartmental votes.

European provisions &#x2013; in particular the Single Digital Gateway (SDG) Regulation&#xa0;&#x2013; oblige the German authorities to put the so-called Once-Only principle into practice. The act introduces a unique, trans-sectoral identification number in the German administration in line with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). The legislation also provides changes in the German fiscal code and other technical items of legislation to enable the processing of the identification number in order to provide administrative services in line with the Online Access Act. The implementation of the legislation is embedded in a roadmap for a modernised register landscape adopted by the federal government and the <em>l&#xe4;nder</em>.</p><p>The roadmap presents a systematic approach to modernising the German register landscape. The key component of a modern register landscape is its technical architecture, which should comply with the existing applications and standards of the IT Planning Council. It must be expanded in accordance with the legislative provisions already set out in the German Register Modernisation Act (<em>Registermodernisierungsgesetz, RegMoG</em>) and must guarantee not only implementation of the Once-Only principle (OOP) in Germany, but also a connection to the Once-Only system at European level. Examples of needs-based technical infrastructure expansion might include a central directory of types of evidence and interfaces enabling connectivity between existing registers. The focus of these development efforts should be on strengthening interoperability within Germany and achieving convergence with European technologies.</p><p>Furthermore, the roadmap points out that the technical architecture should not be the only focus of development; the registers themselves should be developed further with a view to ensuring that they meet minimum connectivity and data management requirements. The federal government should both provide technical and methodological backing and create incentives for the necessary work by registration bodies in this area. Academic expertise should also be drawn upon, particularly as regards data quality and the potential of register data.

Beyond upgrading existing registers, it is also important to examine the opportunities that exist for establishing new registers, in particular a building and housing register and an education register. The research community should be involved at an early stage when planning and implementing register-based census-taking and when scrutinising new registers such as the education register.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services </p><p>On 18 August 2017, the&#xa0;<a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ozg/BJNR313800017.html" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services&#xa0;</a><span resource="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ozg/BJNR313800017.html" property="eli:title" content="Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services&#xa0;"/>(<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG) entered into force. The federal, regional and local levels of government&#xa0;are&#xa0;now required to take comprehensive measures in order to promote electronic government services.&#xa0;Core requirements include:&#xa0;</p><ul><li>All (suitable) administrative services must be available online within five years after the law&#x2019;s entry into&#xa0;force;&#xa0;</li><li>Federal and municipal eGovernment services must be available both through a newly created federal online portal and the online portals of the&#xa0;federal States<em>&#xa0;(L&#xe4;nder)</em>. All portals are meant be connected to a network of portals, the&#xa0;<em>Portalverbund</em>. Thus, access to electronic government services becomes easier and more&#xa0;user-friendly; and</li><li>Access to all administrative services in the portal network must be allowed via a secure single-user account.

The German law for the promotion of eGovernment came into effect on 1 August 2013. Its aim was to facilitate electronic communication with the administration and to enable federal,&#xa0;State&#xa0;and local authorities to provide simpler, more user-friendly and efficient eGovernment services. The main provisions&#xa0;include:&#xa0;</p><ul><li>Obligation for federal, State and local authorities to open a point of access for the transfer of electronic&#xa0;documents;&#xa0;</li><li>Obligation for federal authorities to open a De-Mail access and to offer an electronic proof of identity via electronic identity (eID) card and electronic residence&#xa0;permit;&#xa0;</li><li>Electronic record&#xa0;keeping;&#xa0;</li><li>Enabling electronic evidence and electronic payment in administrative&#xa0;procedures;&#xa0;</li><li>Obligation to document and analyse processes before implementing IT&#xa0;systems;&#xa0;</li><li>Provision of machine-readable data (open data); and&#xa0;</li><li>Georeferencing of electronic registers.&#xa0;</li></ul><p>The eGovernment Act triggered legislative activities in most of the German federal&#xa0;States. By now,&#xa0;seven&#xa0;federal&#xa0;States have already adopted their own eGovernment Act, while several others have initiated legislative procedures.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">German Basic Law (Articles 91c and 91d)&#xa0;</p><p>On 1 August 2009, within the framework of the second round of reforms of Germany&apos;s federal structure, important changes in the&#xa0;<a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_91c.html" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">German Basic Law&#xa0;</a><span resource="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_91c.html" property="eli:title" content="German Basic Law&#xa0;"/>(<em>Grundgesetz</em>) came into force with articles 91c and 91d. Article 91c ensured the simplification of IT bodies and decision-making processes, thus increasing their effectiveness and enabling their adaptation to the needs of the fast-evolving technical progress.&#xa0;The German federation now has the exclusive legislative competence for the development of a secure linking-up network to interconnect the IT networks of national and federal States, which can prevent any underlying media issues. Furthermore, Article 91d constituted a vital component for administrative modernisation as it provides the legal basis for facilitating the federation and the federal States to directly and effectively benchmark their administrations in order to increase their effectiveness and&#xa0;transparency and&#xa0;provide better public services.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on the Connection of Information Technology Networks of Federal and State Governments&#xa0;</p><p>The envisaged objectives of the German Basic Law are implemented through&#xa0;the connection of IT networks of federal and State governments (IT-NetzG),&#xa0;adopted on 10 August 2009, as well as through an Inter-federal State Agreement, which came into force on 1 April 2010. According to this agreement, the IT Planning Council was established and tasked with developing the technical requirements for the use of the core network infrastructure. Moreover, the IT Planning Council bears the responsibility to steer cross-disciplined eGovernment projects involving both the federation and the federal States. Finally, the Council adopts decisions on IT interoperability and security standards.&#xa0;</p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Single Digital Gateway Regulation&#xa0;</p><p>On 11 December 2018, the&#xa0;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32018R1724" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">SDG Regulation 2018/1724&#xa0;</a><span resource="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32018R1724" property="eli:title" content="SDG Regulation 2018/1724&#xa0;"/>entered into force. Based on a decision of the IT Planning Council, a national stakeholder network for the SDG implementation was set up in April 2019. It consisted of SDG multipliers appointed by each of the 16 federal&#xa0;States, the national coordinator appointed by the federal government, contact persons of the&#xa0;federal&#xa0;ministries and representatives of the leading municipal associations. The network will meet at least twice a year.</p><p>Implementing the requirements for the SDG in Germany is part of the implementation of the Online Access Act (<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG) and takes place within the implementation structures of that Act. The following challenges have already been resolved:</p><ul><li>Linking the Your Europe platform with the Federal Portal, including connecting the EU search engine;</li><li>Linking the Federal Portal with the seven assistance services and, accordingly, with the EU search engine;</li><li>Providing German and English descriptions of federal and State-level services for online and offline procedures; </li><li>Adhering to the Commission&#x2019;s branding requirements such as the inclusion of the Your Europe logo; and</li><li>Gathering user feedback and collecting user statistics through our national IT components.</li></ul><p>In accordance with Article 14 of the SDG Regulation, the Commission is to provide a technical system for the cross-border application of the Once-Only principle by December 2023. The interconnection of national registers throughout the EU enables the digital exchange among EU Member States of the necessary evidence for the procedures that are to be offered entirely online. </p><p>The German registers, which hold digital evidence for the procedures in question, are to be linked to the Commission&#x2019;s technical system. The European Commission is currently conducting an evidence survey to determine what evidence is needed for which procedures in Member States. Germany is also conducting such a survey at national level.</p><p>The Commission has not yet adopted the implementing regulation on technical and operational specifications, although the deadline of 12 June 2021 has passed. From Germany&#x2019;s perspective, connecting the decentralised register landscape of our federal system to a central Commission system is the core challenge.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on&#xa0;the Reuse of Public Sector Information&#xa0;</p><p>The Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information (Directive (EU) 2019/1024) entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive (Directive 2003/98/EC), which was amended&#xa0;by Directive 2013/37/EU. Member States must transpose Directive (EU) 2019/1024 by 16 July 2021. Once fully transposed at national level, it will promote all public sector content that is in principle freely available for re-use, except in very limited cases. It will stimulate the transparency, non-discrimination and non-exclusivity of data. Furthermore, real-time data available via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), open access to publicly funded research data and high value datasets will stimulate innovation and benefit both society and the economy.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Freedom of&#xa0;Information&#xa0;Act&#xa0;</p><p>After being narrowly approved by the Bundestag in early June 2005, Germany&#x2019;s&#xa0;<a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ifg/BJNR272200005.html" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Freedom of Information (FOI) Act&#xa0;</a><span resource="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ifg/BJNR272200005.html" property="eli:title" content="Freedom of Information (FOI) Act&#xa0;"/>was voted on 8 July 2005 by the Bundesrat, published in the Federal Gazette on 13 September 2005 and came into force on 1 January 2006. The law provided the public with a general right to access&#xa0;federal government information. However, this general right was limited by several broadly defined exemptions, covering, for instance, security-sensitive issues, potential threats to public safety and even the &#x201c;fiscal interests of the federal government&#x201d;. The legislation also contained an &#x2018;internet clause&#x2019; to compel federal administration bodies to make a few items publicly available online. Certain federal States also have their own Freedom of Information Legislation.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Data Act (Article 12a)&#xa0;</p><p>The principle of open data is becoming increasingly important worldwide and the availability of data is becoming an important economic factor.&#xa0;</p><p>Considering this, on 13 July 2017 the legislator initiated an initial amendment to the eGovernment Act (EGovG) and the newly created section 12a of the EGovG (first open data Act). This created for the first time a separate legal framework for open administrative data by establishing common criteria for open data. These include free provision, free access to data and machine readability. At the same time, data protection applies and it must be ensured that such personal data are only provided for publication if the requirements regarding the protection of personal data are met.</p><p>With the second Open Data Act, which entered into force on 23 July 2021 (Act amending the eGovernment Act and introducing a law on the use of public sector data), the legislator refined the existing obligations for the federal administration in various areas under Section 12a of the EGovG and significantly extended the range of authorities obliged to do so. Other key elements are the establishment of open data coordinators in the federal authorities and the inclusion of research data in the obligation to provide them. </p><p>The nation-wide metadata portal&#xa0;GovData&#xa0;was created to ensure that the open data provided by the different administrations can be easily found.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Draft Legislation Introducing a Card for EU Citizens and Members of the&#xa0;European Economic Area </p><p>The&#xa0;draft legislation introducing a card for EU citizens and members of the European Economic Area&#xa0;(<em>Gesetz zur Einf&#xfc;hrung einer Karte f&#xfc;r Unionsb&#xfc;rger und Angeh&#xf6;rige des Europ&#xe4;ischen Wirtschaftsraums mit Funktion zum elektronischen Identit&#xe4;tsnachweis sowie zur &#xc4;nderung des Personalausweisgesetzes und weiterer Vorschriften</em>) was&#xa0;prepared&#xa0;in 2018 and was&#xa0;adopted&#xa0;by&#xa0;the&#xa0;German&#xa0;parliament&#xa0;in June 2019.&#xa0;It introduced the electronic ID card for a larger circle of people. The card is not mandatory and is available upon request for citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area.

This feature enables citizens, government agencies and businesses to reliably identify themselves on the internet. However, the use of the&#xa0;eID&#xa0;function&#xa0;lagged behind&#xa0;the expectations. In order to address this situation, since 15 July 2017, each new identity card is issued with a ready-to-use electronic identification function. With the Electronic Identification Promotion Act, several other additional measures were taken in order to promote the usage of the national&#xa0;eID&#xa0;function.

Contrary to conventional e-mails, De-Mails provide proof of delivery. It is not possible to read or manipulate the contents of a De-Mail on its journey across the internet. De-Mail providers are interoperable and provide the same level of security based on an accreditation process that is specified by the legislator. De-Mail providers&#xa0;have to&#xa0;fulfil high requirements concerning security, functions, interoperability and data protection. Furthermore, the De-Mail legislation foresees that providers must not only furnish the stated certificates for security, functionality and interoperability, but must also demonstrate comprehensive measures to protect personal data within the scope of the accreditation procedure.&#xa0;</p><p>The basic specifications for security, functionality and interoperability were drawn up by the federal government together with future De-Mail providers and laid down in technical guidelines. To ensure compliance with these guidelines, De-Mail providers are screened in an accreditation process.&#xa0;De-Mail focuses&#xa0;on data protection&#xa0;and requires, for instance, that De-Mail providers can enable the&#xa0;use&#xa0;of e-mail&#xa0;pseudonyms to prevent communications&#xa0;or consumer profiles traceability. Furthermore, when requested De-Mail providers must store the&#xa0;user&#x2019;s&#xa0;encryption certificates in the directory to support (additional) end-to-end encryption of De-Mails.&#xa0;</p><p>The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has published the approval criteria on its&#xa0;website.&#xa0;</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed ledger technologies </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big data </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud computing </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT) </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance computing </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed broadband connectivity </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Revised Telecommunications Act</p><p>The revised Telecommunications Act (TKG) entered into force in December 2021.

Compared to conventional e-mails, the delivery of De-Mails and the identity of senders and recipients can be proven. It is not possible to read or manipulate the contents of a De-Mail on its journey across the internet. One important aim is to make De-Mail confidential, reliable and binding through basic security functions that are easy to use and do not require additional installations for the end-user. The sender and recipient of a De-Mail can be clearly identified. Send and delivery certificates can be easily generated.</p><p>De-Mails are encrypted during transport and can neither be intercepted nor manipulated. Spam and phishing are effectively prevented because the De-Mail sender can be clearly identified by secure initial identification and users are able to log on with two-factor authentication using the new German&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card or a mobile phone-based method (mobile TAN). </p><p>Furthermore, De-Mail offers huge potential to optimise electronic communications in the private and public sector. Recently, business and administration processes were marked by media inconsistencies that produced considerable delays and additional costs. With the additional security functions that De-Mail provides, a large part of today&#x2019;s paper-based business and administration processes can now be handled fully electronically, simply, quickly and from any location. </p><p>The legal requirements&#xa0;for registration as De-Mail provider&#xa0;are contained in the&#xa0;Act&#xa0;on&#xa0;De-Mail services and amendments to other legislation, which entered into force on 3 May 2011.

In addition to the&#xa0;eVergabe&#xa0;platform, all public tenders from this platform are automatically and continuously published online on&#xa0;<a href="http://www.service.bund.de" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="www.service.bund.de" resource="http://www.service.bund.de">www.service.bund.de</a> (sector &#x201c;Ausschreibungen&#x201d;).&#xa0;</p><p>Presumably starting in harvest 2022 a new information service (&#x201c;Bekanntmachungsservice&#x201d;, BKMS) will be added to the &#x201c;e-Vergabe platform&#x201d; that makes it much easier for companies (as possible tenderers) to find relevant public invitations to tender published by awarding authorities from all three governmental levels (federal, states and local government level). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal eGovernment Shop&#xa0;</p><p>The <a href="http://www.kdb.bund.de/KdB/DE/Startseite/home_node.html" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="federal eprocurement platform" resource="http://www.kdb.bund.de/KdB/DE/Startseite/home_node.html">Federal eProcurement Platform</a>, the Procurement Agency of the Federal Ministry of the Interior also developed the Federal&#xa0;eGovernment shop (<em>Kaufhaus des&#xa0;Bundes</em>,&#xa0;KdB). With this solution, ordering materials takes place through an electronic catalogue. Supplies of printing paper, for instance, are ordered with a few clicks. Even customised PCs and cars can be ordered online directly from the company. Conservative calculations estimate that each electronically executed order via&#xa0;KdB&#xa0;saves at least 377 minutes (which equals EUR 195 of personnel expenses) compared to the simplest form of single tender action. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eRechnung&#xa0;</p><p>The&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;service of the federal government was completed on 27 November 2019. Federal government bodies now receive and process electronic invoices via&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;platforms (<em>Zentrale&#xa0;Rechnungseingangsplattform&#xa0;des&#xa0;Bundes, ZRE and&#xa0;Onlinezugangsgesetzkonforme&#xa0;Rechnungseingangsplattform, OZG-RE</em>). Since 27 November 2020, suppliers of federal government authorities and agencies have to submit electronic invoices for public contracts. The regulations of the German federal States may show some differences. </p><h2>ePayment </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ePayBL&#xa0;</p><p>ePayBL&#xa0;(<em>ePayment&#xa0;des&#xa0;Bundes&#xa0;und der L&#xe4;nder</em>) was established as a mandatory basic IT component&#xa0;at the federal government level.&#xa0;ePayBL&#xa0;is a software component developed by a joint community of federal (<em>bund</em>) and State (<em>l&#xe4;nder</em>) administration. It supports several payment options.&#xa0;</p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Library Portal (Bibliotheksportal)&#xa0;</p><p>The&#xa0;Library Portal&#xa0;(<em>Bibliotheksportal</em>)&#xa0;provides&#xa0;quick and easy access to a wide range of information&#xa0;through the federal intranet.

Users can, anytime and from anywhere, search&#xa0;the library catalogues of all participating libraries and the portal for specialised databases, such as&#xa0;Beck-Online, Juris, Genios and the&#xa0;Munzinger&#xa0;Archive.&#xa0;In addition, the portal contains a comprehensive&#xa0;list of links to relevant internet resources.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">XRepository&#xa0;</p><p>XRepository&#xa0;is an online library for&#xa0;XML-based data exchange formats, launched in January 2009. This website constitutes a central location for the publication of a broad spectrum of data related to eGovernment projects, including data models, XML schemes and relevant documentation. Once published, the data is available for re-use by other administrations and designers of business processes.&#xa0;The website also facilitates online research on standards and interfaces, which can be subsequently downloaded at no cost. The online library is operated by the Co-ordination Office for IT Standards (KoSIT) in Bremen.&#xa0;</p><h2>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">EBR, ECRIS and EUCARIS&#xa0;</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p>Services Registry - German Administration Services Directory</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Registry Factory&#xa0;</p><p>The Registry Factory is a solution for the construction and operation of IT systems for conducting electronic registrations in the Federal Office of Administration.
