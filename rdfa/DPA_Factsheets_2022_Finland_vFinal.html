The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategy for Public Governance Renewal</p><p>In the framework of the Strategy for Public Governance and Services of Prime Minister Sanna Marin&#x2019;s Government Programme, the Finnish government released in December 2020 its <a href="https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/162573">Strategy for Public Governance Renewal</a>. This strategy will guide and enhance the renewal of public governance as a whole from 2020 to 2030. In particular, it seeks to strengthen good governance across the country and in both national languages and, more specifically, to improve digital accessibility and encourage wider use of plain language in administration. A consistent and determined renewal of governance as described in the strategy will streamline everyday services, ensure legal certainty in society, and create new opportunities for businesses and communities. </p><p>The direction and means of administrative reform were defined together with various administrative sectors, municipalities, civil society, researchers and numerous stakeholders to agree on the goals and future policies around public governance in the 2020s. The participatory process of preparing the strategy has therefore played an important role in strengthening cooperation between the State, municipalities and future welfare regions, and the interaction between governance and the rest of society, as well as in building a common understanding of the need and direction of public governance development.</p><p>The implementation actions of the Strategy for Public Governance Renewal in 2021&#x2013;22 include networking projects, events and development work that foster the achievement of the goals set in the strategy and inspire dialogue between different actors, increasing the knowledge base through studies and analysis, and competence renewal through education and training. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Climate and Environment Strategy for the ICT Sector</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Programme of Prime Minister Marin </p><p>On 2 September 2021, the government appointed a Ministerial Working Group on Advancing the Digital Transformation, the Data Economy and the Public Administration. More specifically, the group is responsible for guiding and directing the development of the public administration, the digital transformation, the data economy and the information policy at the government level, and coordinating the relating activities and situational awareness.

These three themes were translated into the following commitments for the implementation phase:</p><ul><li>Sustainable openness by pervading all government actions and development measures;</li><li>Implementation of the Open Government Strategy, which will determine the long-term direction and the objectives to be used as the basis for building future action plans;</li><li>Creation of a Transparency Register that will offer citizens information on the parties that seek to influence decision-making;</li><li>Commitment and measures on open data; and</li><li>Enhancement of the use and skills of dialogue in the public sector.</li></ul><p>The realisation of these commitments will be <a href="http://www.avoinhallinto.fi">monitored and evaluated</a> during the implementation of the plan and after its finalisation.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">2018 Government Report to Parliament on Information Policy and Artificial Intelligence </p><p>In December 2018, the government submitted a <a href="https://vm.fi/en/information-policy-report">report</a> to Parliament on Information Policy and Artificial Intelligence, which highlighted several policy issues, with a particular focus on the ethics of information policy and artificial intelligence. This report marked the beginning of a new and more cohesive policy response to Digital Public Administration. </p><p>The Parliament approved the report in March 2019 with four statements. In this context, the Parliament obliged the government to continue its work on the ethics of information policy and artificial intelligence, and to formulate them in more concrete terms.

The government will carry out a reform of personal identity codes, which in their current form were introduced in the 1960s and contain the holder&#x2019;s date of birth and gender. As part of the reform, gender will no longer be specified in the personal identity code.

This project aims to implement a new mobile phone-based digital identity solution, which will be issued by the Finnish Police. The digital identity will be implemented following the principles of self-sovereign identity (SSI), i.e. arranging the sharing of data in a human-centric way. The citizen should be able use the digital identity to prove his or her identity both in physical and in electronic authentication scenarios.

The strategic development focuses on strategic management and the promotion of procurement skills, with information management and impact assessment supporting strategic management. At the heart of the development work is the acquisition of functional and high-quality products and services so that all parties are involved in the process, the market is vibrant and innovation can be generated as part of public procurement. Through the development of these elements, public procurement can achieve economic, social and ecological sustainability. </p><p>As of spring 2022, the strategy was progressing according to plan. Nearly 30 measures, including measures to promote green and low-carbon procurement, information management and digitisation, innovative public procurement, employment through procurement, procurement expertise and the role of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and human rights in procurement processes, had been completed or were in progress. </p><p>Overall, around 500 public and municipal procurement professionals, representatives of tender companies, researchers and representatives of various expert organisations are actively participating in the eight thematic groups focused around the eight strategic common goals.

One of the recent implementation actions of the report is a new national address database project. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Programme of Prime Minister Marin</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Artificial Intelligence 4.0 Programme (2020&#x2013;2023)</p><ol><li>SMEs&#x2019; digital capabilities and innovation cooperation;</li><li>Effective EU cooperation;</li><li>Technological leadership; and</li><li>Digital green transition.</li></ol><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Artificial Intelligence Programme AuroraAI</p><p>The <a href="https://vm.fi/en/national-artificial-intelligence-programme-auroraai">AuroraAI Programme</a> (2020&#x2013;2022) is one of the public sector digitisation programmes of the government of Prime Minister Sanna Marin. It was one of the key recommendations of the <a href="https://www.tekoalyaika.fi/en/">Finnish Artificial Intelligence Programme</a> on building the world&#x2019;s best public services by using AI solutions and was launched by the Ministry of Finance on 6 February 2020 to continue the development carried out by the preliminary study of 2018&#x2013;2019. </p><p>The programme lays the technical and operational foundations for building a human&#x2011;centric administration by using AI to bring services and people together in a better way in different events and situations of life. The technical infrastructure, called AuroraAI network, aims to create the technical conditions enabling smooth interaction and communication, and interoperability between different services and platforms, as the Artificial Intelligence Programme&#x2019;s report of 2017 suggested. In addition to the AuroraAI network, the programme is developing an operating model to arrange public services in a way that they can support people in their life events and organisations in their business activities, in collaboration with service providers in other sectors. The model will provide public organisations with tools and examples to develop their operations in a way that enhances human-centricity and the use of the AuroraAI infrastructure. </p><p>The aim of the programme is to deploy the first version of the AuroraAI network and the operating model by the end of 2022. The programme is implemented together with stakeholders from State agencies, municipalities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and academia.&#xa0; </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big data</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud computing </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT) </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance computing</h3><p>Involvement in High-performance Computing</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Infrastructure Strategy 2025</p><p>Letter of Intent on the Development of 5G in the Nordic Region</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-617.jpeg" alt="35-617.jpeg" class="keepElement"/></p><p>	 Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><p>4</p><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/legalframework/Finland" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2>Specific legislation on digital public administration</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act on Information Management in Public Administration </p><p>The <a href="https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190906" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Act on Information Management in Public Administration </a><span resource="https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190906" property="eli:title" content="Act on Information Management in Public Administration "/>(906/2019)entered into force on 1 January 2020.
