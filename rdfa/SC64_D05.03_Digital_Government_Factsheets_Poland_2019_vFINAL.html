The objective was to modernise public administration with the use of digital technologies corresponding to the need to improve the efficiency of the state and improve the quality of administration relations with citizens and other stakeholders.

The guidelines concerned the Application Programming Interface (API) Standard; Security Standard; Technical Standard; and Legal Standard. In 2018, the Polish Ministry of Digital Affaires elaborated to ensure a higher quality of data was provided by the public administration. Open data may now be reused for research or business purposes. Opening public data makes the activities of public administration more transparent and allows civic control over these activities. Personal data protection and legal or technical considerations should not prevent data opening. Public open data standards for the administration were developed as part of the project: &quot;Open data &#x2013; access, standard, education.&#x201D; This motto highlighted the need for proper preparation and sharing of data for the reuse. It included guidelines on legal regulation, ensuring data security and privacy protection, technical aspects of data sharing and access to databases through APIs (Application Programming Interface).</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;"><a id="_Toc1474954"/>eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;"><a id="_Toc1474955"/>Security aspects related to digital government</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strengthening of cybersecurity </p><ul><li>The adoption of the Act of 5 July 2018 on the national cyber security system. <a href="https://www.gov.pl/cyfryzacja/strategia-cyberbezpieczenstwa-przyjeta-przez-rzad">The National Framework of Cybersecurity Policy of The Republic of Poland for 2017-2022</a>.

The purpose of this project was to allow Polish citizens, companies and other entities to identify themselves online in order to access the public administration&#x2019;s electronic services. This target will be achieved through the integration of different, currently functioning eID systems to create a single, standardised access point to eID services. Moreover, the Polish eIDAS Node will be linked to the national eID nodes of the other EU Member States.</p><p>Since March 2017, a few new eServices concerning eID have been introduced in Poland, as listed below:</p><ul><li>The Ministry of Digital Affairs launched <a href="https://obywatel.gov.pl/dokumenty-i-dane-osobowe/mdokumenty-potwierdzaj-tozsamosc-smartfonem">mDocuments</a> - a pilot version of a service enabling citizens to confirm their identity (or rights, e.g.: for driving a car) through a mobile device (mobile phone or smartphone), instead of paper documents;</li><li>The so-called Trusted Profile, an eIdentification method ensured by the public administration, was integrated with the seven biggest banks operating in Poland;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/cyfryzacja/nowa-koncepcja-wdrozenia-polskiego-dowodu-osobistego-z-warstwa-elektroniczna">e-ID project</a> (former <a href="http://plid.obywatel.gov.pl/about">pl.ID project</a>) was initiated. Its main purpose was to replace traditional plastic ID cards with new e-cards. eID cards became available in March 2019. The implemented eID card included an integrated electronic layer which contained the same data as those available at the graphic layer. The electronic layer included 3 certificates: presence confirmation (only tap needed), identification and authorisation (4 number PIN needed) and personal signature authorisation (6 number PIN needed). Furthermore, an additional space for qualified certificate of personal signature was provided. Implementation of this last certificate was voluntary.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification</p><p><a href="http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU20160001579" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">The Act</a><span resource="http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU20160001579" property="eli:title" content="The Act"/> was adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014, on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">the eIDAS Regulation</a><span resource="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG" property="eli:title" content="the eIDAS Regulation"/>).

The Act on the NCSS was not only a simple transposition of the NIS Directive. The Act combined eight supplementary secondary legislation regulations, inter alia: an ordinance of the Council of Ministers on thresholds for considering an incident as significant, an ordinance of the Council of Ministers on the list of essential services and thresholds of significance of the disruptive effect of an incident on the provision of essential services, an ordinance of the Minister of Digital Affairs regarding organisational and technical conditions for entities providing services in the field of cyber security as well as technical conditions for internal structures responsible for cybersecurity within essential service providers, and set out a comprehensive National Cyber Security System. The Government decided to maintain and develop its decentralised approach towards a governance structure of its cybersecurity system. There was a clear division of responsibilities and capabilities between all engaged institutions established pursuant to the Act. The Act allowed the creation of an efficient, comprehensive system that allowed stakeholders to detect, prevent, and mitigate the impact of incidents that affected Polish national interests, while helping crucial societal and economic activities. </p><p>The Act created a coherent incident response system based on the leading role of three Computer Security Incident Response Teams at the national level (CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK and CSIRT GOV) with a certain and clear division of constituencies. </p><p>The Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity, responsible for coordination of activities and implementation of the government policy in the field of providing cyber security, as well as the Advisory Committee operating at the Council of Ministers, in the capacity of a consultative and advisory body in matters of cyber security and relevant activities of CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK, CSIRT GOV, sectoral cyber security teams and the competent authorities for cyber security, were set up.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Cybersecurity Framework Act</p><p>This entity works on new national legislation in the field of cybersecurity.

However, it was necessary to continue activities in the scope of full harmonisation of the national legal order in connection with the effective date of the GDPR. The law enforcement package of the GDPR enforced amendments to over 162 Polish acts, ensuring national laws complied with the GDPR. On 21 February 2019, Parliament adopted a package, <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20180001000" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">an act amending certain acts</a><span resource="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20180001000" property="eli:title" content="an act amending certain acts"/> in connection with ensuring the application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament, and of the Council of 27 April 2016, on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and the repeal of Directive 95/46/EC.

It enabled the development of eProcurement systems for Polish public administrations, the use of advanced electronic signatures in the submission of tenders, and the use of electronic auctions for certain contracts. In April 2006, the Public Procurement Law was largely amended in order to implement the provisions of the EU Directives on public procurement (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0017:EN:HTML">2004/17/EC</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0018:EN:HTML">2004/18/EC</a>), including those pertaining to electronic auctions and the Dynamic Purchasing System. This amended version placed electronic communications between the awarding entity and the economic operator on the same level as that of written or fax communications, regardless of the procurement procedure in question.

The objective is to create a common data format, which will make it possible to compare and analyse data so that public institutions are able to draw practical conclusions and make strategic decisions. Bringing together BigData analytics and market intelligence, the platform will provide tools enabling forecasting, developing strategy models and finally making decisions based on credible data. </p><p>The first concept of the project was drafted in November 2017 and developed throughout 2018. In the process, six major social issues were identified as priorities to be solved by the Polish government. The platform will provide solutions enabling data analysis, which will enable the responsible institutions to undertake the appropriate action to solve their problems.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474997"/>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eIDAS Node</p><p>So far, Polish citizens can set up a Trusted Profile and use it only in national e-services. Foreign nationals cannot use his/her national eID in Polish e-services. </p><p>The Polish eIDAS Node allows citizens to extend their use of a Trusted Profile for electronic services of other countries. In the same way, citizens of EU countries will be able to use their national eID systems to login to Polish electronic services (such as ePUAP, PUE ZUS, biznes.gov.pl etc.).</p><p>The Polish eIDAS Node is a gateway for the <a href="https://login.gov.pl/login/main">National Electronic Identification Node</a>. As each EU Member State implements its own electronic services and eID systems in various ways, depending on its legal and organisational aspects, eIDAS Nodes provides mechanisms for integrating the Polish National Node with relevant systems of other EU countries.</p><p>To ensure an adequate level of security, it is planned that only notified eID systems of the EU Member States will be admitted to the cross-border login system. However, allowing access to national e-services for non-notified eID systems needs bilateral agreements between countries. </p><p>The eIDAS solution allows citizens from Member States to prove and verify their identification when accessing on-line services in other Member States. It allows citizens to authenticate themselves by using their eIDs and connecting with their Identity Provider (IdP) from their country. The high-level process is as follows:</p><ol><li>The citizen requests an on-line service in a Member State.</li><li>The citizen is requested to authenticate themselves by the on-line service.</li><li>At the authentication stage, it becomes apparent that the citizen has an eID from another Member State.</li><li>The request is sent to the citizen&#x2019;s country for authentication, through the eIDAS solution, to the citizen&#x2019;s Identity Provider (IdP) where authentication takes place.</li><li>The authentication result is returned to the service provider.</li><li>Authentication is complete, and the citizen can proceed with accessing the service.</li></ol><p>The eIDAS Solution makes different eID national protocols interoperable with each other. The solution uses the eIDAS protocol to translate national identification data into a common format that is understood and used by Member States.</p><p>This allows the eIDs of Member States to be interoperable and accepted in other Member States, opening new possibilities and opportunities for citizens to use services across-border.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Single Point of Contact</p><p>The Single Point of Contact is a communication interface (node) between the Schengen Member States or Associated States. It allows for effective on-line communication, leading to regular implementation of tasks related to the exchange of cryptographic keys. In general, it will be used to exchange certificates between all countries of the Schengen area, which will enable the services (most often the Border Guard) to verify travel documents (usually passports) on this basis. Suspicious persons (or suspects) will be subject to further verification of fingerprints with imprints placed in the document.</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">System of State Registers (SSR)</p><p>The system combines five registers: PESEL, Personal Data Register, Registry of Civil Status, System of State Awards, Central Register of Objections.
