The goal of the strategy is to prevent digital exclusion and provide what the population needs to be able to use the digital tools and services society depends upon today. Everyone should be able to participate in society, in democratic processes and in social communities by using digital tools.</p><p>The strategy focuses on several challenges such as digital vulnerability, the digital divide and exclusion. The government aims are:</p><ul><li>To help prevent digital exclusion in all age groups;</li><li>To facilitate free, quality-assured assistance services for citizens with little or no digital competence;</li><li>To further develop the partnership with KS (Norwegian Association of Local and Regional Authorities) to facilitate the development of good, local guidance services throughout the country;</li><li>To hold the business sector more accountable for including all citizens in the digital services they provide;</li><li>To help ensure that, as a rule, publicly funded low-threshold services aimed at people with little or no digital competence are free;</li><li>To ensure regular mapping of citizens&#x2019; level of digital competence;</li><li>To work together with public, private and voluntary providers on a campaign to encourage citizens who need to improve their digital competence to register for courses; and</li><li>To consider whether one public agency should be assigned overarching responsibility for coordinating national efforts to improve the population&#x2019;s digital competence.</li></ul><p>The strategy has some focus areas:</p><ul><li>Internet access (the digital foundation);</li><li>Available ICT equipment;</li><li>Basic digital skills;</li><li>User friendly digital services;</li><li>Digital judgement (ability to reflect and think critically); and</li><li>Other measures (guidance, user input).</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">White Paper on An Innovative Public Sector (Report.

To achieve this goal, the government has developed three principles to foster public sector innovation:</p><ul><li>Politicians and public authorities need to ensure freedom of action and provide incentives for innovation;</li><li>Leaders must develop a culture of innovation and the ensuing competence, where people have the courage to think differently and learn from mistakes and successes; and</li><li>Public agencies must seek new forms of collaboration.</li></ul><p>With increased attention to the development of cross-cutting services, an innovation culture, digital leadership skills and new models for collaboration across sectors and levels of government, the paper aims to contribute in the long run to developing new business models in the public sector.</p><p>The newly adopted strategy has five key priorities:</p><ul><li>A user centric focus;</li><li>ICT should constitute a significant input factor for innovation and productivity;</li><li>Strengthened digital competence and inclusion;</li><li>An effective digitisation of the public sector; and</li><li>Sound data protection and information security.</li></ul><p>Advanced use of ICT in business and public sectors depends on a good infrastructure (broadband) and a sufficient knowledge of ICT within the population. It is important that technological solutions are accessible to everyone, including the visually and hearing impaired. In addition, to achieve the objectives of ICT policy, the research and development of ICT and advanced ICT skills needs to be strengthened.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">One Digital Public Sector: Digital Strategy for the Public Sector 2019&#x2013;2025</p><ul><li>Achieve the digitalisation of the public sector in a transparent, inclusive and trustworthy way;</li><li>Perform more tasks digitally as well as the delivery of services;</li><li>Encourage citizens, businesses and voluntary organisations to communicate digitally with the public sector;</li><li>Exploit the sharing and using of data to create user-friendly services and to promote value creation for businesses; </li><li>Help local and central government agencies to develop their services based on a common digital ecosystem for cooperation; and</li><li>Help local and central government agencies to gain from digitalisation in a systematic manner.</li></ul><p>The Action Plan accompanying this strategy is coordinated by the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital21</p><p><a href="https://digital21.no/">Digital21</a> was initiated by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry as a result of recommendations in the industrial report, <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meld.-st.-27-20162017/id2546209/">Meld.

The purpose is to create a strategy across industries and fields of expertise, where key actors support common goals and recommended measures.</p><p>The long-term goal of Digital21 is to support and accelerate digitalisation for businesses. To do so, Digital21 has identified six areas of significant importance:</p><ul><li>Emerging technologies;</li><li>Research, development and innovation;</li><li>Competence;</li><li>Computer resources and infrastructure;</li><li>Safety; and</li><li>Public framework.</li></ul><p>Digital21 has established expert groups in each of these six areas.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Interoperability Framework</p><p>The <a href="https://www.digdir.no/samhandling/rammeverk-digital-samhandling/2148">Digital Interoperability Framework</a> was first published in April 2018. It aims to help public enterprises define, develop and manage digital services, including cross-sector services, and to facilitate the exchange of data and services between public services.</p><p>The framework is based on the European Interoperability Framework, and covers organisational, judicial, semantic and technical aspects of interoperability. </p><p>The interoperability framework is also related to the <a href="https://www.digdir.no/digitalisering-og-samordning/overordnede-arkitekturprinsipper/1065">Norwegian architecture principles</a>. The principles were revised in 2019 and a new version was published in January 2020. Increased interoperability is one of the main considerations of the new version. The principles are mandatory for State-level public entities, while local and regional level public entities are strongly recommended to use the principles as well.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">White Paper on &#x2018;Data as a Resource&#x2019; (Report St. 22 (2020&#x2013;2021))</p><p>In March 2021, the Norwegian government presented the White Paper on <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/4f357e18bd314dc08c8e1b447b71b700/no/pdfs/stm202020210022000dddpdfs.pdf">Data as a Resource &#x2013; Data-driven Economy and Innovation</a>. This white paper includes national principles for sharing and using data.</p><p>&#xa0;</p><p>The government&apos;s ambition is to increase data sharing within the business community and between the public and private sectors. Although data make up an ever-larger share of value creation in most Norwegian industries and sectors today, the business community must become even better at utilising its own data and to share data within established value chains. Increased digitalisation and better data utilization will be important if Norwegian businesses are to remain competitive nationally and internationally. </p><p>&#xa0;</p><p>Public data is of value for businesses in that they can be used in new contexts, interconnected with different data and contribute to innovation, new services and products. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">New Strategy for eID</p><p>The Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development has decided to put in place a<a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/alle-skal-ha-tilgang-til-sikker-elektronisk-id/id2832399/"> new Strategy for Electronic Identification (eID</a>), due to be published later in 2022.</p><p>The main goals for eID and trust services are laid out in the <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/one-digital-public-sector/id2653874/">One Digital Public Sector</a> strategy. It states that all citizens should have an eID that can be used for the services they need. All groups, including foreign nationals without a Norwegian national identity number, and children and adolescents, should be able to obtain an eID at the level they need. Individuals who are unable to act digitally themselves, must have the opportunity to be represented by a proxy. Provisions must therefore be made for the use of digital authorisations and digital consent.

It is the fourth of its kind in the country and is intended to address issues such as the need to reinforce public-private, civilian-military and international cooperation. The primary target groups are authorities and companies in both public and private sectors, including municipalities. Moreover, the strategy lays the foundations for ensuring private individuals the necessary knowledge and understanding of risks in order to use technology in a safe and secure way.</p><p>The main goals are organised in five priority areas (preventive cybersecurity; cybersecurity in critical societal functions; competence; detect and handle cyberattacks; prevent and combat cybercrime) and sets a two-part <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/contentassets/c57a0733652f47688294934ffd93fc53/list-of-measures--national-cyber-security-strategy-for-norway.pdf">list of measures</a>: part one describes key measures that support the strategy and part two lists ten basic measures that both public and private companies are recommended to implement. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Once-Only Principle</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Programme for Digital Procurement</p><p>It aims to provide great benefits for the business sector in the form of simpler processes, less handling of paper documents and increased reuse.</p><p>An all-digital procurement process streamlines and facilitates an important and resource-intensive process. Participation in public procurement competitions takes less time and becomes more attractive to businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>For public clients, the full digitalisation of the procurement process leads to resource savings and increased quality as well as greater transparency.
