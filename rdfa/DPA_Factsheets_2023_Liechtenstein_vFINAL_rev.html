The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Liechtenstein in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p>	</p><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Liechtenstein&#x2019;s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall fair performance in the implementation of the EIF Principles, despite the lack of data for Principles 2 (Inclusion and Accessibility), 4 (Reusability), 6 (User-centricity), 9 (Multilingualism) and 10 (Administrative simplification). Liechtenstein gets a high score of 4 on the implementation of Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility), scoring above the EU average. The implementation of principle 12 has resulted in a higher score of 3 instead of 2 in 2022. However, Liechtenstein could continue to improve the implementation of Principle 12 (assessment of effectiveness and efficiency) by assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of interoperability solutions and technology options, taking into account user needs, proportionality and the balance between costs and benefits (Recommendation 19).</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Liechtenstein in Scoreboard 2 illustrate a good performance with scores 4 in all layers, despite the lack of data for the technical interoperability. Liechtenstein&#x2019;s areas of improvement concern the better implementation of the recommendations related to the interoperability governance.

However, areas for improvements concern the implementation of recommendations related to the conceptual model. More specifically, Liechtenstein public administrations could focus on designing new services or reengineer existing ones and reuse, whenever possible, existing service and data components (Recommendation 34). Furthermore, in the area of security and privacy, the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services is only partial and could be improved (Recommendation 47).</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Liechtenstein concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show a good performance of the country in 16 indicators despite the lack of data in several indicators. However, Bulgaria has still margin for improvement. For instance, efforts could focus on the consultation of relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level, in accordance with your NIF and relevant DIFs, when procuring and developing ICT solutions (i.e. Interoperability governance - Recommendation 23) and on the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services.

The new revised eGovernment Strategy includes a vision, principles and guidelines for the implementation of digital services as well as defined areas of action. The strategy will be implemented by means of individual projects.</p><p>Although the State administration relies heavily on eGovernment, citizens continue to enjoy non-electronic access to all administrative services. However, eGovernment should facilitate access to administrative services and make business transactions more efficient. The administration thus enables a customer-friendly, personal and competent service, both electronically and non-electronically.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-605.png" alt="A picture containing night sky
