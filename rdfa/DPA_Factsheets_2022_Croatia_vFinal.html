More in detail, the Act on the Right of Access to Information regulated the right of access to information and re&#x2011;use of information held by public authorities, and it laid down the principles, the restrictions and the procedure for the exercise of the right of access to information and the re-use of information, as well as the scope, the mode and the conditions for the appointment and dismissal of the Information Commissioner; it also governed the inspection of the implementation of this act, as well as the misdemeanour provisions related to the exercise of the right of access to information and other obligations of public authorities. </p><p>The act was amended in 2015 (OJ 85/15), extending the obligation to publish open data as well as providing information on reuse. According to the Act on the Right of Access to Information and in accordance with the PSI Directive, public authorities should not restrict the reuse of their data sets and the terms of use should be minimal. </p><p>Activities are ongoing to amend the Act on the Right of Access to Information according to Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council on open data and re-use of public sector information. These activities include e.g. a working group within the Ministry of Justice and Administration which will prepare a draft law on amendments to the Law on the Right of Access to Information. The aim of this law is to harmonise with Directive (EU) 2019/1024 and to eliminate in practice shortcomings in the application of the act. The final draft of the new law was presented to the Croatian Parliament in November 2021 and final adoption is expected soon.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Reuse of Public Sector Information (PSI)</p><p>The obligation to provide data for reuse and to open data is regulated by the <a href="http://www.digured.hr/cadial/searchdoc.php?action=search&amp;query=NN+85/15&amp;searchText=on&amp;searchTitle=on&amp;filteracttype=all&amp;filterfields=all&amp;filtereuchapter=all&amp;resultlimitnum=10&amp;resultdetails=basic&amp;lang=hr&amp;resultoffset=10&amp;bid=4A4CWRLPu7Mz/HV2V+0AhQ==&amp;annotate=on" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law on the Right of Access to Information</a><span resource="http://www.digured.hr/cadial/searchdoc.php?action=search&amp;query=NN+85/15&amp;searchText=on&amp;searchTitle=on&amp;filteracttype=all&amp;filterfields=all&amp;filtereuchapter=all&amp;resultlimitnum=10&amp;resultdetails=basic&amp;lang=hr&amp;resultoffset=10&amp;bid=4A4CWRLPu7Mz/HV2V+0AhQ==&amp;annotate=on" property="eli:title" content="Law on the Right of Access to Information"/> (OJ 25/13, 85/15), which transposed the PSI Directive.

At the end of 2021, 99 eServices were available to citizens on the portal. </p><p>An integral component of the eCitizen portal is NIAS (National Identification and Authentication System) that serves as a secure and reliable identification and authentication mechanism for citizens who access public electronic services through the appropriate credentials.</p><p>Another integral part of the eCitizen portal is the User Mailbox, where public institutions can send 122 kinds of personalised messages with various information and notifications, such as information about the expiration of personal documents, individual documents and the status of individual proceedings.</p><p>As of 3 May 2021, the redesigned e-Citizens Portal was released to the public. The redesign process was guided by an agile project management methodology, and the redesign itself was aimed at improving the portal user experience, as well as improving the interface clarity, simplicity and usability. All pages are equally usable regardless of the device through which the citizen accesses them (computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.).</p><p>The redesign also introduced new paradigms in thinking about the life roles of citizens (individual, parenthood, entrepreneurship, etc.) and for each role the e-Citizens system must ensure easy use of services without additional login and identification.</p><p>The redesign introduced a new central component, the Navigation Bar, as part of a single user interface in all public e-services, whether for individuals or business users. The navigation bar allows users to easily and quickly select the entity on whose behalf they want to act and use the selected e-service (business users for their businesses and parents for their children). The selection of the entity on whose behalf the user wants to act is retrieved automatically from public registers.</p><p>The new electronic services implemented in the eCitizen system during 2021 were: </p><ul><li><strong>Delivery of electronic documents for vehicle registration in the Republic of Croatia</strong>, enabling delivery of electronic documents in the vehicle registration, testing and homologation procedures.</li><li><strong>e-Renewal</strong>, enabling owners and co-owners of earthquake-damaged houses and buildings to submit requests for reconstruction or financial assistance</li><li><strong>Geoportal of the City of Jastrebarsko</strong>, enabling citizens to submit a request to change the data related to the utility fee, report a utility infrastructure problem and propose changes to local spatial plans.</li><li><strong>e-Enrolment in educational institutions</strong>, which enables submitting and monitoring the status of applications for enrolment of a child in preschool education institutions (in this phase, the service is enabled for enrolment in kindergarten).</li><li><strong>EU Digital COVID certificate</strong>, enabling citizens to obtain a digital vaccination, testing and recovery certificate during the COVID-19 epidemic..</li><li><strong>Request for issuance of a card for the maritime transport of persons with disabilities</strong>, enabling submission of applications for the issuance of the card for free transport on state ferry lines.</li><li><strong>e-Application for life partnership</strong>, enabling partners to submit an application to enter into a life partnership.</li><li><strong>Census of population, households and dwellings in the Republic of Croatia in 2021</strong>, enabling citizens self-enumeration using the census questionnaire in electronic form.</li><li><strong>My network - HEP Distribution System Operator</strong>, enabling citizens delivery of information regarding their connection to the electricity network.</li><li><strong>e-Driving schools</strong>, enabling legal entities and craftsmen to submit requests for opening a new driving school.</li><li><strong>Selection of pension</strong> (pension only from the 1<sup>st</sup> pillar or pension from the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar), which enables the selection of pensions in electronic form.</li><li><strong>Pension Insurance Company (registration/change),</strong> which enables the registration/change of pension insurance company in electronic form.</li><li><strong>Register of tax advisors</strong>, which enables natural and legal persons to submit applications for registration in the register of tax advisors.</li></ul><p>By setting up the eCitizen system, a major step was taken to modernise public services and to bring public administration closer to citizens. </p><p>Since the beginning of its operation until the end of December 2021, there were 1&#xa0;571&#xa0;744 unique users of the eCitizen system and there were as many as 80 040 135 logins to the available eServices. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">e-Business (integrated into eCitizens portal)</p><p>The <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/e-poslovanje/1584" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="e-business project" resource="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/e-poslovanje/1584">e-Business project</a> aims at contributing to administrative relief for business entities through electronic communication with public administration. Its main goal is to achieve financial and time savings for businesses, increase the availability of public services and efficiency of public administration while strengthening the capacity of officials and employees.</p><p>The components of the e-Business project, which are also integral component of the State information infrastructure are: the e-Citizen portal (Gov.hr) with public information and electronic services for businesses, the National Identification and Authentication System (NIAS) with a new subsystem of e-Authorization for a single login for business users to e-services and the Navigation Bar as part of a common user interface of e-services. The Navigation Bar enables users to choose the business entity on whose behalf they wish to act, and also contains the link to User Mailbox (KP) for secure and reliable communication with individual business entities.</p><p>The Navigation Bar that enables users to choose the business entity on whose behalf they wish to act is connected with various business registers. Users authorised to represent legal entities are automatically retrieved trough the Navigation Bar from several registers: the Court Register, the Registers of non-profit organizations (Register of Associations, Foundations, Political Parties and Religious Communities), the Trade Register for crafts, and the Register of Farmers and Family Farms.</p><p>In addition, the persons authorised to represent may, through the e-Authorization and its e-Power of Attorney form, grant the right of access to other persons within their business entity or other persons in another business entity. This functionality provides all business users with the necessary flexibility while accessing to and using the public e-services available.</p><p>As part of the project activities carried out during 2021, a test and production platform was established, on which the integration of the first e-services intended for business entities began (6 e-services are to this day available on the e-Citizens portal under the Business heading).

The project beneficiary is currently the Central State Office for the Development of the Digital Society. The projects implementation period is from 26 September 2018 to 26 October 2021.</p><p>The e-Fee system enables end users to pay the total price of the public service in a single, aggregate payment, and for it to be further automatically distributed through the State treasury system to those parties and entities to which it belongs according to applicable regulations.</p><p>The e-Fees system will increase the availability of public services, enable cashless collection of fees and charges in the provision of public services and their management. The goal is to fully improve the communication of public administration with users - individuals and legal entities - by fully computerising business processes.
