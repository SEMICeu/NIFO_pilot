It sets out how the government will act not only in its traditional role as promoter and regulator, but also as incubator and accelerator for change towards digitalisation. </p><p>Building on the initiatives undertaken across the last seven years, the government will continue its drive to use digital technologies as a key tool to enhance the way public services are delivered, moving from front-end digital platforms to end-to-end service offerings delivered seamlessly across mobile and web. It will also continue investing in emerging technologies, i.e. by setting up a digital innovation hub, providing open access to public government databases, expanding funding for RD&amp;I, and cultivating an ecosystem conducive and supportive of digitalisation. The Strategy also identifies how policy can be used to drive positive change across all segments of society. </p><p>By drawing in citizen, business and public administration experiences gathered from a wide-consultation process, the Strategy offers a vision for a digitally transformed society that enables the solutions for key needs and challenges experienced by citizens and the business community. </p><p>The Digital Strategy outlines a digital transformation journey path, with wellbeing and social welfare at its core. It aims to provide the overarching vision for future transformative measures and initiatives to complement and guide current and future initiatives in the local digital landscape.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Maltese government signed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment &#x2013; together with other EU Member States &#x2013; to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Mapping Tomorrow &#x2013; A Strategic Plan for the Digital Transformation of the Public Administration (2019-2021)</p><p><a href="https://publicservice.gov.mt/en/Documents/MappingTomorrow_StrategicPlan2019.pdf">Mapping Tomorrow</a>&#xa0;is a strategic plan for the public administration. The public administration will enter a new era of further simplification of public services to reduce the administrative burden on its clients and to provide client-centred public services through digital transformation. The document sets a clear vision with well-articulated goals and an ambitious implementation plan.</p><p>The government&#x2019;s vision aspires to take public services to the next level of improvement through the adoption of digital technologies. The vision is to have a public administration empowered by digital transformation.</p><p>This Plan does not exist in isolation but builds on previous achievements, such as the drive to provide services which are available 24/7. Based on past achievements, this Strategic Plan sets three goals which build upon each other and form a continuum of improvement in service delivery.</p><p>Goals:</p><ul><li>Take-up;</li><li>Once-Only; and</li><li>Service of excellence.</li></ul><p>The first goal links to previous strategies and aims to introduce simplified services, which are digital end-to-end, to increase take-up.</p><p>Once-Only is the core goal, aiming at internal sharing and re-use of data and information that has been previously provided by a citizen or organisation. The aim is to stop asking for information which already exists within government.</p><p>The third goal brings public services in line with social trends and demands, and to the quality levels expected by citizens and businesses. It looks at the adoption of emerging technologies, such as AI, to offer personalised, user-friendly and timely public services. The goal is to exceed client expectations.</p><p>The goals are ambitious and require a coordinated and collective approach from all ministries. Stakeholders need to embrace a number of key-enabling concepts, principles, and technologies that are designed to bring the whole of government together.</p><p>The specific concepts at the heart of this Strategic Plan are: </p><ul><li>Client-centricity;</li><li>One government;</li><li>Sharing and re-use;</li><li>End-to-end services;</li><li>Digital by default; and</li><li>Process re-engineering.</li><li>The generic principles to be adopted throughout this digital transformation are:</li><li>Trust;</li><li>Stronger awareness;</li><li>Security and privacy;</li><li>Agility and continuous improvement;</li><li>Accessibility;</li><li>Availability;</li><li>Ongoing investment and celebrating success;</li><li>Interoperability and cross-border adoption of emerging technologies in order to meet and exceed clients&#x2019; expectations;</li><li>AI;</li><li>Internet of Things;</li><li>Distributed ledger technologies;</li><li>Business intelligence and analytics; and</li><li>Immersive technologies.</li></ul><p>The implementation plan is based on four strategic pillars which bring together different elements of the public administration, so that work can be coordinated with clear authority and responsibility. </p><p><strong>Pillar 1: A Client-Centric Public Administration </strong></p><p>A number of major milestones to strengthen the relationship which has been built between the government and its clients, bringing the latter closer to the design of digital services, including also those who are not so tech-savvy.</p><p><strong>Pillar 2: Sector-Specific Programmes</strong></p><p>Services that are specific to the relevant sectors, without detracting from the notion that for clients the public administration is a whole entity. </p><p><strong>Pillar 3: Internal Solutions for the Public Administration</strong></p><p>Empowering employees and modernising internal (user and corporate) solutions are equally important. The Plan aims to provide the public administration with the right tools and corporate solutions for use across government.</p><p><strong>Pillar 4: Technological Platforms and Solutions</strong></p><p>Digital transformation requires a technological platform to enable solutions to be implemented. The current infrastructure will be upgraded with advanced technologies, giving more autonomy to ministries in a secure environment. </p><p><strong>Governance and Implementation </strong></p><p>The Plan also identifies a number of governance elements for a successful implementation. The advocacy of critical success factors calls for a re-engineering exercise to adopt a horizontal approach; it mandates careful investments in both human capital and systems and technologies; and while it sets clear governing structures, it invites further action to keep the plan current. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Centralised Digital Enabling Services Policy</p><p>The <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GMICT_P_0121_Centralised_Digital_Enabling_Services.pdf">policy</a> published in December 2019 aims to encourage the use of centralised digital enabling services within the public administration and guide the adoption of alternative services in order to ensure data security. The policy recommends that all government bodies and agencies should, unless they have specific needs, give priority to the following centralised digital enabling services provided by the government:</p><ul><li>Cloud services, especially for storing, processing, transmitting or sharing classified information;</li><li>Electronic payment service (Government Payment Gateway);</li><li>Notifications Service and</li><li>Video Streaming Service.</li></ul><h2/><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National ICT Interoperability Framework (NIF)</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Identity Management System</p><p>The <a href="https://identitymalta.com/services/">National Identity Management System (NIDMS) </a>provides the functionality necessary to consolidate eID Account data and seamlessly associate them with the eID, eRP and ePassport lifecycle.

This policy is based on the ISO27001 Information Security International Standard and is applicable to everyone within the public sector. As part of its Security Governance framework, the MITA started scanning all government websites that utilised its infrastructure for the identification of vulnerabilities and subsequent rectification by the respective owners. A Client Protection Framework was developed to provide business owners with visibility on the security position in the areas for which they are responsible. This was an innovative project which re-designed the way the MITA sought to provide assurance to its clients that the infrastructure on which government data resided was adequately safeguarded from the ever-increasing threats defining today&#x2019;s cyberspace.&#xa0;The MITA heavily invested in cutting-edge technology to provide its clients with the ability to continuously scan for vulnerabilities and obtain real-time visibility on the operational health and security profile of environments hosted on its new Hybrid Cloud Enabling Infrastructure. Information security included three main dimensions: confidentiality, availability and integrity, and involved the application and management of appropriate security measures for a wide range of threats, with the aim of ensuring sustained business success and continuity, and minimising impacts of information security incidents (reference <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/66435.html">ISO/IEC 27000</a>). Additionally, The MITA invested in tools to aid in the detection and prevention of cybersecurity incidents, including adequate training of its employees throughout the organisation, and collaboration with other governmental departments to ensure a centralised and cohesive approach in this domain.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Launch of the National Cybersecurity Awareness and Education Campaign</p><p>On 16 October 2018, the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation, in the presence of the Minister for National Security and Home Affairs, launched the <a href="https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/resource_articles/launch-of-a-national-cyber-security-awareness-and-educational-campaign/">National Cybersecurity Awareness and Education Campaign</a>. As stated, the Campaign, which was one of the key goals of the National Cybersecurity Strategy published in 2016, was based on the government&#x2019;s belief in the need for the entire Maltese society to be fully aware of cyber risks and the security measures to be taken. The Campaign targeted the general public, the private sector as well as the public sector &#x2013; as the largest holder of critical and sensitive information &#x2013; through practical training and promotional initiatives.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Implementation of the NIS Directive </p><p>This legislation aims to improve the national security capability of the country; enhances cross-border collaboration between EU NIS national competent authorities; and upgrades national supervision of critical sectors.

The recommendations aim to support the business needs for the development of the Foundation to match the rapid pace of change led by market needs. The Strategy also aims to develop a number of measures to support a more evidence-based decision-making process. In addition, the Strategy puts forward several specific recommendations to address a number of currently developing market trends identified as part of the fieldwork done over the past year. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Development of Digital Skills in Compulsory Schooling</p><p>The <a href="https://digitalliteracy.skola.edu.mt/">Directorate for Digital Literacy and Transversal Skills</a> (DDLTS), within the Ministry for Education, identifies gaps in the digital skills of educators and supports them accordingly. The DDLTS coordinates support for educators to make use of various technologies that are available in schools and include them in their lessons in order to engage the students and facilitate learning. Students develop their critical and confident use of technologies and their digital competence. The DDLTS organises many initiatives in education to promote digital literacy, coding and computational thinking (like family coding sessions and the Code Week), internet safety, eTwinning, SELFIE and the implementation of DigComp within compulsory education.</p><p>The <a href="https://education.gov.mt/en/Pages/educ.aspx">Ministry for Education </a>is investing in digital skills in compulsory education curricula through the creation of ICT infrastructures in classrooms. </p><p>In primary schools, digital skills have been strengthened through the One Tablet per Child (OTPC) scheme, where tablets were distributed to all students and educators in year 4, 5 and 6 in all schools. The tablet is aimed to be an educational tool that helps students to enhance learning in literacy, digital literacy, numeracy, science and other areas. Students can learn anytime, anywhere because the tablet facilitates collaboration, communication, creativity, character education, digital citizenship, critical thinking and computational thinking. These competences are pushed forward through the digital learning outcomes, which are aligned with DigComp. The OTPC project aims to increase the skills and competences of students and future graduates; and to ensure that all children will be given a fair and equal opportunity to become familiar with technology. Digital skills are cross-curricular at all compulsory levels and students are expected to use technology across all subjects.&#xa0;</p><p>The Directorate for Learning and Assessment Programmes (DLAP) launched a new ICT programme in middle schools, entitled <a href="https://curriculum.gov.mt/en/syllabi_as_from_sept_2018/Documents/Year_07_08/ICT_syllabus_C3_yr07.pdf">ICT C3</a>, which has been introduced in year 7, to replace ECDL.&#xa0;The new ICT C3 programme goes on until year 11 to ensure that students learn about safety on the net, robotics, coding and other new technologies. This is a compulsory subject in lower and upper secondary education. Computing, VET IT and applied IT are optional subjects which students can study at secondary level. </p><p>With regard to transforming teaching and learning of digital skills in a lifelong learning perspective, including the training of teachers, the DDLTS is mainstreaming the EU&#x2019;s digital competence framework DIGCOMP (JRC, 2017) focusing on digital literacy and 21<sup>st</sup> century skills. The <a href="https://instituteforeducation.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Institute for Education</a> offers a whole range of CDP courses, including courses related to digital competences, in collaboration with the DDLTS. In the framework of the national project One Tablet per Child (OTPC), all educators in year 4, 5 and 6 have to follow the mandatory course &#x2018;Award in the use of tablets in primary classrooms&#x2019;. Professional development is also provided to all teachers involved in the ICT C3 programme, in computing, VET IT and applied IT. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Education at Further and Higher Education Level</p><p>The <a href="https://education.gov.mt/en/Pages/National-Skills-Council.aspx">National Skills Council</a> collaborated with the MCAST on the <a href="https://www.mcast.edu.mt/wp-content/uploads/MCAST-AI-StrategyFinal.pdf">strategy for AI in VET education</a>. The MCAST has launched its AI strategy that includes an update for all the ICT and non-ICT courses to cover relevant content on AI.</p><p>The Institute for Education is currently offering awards in the digital skills area. Anyone who meets the eligibility requirements can attend these courses. Such courses aim to upskill or help educators develop new competences.</p><ul><li><strong>Action research</strong>: the Centre engages with academic and professional researchers worldwide and brokers participation in research areas. Strategic alliances are being developed with universities, higher education institutions, consulting firms and the labour market, primarily in the Commonwealth and EU Member States. The Centre will commission action research in strategic and ideally high-profile areas of interest that resonate with target stakeholders. Research findings will be published through peer-reviewed, third-party publications as well as 3CL&#x2011;branded research reports to be published online under the most current version of the Creative Commons Attribution International (CC BY) licence. </li><li><strong>Praxis</strong>: the Centre facilitates, develops and shares high-profile pilots that can be replicated as use case studies. This process involves the activation and management of three interconnected pathways: peer-learning networks; connected learning principles and open education resources. Energised forms of digital scaffolding can shift the emphasis from policy discourse to praxis, helping learning institutions, teachers and learners acquire digital skills and learning methods. Providing learning support through the creation of relevant case studies can encourage education institutions to re-evaluate and implement much-needed change in curricula and modes of assessment.</li><li><strong>Advocacy for capacity building</strong>: the Centre is an advocate for connected learning and more inclusive approaches to education. In the process it builds capacity as a virtual incubator, integrating skills from different institutions and collaborating on strategic projects with clear &#x2018;needs&#x2019; and &#x2018;wants&#x2019;.</li></ul><p>The strategy is based on seven domains. At the core is the provisioning of data centre facilities which host the government&#x2019;s critical information systems and associated data, and the network infrastructure which provides a backbone for whole government. The second domain relates to information systems where the MITA designs, implements, maintains, and modernises both horizontal digital platforms and solutions, as well as vertical information systems used by the public administration. The third domain focuses on utilising innovative technologies and making the best use of data sharing and linking to facilitate projects such as Once-Only. </p><p>A key domain centres around information security, including the operations of a Security Operations Centre and the setting up of a National Coordination Centre. This domain also comprises Cyber Security activities and awareness programmes targeting different audiences.</p><p>A sixth domain relates to the external environment. The MITA provides various consultancy and project management services and a suite of digital solutions, which are based on its knowledge, competences, platforms, and tools. The Agency establishes strong relationships with various stakeholders, internal and external to the government. Finally, the strategy presents an internal domain; just like any other organisation, the MITA has several internal supporting functions and processes that are integral to its work. </p><p>Supporting the seven domains is the most important asset that the organisation has, its employees. The MITA has excellent resources in different areas and takes measures to motivate, develop and recognise them and to provide an environment where they can deliver.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Scholarships on Blockchain and DLTs</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Launch of the Emerging Technologies Lab</p><p>Following the launch of the MITA <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/portfolio/engagement-with-community-bringing-digital/emerging-technologies-lab/">Emerging Technologies Lab</a> in October 2018, with an investment of EUR 250,000, the Lab has provided an opportunity to explore and learn emerging technologies. With the purpose of promoting the various technologies available at the Lab and increasing the knowledge on these technologies, during the first two years of operations more than 50 events have been organised at the Lab. In 2020 most of these events have been shifted online. MITA employees, government employees, students, as well as private sector start-ups have the opportunity to develop their ideas in areas such as virtual and augmented realities; robotics and IoT through the use of 3D printing and microcontrollers; artificial intelligence and distributed ledger technologies. </p><p><img src="../html/img/35-441.jpeg" alt="A gavel on a desk

This law amended Cap. 546 to establish the Office of the Information and Data Protection Commissioner as the regulatory authority in Malta, and the Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) as the implementing entity, serving as the main co-ordinator and first line of call for any obligations arising out of the Act. The MITA was also entrusted to publish a standard and format for management of communications between the public administration and natural persons and/or organisations and establish the national data portal through which data discovery and data consumption services shall be provided, as may be applicable and authorised by the data owner. </p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Filing of Official Documentation</p><p>The electronic filing of official documentation is necessary for the purposes of processing by the public administration and judicial authorities.</p><p>From a judicial process point of view, the possibility to submit judicial acts by electronic means commenced in 2013 in the Small Claims Tribunal. This was followed, in 2015, by acts filed with the Administrative Review Tribunal and, in 2016, by judicial letters filed with the Courts of Malta and Gozo. Since 2015, summons issued by the Commissioners for Justice could be served through electronic mail.

Although this Directive replaces the PSI Directive, it is also being referred to as a &#x2018;recast directive&#x2019; wherein principles from the PSI Directive are retained and expanded on. In fact, the Recast Directive introduces the following changes:</p><ul><li>In addition to making available public sector information as Open Data, the Recast Directive adds the objective of increasing instances of data sharing and re-use through the introduction of concepts such as &#x2018;dynamic data&#x2019; made available through application protocol interfaces (API&#x2019;s) in real-time, including also the bulk-download option for the high value datasets where this facility can be made applicable;</li><li>The Recast Directive widens the scope of its applicability, including data held by public undertakings, research data obtained from public funding and what are known as &#x2018;high value data sets&#x2019; (geospatial, earth observation and environment, metrological, statistics, companies and company ownership and mobility) which will be further specified through Implementing Acts;</li><li>The Recast Directive enforces the principle that public data must be freely available for re-use. In fact, as a general rule all data are to be made available free of charge save for the exception to charge for marginal costs; and</li><li>In view of the above the Recast Directive also emphasises the importance of avoiding clauses in public contracts prohibiting the re-use/sharing of data. </li></ul><p>The provisions of the Recast Directive are envisaged to be transposed by an Amending Act to Cap. 546 of the Laws of Malta. The deadline for transposition is set for 17 July 2021.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eID Regulation</p><p>Malta was one of the first Member States to legislate in eCommerce by transposing the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&amp;from=EN" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">eSignatures Directive</a><span resource="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&amp;from=EN" property="eli:title" content="eSignatures Directive"/> into national law in 2001. The eCommerce Act was subsequently updated over the years to maintain its applicability to the digital market context, and most importantly was overhauled in 2016 to align with Regulation No. 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (the EIDAS Regulation). Today the <a href="https://www.mca.org.mt/general/trust-services-and-eid">national legislation on eID and trust services</a> is in line with the EIDAS Regulation and permits Malta to benefit from cross-border authentication and digital signing in eGovernment services.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Measures for a High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems (NIS Directive) </p><p>The NIS Directive was transposed into Maltese legislation through L.N. 216 of&#xa0;<a href="tel:+442018">2018</a>&#xa0;entitled &#x2018;<a href="https://maltacip.gov.mt/en/Legislation/Pages/Legal_Notice_216_of_2018.aspx">Measures for High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Order&#x2019;</a>.</p><p>The CIIP, within the CIP Directorate in the Ministry for Home Affairs, National Security and Law Enforcement, is the national competent authority (NCA) overseeing the implementation of the Order.

It outlined principles of good information/data handling to guarantee the protection of personal information. Data controllers, such as educational institutions, employers and banks, were obliged to inform individuals of the reasons for collecting information about them. Furthermore, individuals were assured that the data collected would not be used for any other reason than the purpose for which it was collected and were granted rights of access to the personal information held by the data controller.

The Directive mandated central government, government entities, local councils and regional authorities able to receive and process invoices electronically. Whilst the central government was mandated to be able to receive and process eInvoices by April 2019, other government entities, local councils and regional authorities were mandated to comply with the Directive by April 2020.</p><p>As part of the process, the <a href="https://mfin.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Ministry for Finance</a> and Employment (MFE) embarked on various local and EU initiatives. An eInvoicing Committee was chaired by the MFE with the participation of the Treasury, the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/">Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) </a>and other local representatives of the central government to oversee the smooth implementation of the Directive for central government, government entities and local councils. For government entities and local councils, the MFIN, together with the <a href="https://economy.gov.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx">Ministry for the Economy and Industry (MEI)</a>, launched a National eInvoicing Forum to promote and implement eInvoicing. At the EU level, Malta participated in the European Multi-Stakeholder Forum on Electronic Invoicing (EMSFEI). </p><p>The European Standard, emanating from the European Directive on electronic invoicing for public authorities (2014/55/EU), defines a semantic data model for a core invoice, compliant with this Directive. The data model of this European Standard contains many optional elements. However, specific countries, groups, or organisations may create individual specifications for the core invoice model, known as Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS), in their respective domains. One of the organisations that created an individual specification for the CIUS is OpenPEPPOL, which created the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0. Following a thorough business impact assessment of the core invoice data model as established by the European Standard, the government of Malta will be adopting the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 as its own CIUS, with no changes. To be able to do this, government decided to became an <a href="https://peppol.eu/about-openpeppol/">OpenPEPPOL</a> end-user member.</p><p>The adoption of the PEPPOL CIUS guaranteed a high degree of interoperability since several Member States adopted this CIUS or based their local CIUS on the PEPPOL model. It means that the government will incorporate the PEPPOL CIUS in its systems and will be able to receive eInvoices through the PEPPOL eDelivery network. Joining OpenPEPPOL was an important part of Malta&#x2019;s strategy to support compliance with the European eInvoicing Directive (2014/55/EU), making it easier for businesses to engage with the government online. </p><p>The Maltese government promoted the adoption of eInvoicing in its <a href="https://digitalmalta.org.mt/en/Documents/Digital Malta 2014 - 2020.pdf">Digital Malta National Strategy 2014-2020</a>. There is currently no eInvoicing platform in place in Malta. The <a href="https://treasury.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury Department</a> within the Ministry for Finance and Employment (MFE) is working on implementing a new Corporate Financial Management Solution (CFMS) across the central government, alongside an eInvoicing PEPPOL-compliant platform linking suppliers to the solution. The first phase of the end-to-end process of eInvoicing to the central government is expected to go live in fall/winter of 2021. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Invoicing in Public Procurement Regulations</p><p>The Electronic Invoicing in Public Procurement Regulations was adopted in 2018 by Malta (<a href="http://justiceservices.gov.mt/DownloadDocument.aspx?app=lp&amp;itemid=29397&amp;l=1">LN 404 of 2018</a>).</p><h2>Domain-specific legislation</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Legal Notice on Justice </p><p>Through a <a href="https://www.gov.mt/en/Government/DOI/Press Releases/Pages/2018/December/14/pr182715.aspx">legal notice</a> entering into force in December 2018, the government of Malta continued to implement further reforms related to information in the justice sector.

The availability of this network enabled the government to launch its eGovernment services. A new network, &#x201c;MAGNET II&#x201d;, was launched in July 2005 and partly replaced MAGNET. This new state&#x2011;of-the-art network presented a number of benefits for users compared to its predecessor.

The government operates a number of identity management systems, the most important of which are: core database systems, electronic identity (eID) infrastructure, an electoral system, a national identity card system and the passport system. However, it should be noted that these and other disparate information systems are not entirely interoperable.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Identity</p><p>To keep the eID solution secure, robust and stable for eGovernment service continuity, the MITA approved in 2014 a technology upgrade for the solution that included a migration to a newer and fully supported hosting platform, and an alignment of the software development platform to recent versions. The technology upgrade included the first phase of simplification of the authentication mechanism through the introduction of a new single sign-on screen for a harmonised user experience and additional security. In parallel, several high-level consultations were held to discuss the potential successive phases of simplification.</p><p>The technology<strong> </strong>upgrade for the eID solution was completed in 2016. The migration to the new environment resulted in a noticeable improvement in performance and stability and was achieved with no disruption to the subscribers and the relying parties. The new single sign-on screen was also launched, following a complete re-engineering of the user interface and functionality to achieve the desired simplification. This simplification in the user experience was accompanied by a complete overhaul of the registration and activation processes where the reliance on the PIN letter was removed in favour an electronic activation process. Several eGovernment services, notably servizz.gov, eForms, myHealth, taxation, Automated Revenue Management Services (ARMS) and social security have since lined up to integrate with the new screen to achieve the desired outcomes.</p><p>In 2017, the MITA completed the final phase of the simplification of the eID authentication mechanism, which envisaged an alignment of the assurance levels to achieve a basic assurance level using the eID account and password, and a high assurance level using the ID card and PIN. This provided a better choice of usability or security for subscribers and relying parties. The basic assurance level was intended to have a password with reduced mandatory complexity with an optional one-time password. The high assurance level potentially involved additional usability challenges in view of the initial set up and installation of the ID card, but still provided the additional security required.</p><p>In 2019, an optional two-factor authentication mechanism for eID based on a time-based one-time password (TOTP) mechanism was introduced, intended for specific eGovernment services which require a substantial level of assurance. Support for the OpenID Connect Protocol to facilitate better access from native mobile applications was also introduced. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Identity Cards (eID Card)</p><p>The eID Card is an identity card which, in addition to the traditional identification features, also includes an electronic component which allows citizens to access an array of electronic services provided by the government and other third parties.</p><p>Maltese nationals who are 14 years of age and older are entitled to an eID Card. The card&#x2019;s electronic features are available to all card holders with one exception: the signature certificate is only available to citizens aged 18 years and older.</p><p>The electronic chip of the eID card holds the same biographic data that are visible on the face of the card, including a digital image of the citizen. The chip includes two digital certificates for authentication and signatures, and applications for ticketing and electronic purse.</p><p>The digital certificate for authentication enables the citizen to log in securely to eGovernment services. The digital certificate for signatures is an enabler for electronic signatures. These are qualified certificates under the eCommerce Act and the electronic signature will be equivalent to a hand-written signature. Both certificates are protected by different Personal Identification Numbers (PINs).</p><p>The eID Card can be used by citizens to securely access their health information through eGovernment services but does not hold any sensitive health data. An eID account is required to access health information through the myHealth Portal. No fingerprint biometric data is held on the eID Card, which does not replace the voting document issued by the Electoral Commission, either.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ePassports</p><p>Passports issued as from the 1 October 2008 are all ePassports. These first generations of electronic passports had a BAC (Basic Access Control) chip. The biometrics captured were a photo image and a signature. As from 1 July 2010, the ePassports&#x2019; chip was upgraded to EAC (Extended Access Control). Fingerprints were added to the biometrics captured.</p><p>On 30 March 2015, the ePassports&#x2019; chip was upgraded to SAC (Supplemental Access Control). However, the same biometrics were captured as the chip is the latest third generation to date.</p><p>The main reasons that led to the introduction of an ePassport were to:</p><ul><li>Prevent fight passport fraud;</li><li>Reduce passport forgery;</li><li>Facilitate more robust border controls; and</li><li>Establish a link with the lawful owner.</li></ul><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Public Procurement System Platform</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Department of Contracts Portal</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">MITA Procurement Website</p><p>The MITA, the other Central Purchasing Body besides the DoC, maintains a <a href="mailto:https://procurement.mita.gov.mt/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="procurement-dedicated website" resource="mailto:https://procurement.mita.gov.mt/">procurement-dedicated website</a> that allows greater interaction on its public calls for tenders through a mobile responsive design. The website also provides an outlook forecast on upcoming calls for tenders scheduled to be issued by the agency, and provides procurement-related resources, including those related to the dynamic purchasing systems established by the agency.</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ePayment Gateway</p><p>The eGovernment <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/portfolio/information-systems/government-payment-gateway/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="electronic payment gateway" resource="https://mita.gov.mt/portfolio/information-systems/government-payment-gateway/">electronic payment gateway</a> is part of the horizontal infrastructure supporting the Maltese eGovernment. It complements the eID framework in providing a layer for the development of eServices for both citizens and businesses. The service is provided both as standalone, hence portals or mobile applications that directly integrate to the gateway, or through other set platforms, such as eForms.</p><ul><li>3D secure enabling for all merchants;</li><li>REST API stack provision to widen the services for mobile payments including continued eWallet support for merchants;</li><li>Introduction of merchant initiated transactions;</li><li>Continued strengthening of the infrastructure; and</li><li>Facilitating integration through revised and refreshed documentation.</li></ul><p>This was done to continue to instil trust in the payment gateway with the aim of increasing uptake and usage.</p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">My Personal Kiosk</p><p>&#x200b;<a href="http://www.mypersonalkiosk.gov.mt" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="my personal kiosk" resource="http://www.mypersonalkiosk.gov.mt">My Personal Kiosk</a> is the eAdministration service launched in 2018 to provide public service employees with the opportunity to access their leave balances (sick and vacation), view their payslips and FS3 for the last three years. Additionally, employees can check their basic HR details as currently available at the People &amp; Standards Division. The service is sourcing information from the back-end HR and payroll systems.</p><p>The intranet for the public service is available to all government departments/entities and their employees. Intra.gov.mt, through a collaboration platform, provides any participating government department/entity the facility to share activities such as document management and workflows that address the internal business requirements of the specific department/entity. Amongst others, the intranet holds information such as circulars, news, events, directives, newsletters, vacancies, management resources, courses and scholarships and is restricted to public service officials. All the eAdministration services launched in 2018 are included on the intranet.</p><h2>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Deployment of Cross-border eHealth Services </p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Contracts Register</p><p>The Maltese government has embarked on the implementation of a Contracts Register based on the <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="world bank&#x2019;s open contracting data standard" resource="http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/">World Bank&#x2019;s Open Contracting Data Standard</a> and has now also fully implemented the electronic integration of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/e-procurement/espd_en" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="european single procurement document" resource="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/e-procurement/espd_en">European Single Procurement Document</a> (ESPD) and integration with <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/tools/ecertis/#/homePage" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="ecertis" resource="https://ec.europa.eu/tools/ecertis/#/homePage">eCERTIS</a> and National Registers. The first is a significant statement on transparency, whereas the second continues to automate processes and enshrines the Once-Only principle. </p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">MDIA certification programme</p><p>The MDIA has in place a certification programme which certifies the underlying technology being used by a particular software. The aim of this is to provide better assurance (and therefore trust) to the user by ascertaining that the software is doing what it is meant to do. </p><p>The MDIA&#x2019;s services of certification can be sought by either public or private entities. Certification can be mandated as a requirement by any lead authority governing the respective business, as it truly understands the associated business risks should a particular technology malfunction (either maliciously, through design or by defect). </p><p>The guidelines, and other relevant documents, that are to be followed by prospective systems auditors and innovative technology arrangements that seek to make use of the Authority&#x2019;s services can be accessed through the Authority&#x2019;s portal. Moreover, the MDIA is also overseeing the implementation of the National AI Strategy, which was launched in 2019. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Applied Research </p><p>The MITA has set up a new applied research function with the purpose of using existing knowledge and technologies in an innovative way to address business problems within the MITA or public administration. These initiatives will be used as a vehicle to develop proof of concepts and promote the further take-up of emerging technologies. The approach being adopted for such initiatives is to source untested problems from various business areas that could possibly lead to improvements if resolved through the implementation of a technology solution. The role of academic institutions and/or technology partners is to provide the research-based evidence of the best approach to be adopted in the respective case, and the actual building of the proof of concept. The involvement of academic institutions is key for the MITA to benefit from knowledgeable researchers and for research output to be implemented. Where applicable, the MITA will make resources available through the Emerging Technologies Lab for such projects to have the necessary backing.</p><p>The ultimate aim of such function is to increase the use of technology for the benefit of citizens and businesses. Since the technology would not have been applied in such a way before, the development of the proof of concept will be the first step to take the project forward for actual implementation. The knowledge gained will be used as input for the justification of the project or the adoption of alternative methods. Independent from the decision on whether to proceed with the project implementation, the knowledge gained by the MITA, public administration, and partners can be used to solve other similar problems. In addition, the investment in such an initiative will strengthen and increase the research and innovation aspects of the country.</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-627.jpeg" alt="A person holding a trophy
