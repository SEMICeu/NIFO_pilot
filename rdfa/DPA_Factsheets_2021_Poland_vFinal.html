The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategy for Responsible Development</p><p>The Strategy for Responsible Development for the period up to 2020 (including the perspective up to 2030) determines basic conditions, objectives and directions for the country development in social, economic, environmental and territorial terms for 2020 and 2030. The main objective of the strategy is to create the conditions for an increase in the income of Polish citizens while increasing social, economic, environmental and territorial cohesion. The key indicators of the strategy include the GDP per capita growth up to 95% of EU28 by 2030 and a drop in the risk of poverty and social exclusion indicator to 17 by 2030.</p><p>Ensuring a high and stable growth rate will be facilitated by the implementation of the following measures among others:</p><ul><li>Total investment growth to account for 22-25% of the GDP by 2020 and 25% by 2030;</li><li>Increase in the share of R&amp;D expenditures to 1.7% of the GDP by 2020 and 2.5% by 2030;</li><li>Average annual growth rate of exports of 7.2% by 2020 and 6.8% by 2030;</li><li>A 10% share of advanced technology products in total exports by 2020 and 15% by 2030. </li></ul><p>The main objectives include eGovernment measures, particularly those involving the effective use of ICT in the public administration. </p><p>The concept of eGovernment and digital public services imply that high-quality services for citizens, including entrepreneurs, are to be provided by modern IT solutions supporting a logical and coherent government IT system, developed and maintained with the cooperation of all actors at various levels of public administration.</p><p>A priority task in the field of eGovernment is to allow the widest possible range of public services to be provided digitally, thereby enabling citizens to handle their businesses remotely. It will be necessary to ensure the interoperability of public IT systems and to computerise the internal processes of the administration.</p><p>This strategy sets out the following measures:</p><ul><li>Providing eServices relevant for citizens and entrepreneurs;</li><li>Creating a single information and eServices website for the government administration;</li><li>Introducing a uniform and secure system for identifying citizens (eID) in the eServices systems of the public administration;</li><li>Ensuring a dominant share of digital document flow on administration and economic trade;</li><li>Increasing access to public sector information, including through interfaces for software developers;</li><li>Adopting a standard for digital documentation management systems in public administration, guaranteeing an efficient exchange of information with the public administration&#x2019;s domain-specific systems;</li><li>Integrating the eGovernment data processing infrastructure and the development of a State register system, ensuring the necessary reliability and availability of eGovernment systems and their integration.</li></ul><p>There are other elements linking this strategy to the EC&#x2019;s Digital Single Market Strategy, whose implementation is governed and monitored be the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.</p><p>While the implementation of the fundamental objectives of this strategy continues, a certain correction of the specific objectives and mechanisms of the implementation programme has been elaborated in the form of the post-pandemic New Deal Programme, which responds to the changes in the geopolitics and the global economy. <a href="http://www.kprm.gov.pl/">The programme</a> was announced in the spring of 2021.</p><p>In particular, the Council took note of:</p><ul><li>Low fixed broadband coverage;</li><li>Relatively low efficiency of public administration;</li><li>Relatively low level of use of eGovernment;</li><li>Very low percentage of adults who engage in lifelong learning.</li></ul><p>The report recommended the development of broadband networks and the improvement in the quality and efficiency of public services through digitalisation. The method for implementing eServices includes mechanisms to prevent the phenomenon of &#x2018;digitalisation bureaucracy&#x2019;, forcing the positive impact of projects on administrative processes, and to train as many people as possible in the use of ICT to improve their quality of life, also socially, and increase the competitiveness of the labour market. By the end of 2020, 580&#xa0;000 households were connected to high-speed internet. Human capital related actions resulted in 227&#xa0;540 people trained in using internet, including eServices and more than 121 300 acquiring increased digital competences. In the area of eAdministration, 99 new public eServices and 87 new databases accessible through API were provided. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Integrated Informatisation Programme</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-zintegrowanej-informatyzacji-panstwa">National Integrated Informatisation Programme (PZIP)</a> was adopted in January 2014.

The Open Data Programme aims to develop an ecosystem in which a large amount of good quality data will allow for the development of innovative solutions, increase the transparency of the activities of administrative bodies and increase the quality of research, accelerating scientific progress.</p><p>In 2019, as a continuation of the project &#x2018;Open data - standard access, education&#x2019; a new project called Open Data Plus was inaugurated. Under the project, new data sets are released through API and two new tools are established within the Chancellery of the Prime Minister to support the opening of public data, i.e. Open Data Laboratory (technical and legal advice) and Open Data Academy (trainings).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Data Standards</p><p>In 2018, the former Ministry of Digital Affairs (now the Chancellery of the Prime Minister) published <a href="https://dane.gov.pl/knowledge-base/education/1220">guidelines</a> to prepare and share data for reuse. The guidelines concerned the Application Programming Interface (API) standard, the security standard, the technical standard, and the legal standard. In 2018, the Ministry of Digital Affaires elaborated them to ensure that data provided by the public administration would be of a higher quality. Public open data standards for the administration were developed as part of the project &#x2018;Open data &#x2013; access, standard, education&#x2019;. Open data may now be reused for research or business purposes. Opening public data makes public administration activities more transparent and allows civic control thereover. </p><p>In 2019, open data standards were subject to extensive public consultations. Most of the proposals submitted during the consultations were implemented in the new versions of the documents published in 2020. This will trigger an increase in the quality of data provided by the administration and used in innovative products and services.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>The strategy defines five specific objectives that should be fulfilled by the government: </p><ul><li>Developing the national cybersecurity system (including the adoption of the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act into the Polish legal system); </li><li>Increasing the level of resilience of information systems of the public administration and private sector, and achieving the capacity to effectively prevent and respond to incidents; </li><li>Increasing the national capacity in the area of cybersecurity technology; </li><li>Raising public awareness and competences in the area of cybersecurity; </li><li>Ensuring the Republic of Poland has a strong international position in the area of cybersecurity.</li></ul><p>In addition, its strategy is in line with the obligations laid down in the NIS Directive with regard to the adoption of the national cybersecurity strategies by Member States.

The possibility of automatic verification of data provided by persons using public services with reference data from public registers will allow to improve the current work of public entities, which are obliged to perform the tasks specified in the law, and at the same time will speed up the settlement of matters. </p><p>The PESEL (Personal Data Register) shall be a reference set of data about citizens. It is necessary to introduce and enforce principles for limiting to the necessary minimum the range of data which will be required from the citizen when dealing with official matters. Units keeping registers must have the obligation of mutual exchange of information, and direct information requests from registered entities should only be possible if the data obtained from other records are insufficient. From 1 January 2022, government administration bodies and law enforcement bodies, courts, organisational units of the prosecutor&#x2019;s office, local government units and their bodies that keep a public register using ICT systems will have to verify the data entered with the data in the PESEL.</p><p>Two-way communication between secondary and primary records (supplied directly with data obtained from the registered entities) should be provided. A modern and secure IT infrastructure, built on robust integrated tele-information systems, is now the basis for the functioning of offices and the exchange of information between offices and citizens, as well as the offices themselves and other public bodies.

These in particular include:</p><ul><li>A series of seven conferences on the &#x2018;<em>Prospects for IoT development in Poland &#x2013; Self-Governments of the Future&#x2019;</em> organised in co-operation with the Chancellery of the President&#xa0;of Poland (January&#x2013;June 2020); </li><li>Sharing a one-access-point library with information on a variety of funds available for innovative solutions;  </li><li>Encouraging local governments to contribute to <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/mapa-innowacji">the Map of Innovations in Poland</a> covering examples of application of new technologies (IoT/AI) in local government units, scientific units and/or public administration institutions.</li><li>Additionally, in 2020 the Chancellery analysed - in co-operation with the Ministry for Justice, the Ministry of Finance, the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection and the Polish Financial Supervision Authority - issues raised by the IoT Working Group relating to lack of regulations regarding IoT devices liability, esp. B2B and B2A trade relations.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Blockchain</p><p>The Working Group on DLT/Blockchain gathers a wide representation of blockchain market stakeholders. They are interested in ensuring adequate conditions for the development of blockchain solutions in various sectors of the economy, as well as in the public sector, by identifying market areas where State involvement might be both expected and necessary.</p><p>It serves as a platform for cross-sectoral cooperation, where different points of view, interests, as well as legal, regulatory, organisational and cultural conditions can be explored and discussed. This has already become an opportunity to expand the field of debate and support discussions of specialised financial market regulators on the Capital Market Development Strategy or fintech. The works resulted in <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/digitalization/working-group-on-dlt-and-blockchain">four white papers</a> published in March 2020: Token as Bond, Electronic Promissory Notes and Bills of Exchange &#x2013; Blockchain, Electronic Seal in business transactions, GDPR and Blockchain.</p><p> </p><p>Similar fields of debate arise and will be developed in other markets where the State can help through regulation, law or pilot implementation: real estate, energy and supply chain. The working group also prepared legislative proposals on these matters, as well as a common legal position for the use of fintech barriers discussed within the Financial Regulatory Authority.

It granted citizens and businesses the right to contact public authorities electronically. It set up horizontal/infrastructure programmes for all sectors of public administration and established a national interoperability framework for IT systems in the Polish public sector. </p><p>This law was essential for the standardisation and interoperability of public administration systems, front and back-office integration of public administration systems, in particular the <a href="https://epuap.gov.pl/wps/portal/english">Electronic Platform of Public Administration Services (ePUAP)</a>, the central repository of electronic document templates, and the supervision and support of IT projects in public administration at both central and local levels. Moreover, it established the public electronic identification scheme under which two electronic identification means for natural persons are issued. It also enabled citizens to confirm their identity or rights (e.g. for driving licenses) using a mobile device instead of documents intended for this.</p><p>The last amendment in 2019 also introduced in the law the System of State Registers as an organisational and technical tool serving public registers. The act obliged the Minister of Digital Affairs to determine technological standards for the System of State Registers, including standards for data exchange between registers. The entities managing public registers are obliged by the act to verify data which are registered for the first time with data in the Personal Register Data (PESEL).</p><p>A new amendment is under preparation aiming at introducing digital default to the way the administration operates. The amendment will set out common rules for public entities including digital documents and electronic communication by default in administration and economy (the primacy of electronic communication), the possibility of using only one means of electronic identification (the principle of one login for every citizen and entrepreneur), the use of one gateway to public services (<a href="https://www.gov.pl/">GOV.PL</a>), as well as solutions limiting data redundancy and data exchange of public ICT systems.

The aim of the act is to enable public entities to provide as many electronic services as possible within the administration and to introduce solutions ensuring the exchange of registered correspondence with citizens and entrepreneurs by means of the trust services. As a result, from 1 July 2021 people who express such a wish will be able to receive registered correspondence from administration institutions without having to go to the post office. eDelivery will be the legal equivalent to sending a traditional registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt or delivering in person. Along with the adoption of the Act, the electronic delivery service standard was completed. This is the document standardising the manner of providing these services by service providers, including the designated operator. The registered electronic delivery standard has been published on the <a href="https://mc.bip.gov.pl/ogloszenia/standard-publicznej-uslugi-rejestrowanego-doreczenia-elektronicznego-swiadczonej-przez-operatora-wyznaczonego-i-kwalifikowanych-dostawcow-uslug.html">BIP website of the Ministry of Digital Affairs</a>.</p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Regulation on the National Interoperability Framework</p><p>The <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WDU20170002247/O/D20172247.pdf" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Regulation on the National Interoperability Framework</a><span resource="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WDU20170002247/O/D20172247.pdf" property="eli:title" content="Regulation on the National Interoperability Framework"/>, minimum requirements for public registers and information exchange in electronic form and minimum requirements for ICT systems, adopted on 12 April 2012 by the Council of Ministers, was further amended in 2014, 2016 and 2017. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act on the Computerisation of the Operations of the Entities Performing Public Tasks</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland has been working on the amendment to the <a href="http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20050640565" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Act on the Computerisation of Entities Performing Public Tasks.</a><span resource="http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20050640565" property="eli:title" content="Act on the Computerisation of Entities Performing Public Tasks."/> The amended act will set out provisions related to e.g. reference data, interoperability recommendations, interoperability repository, thus recognising the importance of interoperability key concepts and definitions that are currently defined in the Regulation on the Polish National Interoperability Framework.

This legislation defined the national cybersecurity system and the tasks and responsibilities of the entities in the system. The purpose of the national cybersecurity system was to ensure cybersecurity at national level, including the uninterrupted provision of essential services and digital services, by achieving an appropriate level of security involving the information systems used to provide these services, and by providing for incident handling. The act also specified:</p><ul><li>The scope of the Polish National Cybersecurity Strategy;</li><li>The establishment of a Single Point of Contact for cyber security run by the minister competent for digitalisation;</li><li>The institution of the Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity responsible for the coordination of activities and implementation of the government policy in the field of cybersecurity;</li><li>The creation of an Advisory Committee operating in the Council of Ministers, in the capacity of consultative and advisory body in matters of cybersecurity;</li><li>The establishment of three CSIRTs at national level and seven competent authorities responsible for cybersecurity within essential sectors in Poland (listed in the annex to the act);</li><li>The addition of the public administration to the system with regard to incident handling and reporting;</li></ul><p>Poland has almost completed the identification and designation of operators of essential services. Moreover, the effective cooperation and coordination mechanisms are in place. Additionally, one legal act (secondary legislation) &#x2013; an ordinance of the Minister of Digital Affairs on organisational and technical conditions for entities providing cybersecurity services and internal organisational structures of operators of essential services responsible for cybersecurity &#x2013; was amended due to market needs.</p><p>The government decided to maintain and develop its decentralised approach towards a governance structure of its cybersecurity system. There is a clear division of responsibilities and capabilities between all the involved institutions established pursuant to the act. The act allowed the creation of an efficient, comprehensive system enabling stakeholders to detect, prevent, and mitigate the impact of incidents that affected Polish national interests, while helping crucial societal and economic activities.  </p><p>The act created a coherent incident response system based on the leading role of three Computer Security Incident Response Teams at national level (CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK and CSIRT GOV) with a certain and clear division of constituencies. </p><p>The Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity, responsible for the coordination of the activities and the implementation of the government policy in the field of cybersecurity, was set up together with an Advisory Committee for Cybersecurity operating at the Council of Ministers, in the capacity of a consultative and advisory body in matters of cybersecurity and relevant activities of CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK, CSIRT GOV, the sectoral cybersecurity teams and the competent authorities for cybersecurity.

From November 2018, all public administrations began accepting (structured) electronic invoices. Two years later, this obligation fell upon all entrepreneurs participating in public procurement. The long-term goal, however, was to consult with stakeholders to change national and EU VAT rules, in order to receive electronic invoices as a default mode in B2B and B2C relations.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on Public Procurement </p><p>The <a href="https://www.uzp.gov.pl/en" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law on Public Procurement</a><span resource="https://www.uzp.gov.pl/en" property="eli:title" content="Law on Public Procurement"/> entered into force in March 2004. It enabled the development of eProcurement systems for Polish public administrations, the use of advanced electronic signatures in the submission of tenders, and the use of electronic auctions for certain contracts. In April 2006, the Public Procurement Law was largely amended in order to implement the provisions of the EU Directives on public procurement (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0017:EN:HTML">2004/17/EC</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0018:EN:HTML">2004/18/EC</a>), including those relating to electronic auctions and the Dynamic Purchasing System. This amended version placed electronic communications between the awarding entity and the economic operator on the same level as written or fax communications, regardless of the procurement procedure in question. Furthermore, it defined cases where transferred data must be supplied with a qualified electronic signature. In 2017, the Public Procurement Law was amended again to include the changes introduced by the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20160001579" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification</a><span resource="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20160001579" property="eli:title" content="Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification"/> of 5 September 2016.</p><p>On 1 January 2021, the new <a href="https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2019/2019" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Public Procurement Law</a><span resource="https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2019/2019" property="eli:title" content="Public Procurement Law"/> came into force. Following the EU Directives on public procurement (2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU), this law provides that all public procurement procedures must be electronic. This obligation applies to all proceedings, regardless of their value. The rules of the new Public Procurement Law take into account the currently applicable solutions for electronic communications.

The main goal of the project was to create an application in which documents and services are made available which are useful for citizens. Initially, the application provided the mIdentity service, an electronic document used to confirm the identity of a citizen in many everyday-life situations. </p><p>In 2018, a school mLegitimacy and a student mLegitimacy were launched, which are a replica of traditional ID cards and give the right to discounts and reductions. More than 32&#xa0;000 pupils and students already use these documents. Another service was launched for drivers - mPojazd. It presents information about the car, including the mandatory insurance and the technical inspection of the vehicle. </p><p>Subsequently, the former Ministry of Digital Affairs in cooperation with the Ministry of Health made the eReception service available. It enables access to issued prescriptions and facilitates their use. Additionally, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a new service called a &#x2018;Polish person abroad&#x2019; was launched, dedicated to travellers, containing information on living conditions, threats and customs in particular countries. </p><p>The mCitizen application can be used with a smartphone, with Android and iOS operating systems. By the end of 2020, the number of application users amounted to over 2 million. </p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Trusted Profile</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Qualified Trust Service Providers</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ID Card with Electronic Layer</p><p>The eID card is a secure tool containing certificates enabling electronic identification (an electronic identification means called personal profile) and the creation of an advanced electronic signature (called personal signature). It may contain a qualified electronic signature from a trust service provider (chosen by the holder). Moreover, the ICAO application is also implemented in the identity card.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Electronic Identification Node</p><p>The <a href="https://login.gov.pl/login/main" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="national electronic identification node" resource="https://login.gov.pl/login/main">National Electronic Identification Node</a> provides convenient access to public portals and eServices. It is an organisational and technical solution that integrates IT systems at a single point in which public online services are made available, with various electronic identification schemes (provided by public or private entities). Users using electronic identification means issued in electronic identification schemes connected to the National Electronic Identification Node can authenticate in any public online services. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Commercial Certification Authorities Certificates</p><p>Qualified and unqualified certification authorities (CAs) issue electronic identifiers to individual persons. These identifiers are usually Integrated Circuit Cards (ICC) with crypto-controller, private cryptographic keys and public key certificates installed inside or software-based tokens. In the case of eGovernment systems and applications, the most frequently used identifiers are the ones with qualified public key certificates. Electronic signatures with unqualified certificates are rarely used, and their use is mainly limited to message authentication, authentication of servers, workstations, and other IT equipment.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Commercial eSignatures</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Procurement Office Portal</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Information on the Polish Public Procurement System</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing Infrastructure</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Court Payments</p><p>The <a href="http://www.zgierz.sr.gov.pl/e-platnosci-nowy-system-elektronicznych-oplat-sadowych,new,mg,1.html,79" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="electronic court payments" resource="http://www.zgierz.sr.gov.pl/e-platnosci-nowy-system-elektronicznych-oplat-sadowych,new,mg,1.html,79">Electronic Court Payments</a> is a system that allows users to pay court fees electronically.

So far, Polish citizens have been able to use electronic identification means connected to the national node only in national eServices. Foreign nationals cannot use their national eID in Polish eServices.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Single Point of Contact</p><p>The Single Point of Contact is a communication interface (node) between Schengen Member States or Associated States. It allows for effective online communication, leading to regular implementation of tasks related to the exchange of cryptographic keys. In general, it will be used to exchange certificates between all countries of the Schengen area, which will enable the services (most often the Border Guard) to verify travel documents (usually passports). Suspicious persons (or suspects) will be subject to further verification of fingerprints with imprints placed in the document.</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">System of State Registers </p><p>The System of State Registers (SSR) combines six registers: PESEL (Personal Data Register), Registry of Civil Status, ID Cards Register, System of State Awards, Central Register of Objections and Contact Information Registry. The interconnections between each of them allow for the provision of new services. The System of State Registers is constantly developed and improved. Millions of operations take place annually involving data such as names, surnames, addresses, identity documents, citizenships, marital status, death and birth data. The registers in the SSR include referential data which are made available for other registers and exchange the information with each other. In 2021, it is planned to include another register in the SSR: the Passport Document Register. Work has also commenced on the creation of a Central Register of Voters to facilitate the handling of elections. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Registry of Sexual Crimes</p><p>The <a href="https://bip.ms.gov.pl/pl/rejestry-i-ewidencje/rejestr-sprawcow-przestepstw-na-tle-seksualnym/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="registry of sexual crimes" resource="https://bip.ms.gov.pl/pl/rejestry-i-ewidencje/rejestr-sprawcow-przestepstw-na-tle-seksualnym/">Registry of Sexual Crimes</a> is a public database containing information about the most dangerous perpetrators of sexual crimes.
