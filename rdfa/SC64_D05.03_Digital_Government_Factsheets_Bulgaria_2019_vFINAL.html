Digital Post refers to the possibility that governments communicate electronically-only with citizens or entrepreneurs through e.g. personal mailboxes or other digital mail solutions.</li></ul><p>These top-level benchmarks are measured using a life-events (e.g. mystery shopping) approach. Eight life events are included in the overall eGovernment performance score. Four of these life events were measured in 2013, 2015 and 2017 and the other four were measured in 2012, 2014, 2016, and again in 2018. The life events measured in 2017 were Regular business operations, Moving, Owning and driving a car and Starting a small claims procedure. The life events measured in 2018 are Business start-up, Losing and finding a job, Family life and Studying.</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-400.png" alt="35-400.png" class="keepElement"/></p><p property="dct:source" href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/egovernment-benchmark-2018-digital-efforts-european-countries-are-visibly-paying">Source: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/egovernment-benchmark-2018-digital-efforts-european-countries-are-visibly-paying">eGovernment Benchmark Report 2018 Country Factsheets </a></p><h1><a id="_Toc13221560"/>Digital Government Highlights</h1><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Government Political Communications</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Government Legislation</p><ul><li>The law amending and supplementing the <a href="http://www.aop.bg/fckedit2/user/File/en/Normativna baza/zop_eng_new.pdf">Public Procurement Act</a> introduced mandatory use of the National Electronic Platform, from the opening of the procedures to the receipt and opening of electronic applications for participation and tenders, as well as for electronic communications in the course of the procurement procedure.</li><li>The <a href="http://blog.apis.bg/2018/11/polezno-v-dv-br-94-ot-13-11-2018-g/">Cybersecurity Act</a> was adopted in pursuance of the commitments of the Republic of Bulgaria as a Member State of the European Union to establish an organization for the implementation of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2016/1148/oj">Directive (EU) 2016/1148</a> concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Government Governance</p><p>No new changes in digital government governance were reported.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Government Infrastructure</p><p>For the purposes of cross-border electronic identification, an eIDAS Node was developed and deployed in a production environment in accordance with the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 910/2014.</p><p>The <a href="https://data.egov.bg/">Open Data Portal</a> was created.

It was developed and maintained by the administration of the Council of Ministers under Art. 15c, para. 1 of the Access to Public Information Act (APIA). The platform is a unified, central, public web-based information system that electronically provides the entire process of filing and processing of applications for access to information. It forwarded to competent bodies the relevant information according to the Access to Public Information Act, while at the same time protecting the applicant&apos;s personal data under the Personal Data Protection Act.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">UPAEAS</p><p>The <a href="https://egov.bg/wps/portal/en">unified portal for access to electronic administrative services (UPAEAS)</a> - constitutes an entry point to the services delivered by electronic administrative service providers.

Both constitute the backbone for the implementation of the provisions for digital transmission needs of public institutions as a <a href="https://e-gov.bg/bg/systems/eesm">unified communications network</a>. Responsibility for the management of the merged network resides with the State eGovernment Agency (SEGA).</p><p>The Public Administration, by building a unified communications network, sees an opportunity to effectively reduce the cost of central and local executive authorities for telecommunications services and operational costs. This will facilitate the transfer of funds for the development, maintenance and operation of infrastructure. </p><p>The Government aims to create a single, public communication and information infrastructure that will enable the country to: introduce eGovernment; apply video surveillance in public places, intersections, important buildings and schools; provide eLearning, eAgriculture, eCommerce, eHealth, eTourism and eInclusion to disadvantaged people.</p><p>The decision to build a national <a href="http://cio.bg/5735/">Unified Electronic Communications Network (EESM)</a> was adopted on 10 December 2006. EESM is built on two levels - the backbone network (Backbone) and Access Networks (<em>Metromrezhi</em>).</p><p>In August 2003, the backbone of the communication system of the Public Administration was the National Network of the Public Administration (NAMDA). At that time, it comprised 27 regional networks of the Public Administration based on regional cities.</p><p>NAMDA was planned to be merged with MPD, the data network of the Ministry of Finance, and connected to the EU&#x2019;s TESTA II private IP-based network.</p><p>The NAMDA and ESM networks were united under the unified Single Electronic Communication Network in 2011.

The provision of these services is achieved via the <a href="http://regixaisweb.egov.bg/regixinfo">Registry Information Exchange System</a> (RegiX).
