This strategy describes how the Swedish government plans to further strengthen the ability of government agencies to work together in delivering digital services. More common digital services in the daily lives of both citizens and businesses have been further simplified. These digital services shall be developed in a user-centric way: simple, secure to use and easily accessible to everyone. Innovation has been enhanced by making it easier to find and use reusable public information and digital services with interfaces that can be operated by other systems. The publication of public sector information on the internet and the use of social media have promoted both transparency and citizen involvement. Quality and efficiency in government administration have been increased through standardised information management, better information security and digitised processes. Such internal efficiency in developing digital services must always be conditional on the protection of personal privacy and the need for confidentiality. The above-mentioned objectives have formed the basis of the Swedish government&#x2019;s coordinated and overriding development of inter&#x2011;agency cross-sectorial projects. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Development for the Digital Age - A New Strategy for Local and Regional Governments</p><p>In 2019, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) adopted a <a href="https://skr.se/naringslivarbetedigitalisering/digitalisering/strategifordigitalutveckling.6728.html">new strategy</a> for digital government, aiming to align efforts related to digital development in SALAR, the Swedish municipalities and regions, as well as in the SALAR groups Adda (formerly named <a href="https://www.sklkommentus.se/">SKL Kommentus</a>) and <a href="https://www.inera.se/">Inera AB</a>. The strategy is aligned with the Swedish framework for digital collaboration and the European Interoperability Framework (EIF).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Strategy for Data </p><p>In October 2021, the government adopted a <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/4aa1b8/contentassets/56abce3c5f6447a1a285602718b86ad1/data--en-underutnyttjad-resurs-for-sverige-en-strategi-for-okad-tillgang-av-data-for-bl.a.-artificiell-intelligens-och-digital-innovation">National Strategy for Data</a> aiming to increase the amount of data that can be used for the development of, for example, artificial intelligence (AI) by facilitating data sharing. The EU wants to lead the data-driven society and the government&#x2019;s ambition is to actively contribute to an internal market for data.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Standardisation Strategy</p><p>The <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/land--och-regionsstrategier/2018/07/regeringens-strategi-for-standardisering/">National Standardisation Strategy</a> <em>(Regeringens strategi f&#xf6;r standardisering)</em> was adopted in July 2018. The strategy identifies a number of Swedish strategic priorities from a national, European and international perspective, and describes how they should be addressed through an active Swedish standardisation policy.</p><p>In addition, sector-specific priorities are described. These priorities have been identified through a mapping activity and standardisation analysis of the government and other relevant authorities. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Interoperable Data Exchange</p><p>During the last years, the Swedish government has focused more on interoperability and standardisation, as demonstrated by the different government initiatives for standardised and interoperable information and data exchange. </p><p>More specifically, two government initiatives were launched in May 2018, focusing on establishing the foundation for a more standardised and interoperable national approach to base registries and information exchange. Several key stakeholders were involved in the initiatives, including some of the larger government agencies and the Agency for Digital Government (DIGG), which had the responsibility to coordinate work. </p><p>The final reports for the initiatives were submitted in 2019. In line with the proposals in the reports, two new government initiatives were started at the end of 2019 with a view to establishing a <a href="https://www.digg.se/om-oss/regeringsuppdrag/pagaende-regeringsuppdrag/nationellt-ramverk-for-grunddata/">national framework for basic data</a> in public administration and a <a href="https://www.digg.se/om-oss/regeringsuppdrag/pagaende-regeringsuppdrag/gemensam-informationsutbyte">digital infrastructure for information exchange</a>. A long-term plan to that end was defined in 2020 and the first deliverables based on this plan were available in 2021. The work continues in 2022.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Swedish Framework for Digital Collaboration</p><p>The <a href="https://www.digg.se/utveckling-av-digital-forvaltning/svenskt-ramverk-for-digital-samverkan">Swedish Framework for Digital Collaboration</a> (i.e. the Swedish version of the EIF) aims to help all public and publicly funded organisations to navigate in the same direction and thereby be able to exchange information effectively. It was developed by several government agencies in a collaboration programme called eSam and is now managed by the DIGG. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Standard Business Reporting</p><p>The Standard Business Reporting (SBR) is a methodology for digital exchange of structured business information whose basis consists of financial information. That way, the SBR, based on open standards to increase the availability of business data, creates business value through digitalised financial information.</p><p>In 2022, the possibility of setting up a regulatory sandbox will also be explored with the aim of testing new possibilities to increase automated and digitalised information exchange between companies and authorities.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Initiative for Increasing Individuals&#x2019; Insight of and Control over Personal Information </p><p>In 2020, the Swedish government initiated an <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/regeringsuppdrag/2020/09/uppdrag-att-mojliggora-losningar-for-individen-till-kontroll-och-insyn-av-data-om-individen/">assignment</a> aimed at increasing individuals&#x2019; insight of and possible control over information about them available within public administration organisations. This mission was assigned as joint effort to the <a href="https://arbetsformedlingen.se/">Swedish Employment Service</a>, the <a href="https://www.ehalsomyndigheten.se/other-languages/english/">Swedish eHealth Agency</a>, the <a href="https://www.digg.se/en">DIGG</a> and the <a href="https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish.4.12815e4f14a62bc048f4edc.html">Swedish Tax Agency</a>. It includes the development of a conceptual solution that can be implemented as a common digital infrastructure within public administrations, and which can be further developed to also connect with private actors&#x2019; digital infrastructure and services. The final report was delivered in June 2021. </p><p>The conceptual work has then continued within new government assignments, although not as a main focus but rather as an architectural component. Technical solutions are headed by the Swedish Employment Service. Furthermore, the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency received an identical assignment from the Norwegian government and representatives from the DIGG have continuous access to the advancements made after having been invited to participate in an advisory capacity.  </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Cross-border Digital Services Programme</p><p>The  is a strategic initiative that aims to accelerate the digital transformation in the Nordic-Baltic region. Overall, the goal is to increase mobility and integration in the region through seamless access to digital services across borders. The initiative will add value to citizens, businesses and public authorities. A representative from the DIGG and the Ministry of Infrastructure participates in the Programme Committee. More specifically, the programme has the following goals: </p><ul><li>Building secure and trusted electronic identification (eID) interoperability;</li><li>Promoting cross-border data exchange between authorities;</li><li>Enabling digital services across borders; and</li><li>Establishing an open funding mechanism (the CBDS Fund).</li></ul><p>Several projects are working on, e.g., developing the Nordic-Baltic eID (NOBID), enabling cross&#x2011;border digital services, including for studying abroad, and carrying out pilots in mapping and testing evidence exchange under the Single Digital Gateway Regulation. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eID for Employees</p><p>The possibility to use employee eIdentifications in external services outside of the employee&#x2019;s organisation has been introduced in form of an agreement on the business terms and technical requirements. One of the most important features is the possibility to use an organisation&#x2019;s specific identifier instead of the Swedish person identity number. This pseudonym decreases the risk of threats against employees. Other requirements and LoA (Level of Assurance) classification are the same. This means that the same trustframwork &#x201c;Tillitsramverket f&#xf6;r Svensk E-legitimation&#x201d; (Only minor differences compared with eIDAS implementing act 2015:1502) and framework for interoperability &#x201c;Technical Specifications for the Swedish eID Framework&#x201d; is used for both ordinary eID and eID for employees. Since this possibility was open recently, only a few actors have signed the contracts, but many more have shown interest to use it in the future.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>At the beginning of March 2019, seven government agencies with responsibilities in the field of cybersecurity also presented a <a href="https://rib.msb.se/filer/pdf/28898.pdf" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Comprehensive Cybersecurity Action Plan 2019&#x2011;2020</a><span resource="https://rib.msb.se/filer/pdf/28898.pdf" property="dct:title" content="Comprehensive Cybersecurity Action Plan 2019&#x2011;2020"/> to implement the strategy at the agency level. The action plan contained 77 of the most important measures that were scheduled to begin implementation in 2019. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), together with the same seven government agencies, will release updated versions of the action plan annually up to 2022. The updated versions contain new measures to be initiated as well as an evaluation of the measures introduced starting in 2019. The latest update of the <a href="https://www.msb.se/sv/publikationer/samlad-informations--och-cybersakerhetshandlingsplan-for-aren-20192022--redovisning-2020/" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Comprehensive Cybersecurity Action Plan</a><span resource="https://www.msb.se/sv/publikationer/samlad-informations--och-cybersakerhetshandlingsplan-for-aren-20192022--redovisning-2020/" property="dct:title" content="Comprehensive Cybersecurity Action Plan"/> was released and made publicly available on 2 March 2021.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">References to the Once-Only Principle</p><p>Two government initiatives were launched in May 2018, focussing on establishing the foundation for a more standardised and interoperable national approach to base registries and information exchange. Several key stakeholders were involved, including some of the larger government agencies and the DIGG, which had the responsibility to coordinate the work. </p><p>The final reports for these initiatives were submitted in 2019. As envisioned in the reports, two new government initiatives were launched at the end of the same year with the aim of establishing a basic data national framework in public administration and a common digital management infrastructure for information exchange, for which an <a href="https://www.digg.se/4905d9/globalassets/dokument/publicerat/publikationer/delredovisning_etablera_nationellt_ramverk_for_grunddata_20210129.pdf">interim report</a> was published in 2021. The two initiatives will be implemented in 2022.</p><p>Furthermore, a number of Swedish authorities, mainly the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the Swedish Tax Agency and the Stockholm University, participated in the European large-scale pilot projects Once-Only Principle (OOP) and Digital Europe For All (DE4A), both exploring the OOP prior to the introduction of the Single Digital Gateway Regulation.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Guidance from Central Government Authorities</p><p>The National Agency for Public Procurement provides guidance on eProcurement, eCommerce, the usage of dynamic purchasing systems and the sustainability analysis. The adopted method allows government agencies to focus their sustainability efforts on high impact categories. </p><p>The DIGG provides guidance on eProcurement and the use of the Peppol infrastructure and standards for post-award messages. The DIGG is the Swedish Peppol authority, leading the work on the national Peppol infrastructure and offering support primarily to service providers within Peppol but also to end users, like suppliers from the private sector and buyers in the public sector.</p><h2>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Vision for eHealth 2025</p><p>Digitisation offers great opportunities for the future of social services, health and medical care. Modern information and communication technologies (ICT) can make it easier for individuals to be involved in their own health and social care, support contact between individuals and service providers, and provide more efficient support systems for staff at service providers.</p><p>A<a href="https://ehalsa2025.se/visionen/"> strategy for eHealth for the period of 2020&#x2013;2022</a> has complemented the vision. The purpose of the strategy is to determine how the joint work of the government and SALAR should be designed and prioritised. The priorities identified are: (i) people awareness and involvement; (ii) safe and secure information; (iii) knowledge; (iv) digital transformation; and (v) collaboration. The government and SALAR will also work together on the legal framework and the consistent use of terminology and standards.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digitalisation of the Judiciary</p><p>Digitalisation can contribute to a judicial system which is well-functioning, efficient, based on rule of law and trusted by the people. Based on the <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/forordning--20191283-om-rattsvasendets_sfs-2019-1283">Ordinance (2019:1283) on the Digitalisation of the Judiciary</a>, authorities in the judicial system should accelerate the digital exchange of information and at the same time strengthen their digital government capability. In light of this, judicial authorities have been commissioned to jointly develop methods for managing criminal cases focusing on efficiency and to examine how to offer crime victims a better digital response.</p><p>In order to strengthen coordination, the government established a Council for the Digitalisation of the Judiciary, consisting of representatives from the law enforcement agencies. The Council held its first meeting in September 2020.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Declaration on AI in the Nordic-Baltic Region</p><ul><li>Improving opportunities for skills development with the goal of enabling more authorities, companies and organisations to use AI;</li><li>Enhancing access to data for AI to be used for better service to citizens and businesses in the region;</li><li>Developing ethical and transparent guidelines, standards, principles and values to guide when and how AI applications should be used;</li><li>Ensuring that infrastructure, hardware, software and data, all of which are central to the use of AI, are based on standards, enabling interoperability, privacy, security, trust, good usability and portability;</li><li>Ensuring that AI gets a prominent place in the European discussion and implementation of initiatives within the framework of the Digital Single Market;</li><li>Avoiding unnecessary regulation in the area, which is under rapid development; and</li><li>Utilising the structure of the Nordic Council of Ministers to facilitate the collaboration in relevant policy areas.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Assignment to Promote Public Administration&#x2019;s Ability to Use AI</p><p>In 2021, the Swedish government gave an assignment to the four government agencies that work with AI the most, the <a href="https://www.bolagsverket.se/">Swedish Companies Registration Office</a> (<em>Bolagsverket</em>), the <a href="https://arbetsformedlingen.se/">Swedish Employment Service</a> (<em>Arbetsf&#xf6;rmedlingen</em>), the <a href="https://www.digg.se/en">DIGG</a> and the <a href="https://www.skatteverket.se/servicelankar/otherlanguages/inenglish.4.12815e4f14a62bc048f4edc.html">Swedish Tax Agency</a> (<em>Skatteverket</em>). The expected result from the assignment is that the agencies should provide (i) a guide for public administration on how to use AI; (ii) a trust model for using automated processes and decisions with the support of AI; (iii) a project library for AI projects in public administration; and (iv) the start-up of a common AI infrastructure. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Approach to Artificial Intelligence</p><p>In November 2020, the Swedish eHealth Agency published its report<em> &#x2018;</em><a href="https://www.ehalsomyndigheten.se/globalassets/dokument/rapporter/fokusrapport_ai_och_e-halsa_20201124.pdf">Artificial Intelligence and eHealth</a>&#x2019; (<em>Artificiell intelligens och e-h&#xe4;lsa</em>).

It is based on transparency and understanding to ensure trust and confidence. The concept was tested at a function of the Land Registry but is generic and intended for use in the entire public sector. The findings of the report are now being used in the above&#x2011;mentioned assignment to promote public administration&#x2019;s ability to use AI (see Section 3.5.1).</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-658.jpeg" alt="A picture containing floor, indoor

Requests can be in any form and anonymous. This is known as the principle of public access to official records. Each agency is required to keep a register of all official documents and most indices should be publicly available. An effort is currently being made to make the registers available electronically. Decisions by public authorities to deny access to official documents may be appealed.

In other words, the SGSI has a wider function than that of being a national node to TESTA, as it is also used for secure communication between national users. The network is also expected to become increasingly important for national crisis communication among Swedish government agencies. </p><p>The SGSI is an IP service, a virtual private network which has no direct connection with the open internet. According to the security target in force, the SGSI is used by accredited government agencies. Accreditation implies that case sensitive information which has been classified according to the EU Council&#x2019;s security regulations as &#x2018;Restreint UE&#x2019; can be transferred to TESTA and to connected agencies. </p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Secure Data Communication </p><p>The infrastructure for secure digital communication is developed and operated by <a href="https://www.inera.se/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="inera ab" resource="https://www.inera.se/">Inera AB</a>, owned by <a href="https://skr.se/tjanster/englishpages.411.html" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="salar" resource="https://skr.se/tjanster/englishpages.411.html">SALAR</a>.

The new &#x2018;national identity card&#x2019; (<em>nationellt identitetskort</em>) is not compulsory and does not replace previous paper ID cards. It can be used as proof of identity and citizenship, and as a valid travel document within the Schengen area. The card complies with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards for biometric travel documents; it is issued by passport offices and manufactured by the same supplier as the biometric passport. In addition to the contactless chip containing a digital picture of the holder, it also has a traditional chip, which may be used to securely access eGovernment services in the future. </p><p>Based on Regulation (EU) 2019/1157 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the security requirements for identity cards of Union citizens and residence documents include, e.g., fingerprint information.</p><p>Despite the fact that it can be read electronically, the card is not an eID that can be used in order to authenticate the user remotely. A study proposed to complement it with an eID according to eIDAS Level of Assurance High, but no decision has been made yet.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Non-Official eID Cards and Software-based eIDs (eLegitimation)</p><p>The personal identity number is used as the identifier when the eID is used for an eService, while legal entities can have an organisational number as identifier. The same number can be used in certificates for authentication and signing. The certificates contain the name of the organisation and the organisational number, and may also include a URL. The contact person ordering organisational certificates must have an authorisation for this purpose from a person authorised to sign on behalf of his/her organisation. </p><p>Most actors in the public sector base their eServices on the SAML 2.0 standard, even though old eID schemes do not follow this standard. For this reason, most eServices rely on proxy identity providers (IdPs). This system has worked well but deviations from the standard in the implementation of proxy IdPs have become an obstacle for implementing cross-border authentications and for new suppliers that fulfil the standard.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eIDAS</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Biometric Passports</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eProcurement Virtual System</p><p>The central eProcurement authorities&#x2019; role consists in monitoring the supplied services and compliance with standards.
