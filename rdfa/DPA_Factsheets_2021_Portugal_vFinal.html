It follows a citizen-driven approach and has a strong focus on co-creation, with the ultimate goal of simplifying as much as possible citizens and businesses&#x2019; everyday life as well as their interaction with the public administration. SIMPLEX pursues in one single governmental programme the objectives of better regulation, administrative burden reduction, service interoperability, digitisation, red tape cutting and digital government promotion.</p><p>The responsibility for the programme lies with the Minister for State Modernisation and Public Administration, directly supported by the Prime Minister. The Secretary of State for Innovation and Administrative Modernisation is in charge of coordinating and monitoring the programme, with the technical support of the Administrative Modernisation Agency. Furthermore, SIMPLEX includes a Focal Point Network, consisting of representatives of the various Ministries.</p><p>The programme is highly inclusive and innovative, involving citizens, entrepreneurs and public servants in determining and designing the initiatives to be implemented by the public administration. Participants are offered channels for their involvement through the organisation of nationwide meetings and design brainstorming sessions, &#x2018;Start-up SIMPLEX&#x2019; competitions and the SIMPLEX website.</p><p>Overall, SIMPLEX has already launched over 1&#xa0;600 simplification measures. </p><p>SIMPLEX has proven to be a successful and replicable model, with an average annual execution rate exceeding 88.59% (2016-2019) and a very positive feedback from the programme&#x2019;s stakeholders. In 2019, an Ernst &amp; Young evaluation, commissioned by the European Commission in coordination with the Portuguese government, analysed the impact of 40 measures of SIMPLEX 2016 and 2017, concluding that they represented a yearly net saving of EUR 170.1 million and 15 million working hours, plus a potential additional benefit for the economy corresponding to EUR 89 million. The effectiveness of the SIMPLEX methodology has been further recognised by the European Institute of Public Administration, which awarded SIMPLEX the <a href="https://epsa2019.eu/en/news/show/&amp;tid=182">European Public Service Award 2019</a> in the European and national category.</p><p>Simplex 2020/2021 &#x2013; Part of our lives</p><p>The <a href="https://www.simplex.gov.pt/">2020/2021</a> edition is organized around two main blocks, &#x2018;Better Public Service&#x2019; and &#x2018;Modern and Innovative Public Administration&#x2019;, including a total of 158 measures.</p><p>A standout measure of this edition is &#x2018;My Data&#x2019;, which will allow citizens to know when and why the public sector interchanges personal information relating to them. This initiative will also ensure that citizens are able to accept these transactions and know what information the public sector has about them.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic implied significant transformations in public administration, namely: (i) increased delivery of digital public services; (ii) accelerated collaborative processes; (iii) increased number of innovative practices; and (iv) massive adoption of remote work. Facing these transformations was only possible as a result of the investment in administrative modernisation and the cultural transformation of the public administration under the SIMPLEX Programme, allowing to identify 195 initiatives to promptly respond to the pandemic.</p><p>This initiative is structured around five main axes: inclusion, education, qualification, specialisation and research. It includes a variety of measures to be implemented by different governmental bodies in collaboration with the private sector, academia and civil society. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategy for Innovation and Modernisation in the State and Public Administration</p><p>The <a href="https://www.apin.gov.pt/">Strategy for Innovation and Modernisation in the State and Public Administration 2020-23</a>, promoted by the area of government responsible for State modernisation and public administration, was developed through a participatory process that involved public servants, the academia and the private sector.</p><p>The strategy was approved by the <a href="https://dre.pt/home/-/dre/139209032/details/maximized">Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 55/2020</a> and presented in July 2020 as a roadmap for modernising the State and the public administration, with 14 strategic objectives distributed among four transformative axes:</p><ul><li>Investing in People, aiming to attract and mobilize public officials, including through renewed and dynamic leadership models;</li><li>Developing Management, aiming to strategically manage employees and leverage performance through business models focused on value creation;</li><li>Exploring Technology, aiming to provide citizens and businesses with secure, accessible, integrated and seamless services; and</li><li>Strengthening Proximity, aiming to bring decision-making and public action closer to citizens.</li></ul><p>These objectives are achieved through cross-cutting and sectoral measures, uniting government in a common purpose: developing a permanent transformative capacity in public administration to respond promptly to and anticipate the challenges it must address.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Action Plan for the <a href="https://dre.pt/web/guest/home/-/dre/132133788/details/maximized" target="_blank">Digital Transition</a> </p><p>The action plan consists of 12 flagship initiatives in total.

The primary goal has been evolving since the 1<sup>st </sup>edition and in the latest one was to quickly produce support materials for the public sector teams that due to the pandemic were working in new environments. Since April 2020, 45 projects have been produced, focusing on tools for remote working, daily organisation, leadership and digital public services design.

It is free and open to all users that want to access data, but also to citizens and organisations that wish to make data of public interest available. All they need to do is to register, receive their application programming interface (API) key and characterise the dataset they wish to upload. Each dataset can have more than one associated resource and can be published in different and multiple formats, which is one of the features enabling data reuse. It is also possible to index datasets by introducing an URL referring to the origin of the data, which is ideal for entities that already have the information available in their own platforms, like the partilha.justi&#xe7;a.gov.pt from the Ministry of Justice or the <em>Lisboa Aberta</em> portal from the Lisbon City Hall.

Among the initiatives developed in this context, the following stand out: </p><ul><li>The Network of Innovators is a community of practices, with 675 members, aiming to promote collaborative work sessions among public administration workers to share knowledge and experiences resulting from projects and/or experimental approaches. The network has at its disposal two instruments to promote its dynamisation: (i) LabXpresso, a bimonthly newsletter where projects, case studies and tools applied by the LabX team are presented; and (ii) WORKSHOP@LabX, face-to-face or virtual sessions that take place in an informal environment and can have different formats, where participants can identify challenges and opportunities for innovation within the public administration;</li><li>The Network of Experimentation Labs is an initiative in which public administration teams are given project-based training to apply in rapid prototyping cycles. They use LabX&#x2019;s approach to materialise experimental projects (with a duration of up to six months), which allows these teams to accelerate transformational proposals, for both public service delivery and public sector organisations. The Network of Experimentation Labs allows to develop a &#x2018;belt of multipliers&#x2019; which will promote and scale innovation within the public administration.</li><li>At the moment, LabX has been working with four teams of public entities of local government (three municipalities and a central organisation) through established partnerships based on protocols. </li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Collaborative Work Plan Network</p><p>The Collaborative Work Plan is a framework for collaborative projects emerging organically from public leaders, aiming to tackle difficult challenges and deliver results through combined efforts and resources from several organisations, including from universities and not-for-profit organisations. The network is growing, delivering three collaborative work plans in a year, and expanding the &#x2018;Commitment to collaborate&#x2019; signed by the involved leaders.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Citizen Shops</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ama.gov.pt/web/english/citizen-shop" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="citizen shops" resource="https://www.ama.gov.pt/web/english/citizen-shop">Citizen Shops</a> are a concept of public service delivery that combines in the same physical space several public and private entities. It does so with the aim of expediting relations between citizens, companies and the public administration.</p><p>The establishment of the first Citizen Shops took place in 1999 in Lisbon and Oporto. Their opening was the first step in the direction of the one-stop-shop concept for public service delivery, since citizens now have access to a wide range of public and private services in the same place. </p><p>This model has been continuously developed to respond to the evolving needs of citizens and companies. Examples include the availability of free Wi-Fi and the possibility to automatically assess, through QR code or free SMS, the services provided in the shops. </p><p>As of 9 March 2021, the network of Citizen Shops comprises 59 one-stop-shops.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Citizen Spots </p><p>The <a href="https://www.ama.gov.pt/web/english/citizen-spot" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="citizen spot" resource="https://www.ama.gov.pt/web/english/citizen-spot">Citizen Spot</a> is a multiservice physical counter where a specialised mediator assists citizens in accessing a portfolio of digital public services and further teaches them how to operate autonomously thereafter.</p><p>The services provided are essentially those already available on various websites, but some citizens may not feel capable or comfortable to use them by themselves. They include civil registration documents, forms to request the European Health Insurance Card, the Tax Authority&#x2019;s land registry, social security and tax services, just to name a few.</p><p>All spots are equipped with a double-screen system (one screen for the mediator and one for the citizen) that allows citizens to follow the steps being taken by the mediator. The service is provided in a completely transparent way, allowing the citizen to learn and control all the steps and procedures done by the assistant and hence reducing the chances for abuse of power/corruption to virtually zero. </p><p>Moreover, all the operations are supported by the electronic identification tools developed by AMA, namely the PIN-protected Citizen Card and the Digital Mobile Key, thus strengthening the citizens&#x2019; trust in digital services and helping them understand the emphasis put on rights to privacy, data and consumer protection.</p><p>The combination of public digital services with the onsite assistance of a specialised mediator, in a brand-new hybrid model of service delivery, has proven to be an effective way to engage citizens in the use of digital services. It makes everyone more aware of the available services and their respective benefits, and also of online security, which is fundamental to boost public confidence in the use of ICTs in general. </p><p>As of 9 March 2021, there were 742 spots located in town halls, parishes or public libraries throughout the country (aiming to be close to citizens of all backgrounds) and also in the cities of S&#xe3;o Paulo (Brazil), Paris (France), Brussels (Belgium) and London (UK), providing more than 230 services with nearly 7 million attendances. </p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Interoperability Platform of the Public Administration</p><p>The <a href="http://www.iap.gov.pt/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="interoperability platform of the public administration (iap) " resource="http://www.iap.gov.pt/">Interoperability Platform of the Public Administration (iAP) </a>is a services-oriented central platform that aims to make available to all public administrations a shared tool that allows multichannel services for citizens and enterprises.

It is a form of secure online citizens&#x2019; authentication and signature, based on a system similar to home banking solutions, through the introduction of a username (citizen&#x2019;s mobile number), password (chosen by the citizen) and a one-time password sent by SMS, e-mail or Twitter account (also chosen by the citizen). Since December 2017, citizens can also use a Digital Mobile Key app for receiving the one-time password associated with each authentication through push notifications on their smartphones. More recently, in April 2018, the Digital Mobile Key was upgraded with a remote qualified signature feature, according to the eIDAS Regulation.</p><p>The main objective is offering a complementary authentication solution through mobile devices, safer than the access via username and password (ensuring more security to the State) and simpler to the citizen (ensuring more effectiveness and efficiency to citizens and companies).

Social Security is adopting this new concept to accelerate the internal services in the network edge and support the homeworking of large numbers of remote users adopting Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) technology to assure secure access to the services and applications with the best experience and security.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Social Security - Process Automation and Mining </p><p>Social Security adopted the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology and implemented automation of several business processes, including European pensions forms E250/P5000 and special needs education forms. At present, it is starting to evaluate other business process candidates to automation using process mining. The use of these technologies intends to significantly reduce the process execution time, cut to zero the backlog and free human resources to execute other processes. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Social Security &#x2013; Chatbot  </p><p>Social Security adopted a chatbot solution in response to the COVID-19 crisis to support automated response to the citizen&#x2019;s main questions. At present, the second phase is being started through the implementation of contextual integration with the Social Security Portal and AI features to automate more responses. A live chat with human Contact Centre agents is also planned.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Social Security &#x2013; Big Data Platforms for Monitoring</p><p>The Social Security Informatics Institute builds in-house infrastructure monitoring solutions using big data tools and methodologies. </p><p>The technological stack consists of a large number of mostly open-source components (e.g. HDFS, YARN, ZooKeeper, Kafka, Kudu and Fluent), as well as a few proprietary ones, mainly for administration and data visualisation. The main component is a Cloudera Cluster running on Linux over commodity hardware.</p><p>This toolset allows the development of efficient pipelines for the ingestion, processing and sharing of large volumes of very heterogeneous data within a short time to market. The ingested data consists mostly of application and system logs, data obtained by querying business databases and instrumentation tools, along with a few more unusual sources. The result is near real-time update of a few hundred system indicators (and some business performance ones).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Social Security &#x2013; Data Quality and Business Intelligence</p><p>The big data platform adopted for infrastructure monitoring, with a few additional software components (e.g. Sqoop and Spark job), is also the foundation on which some business intelligence jobs build. These business intelligence jobs are oriented to data quality (consolidation of data with more than a single source of truth) and fraud detection. </p><p>This toolset allows Social Security to deliver, in a matter of minutes or hours, information and insights that might take days to calculate using more traditional tools. Without this toolset, the output of these jobs would be, in most cases, outdated at birth.</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-656.jpeg" alt="35-656.jpeg" class="keepElement"/></p><p>	Cross-border </p><p>Digital Public Administration Services </p><p>7</p><p>	</p><h1>Cross-border Digital Public Administration Services for Citizens and Businesses</h1><p>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to &#x2018;life and travel&#x2019;, as well as &#x2018;doing business&#x2019; abroad.
