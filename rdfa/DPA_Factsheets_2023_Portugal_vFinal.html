It establishes three strategic objectives for 2019-2023:</p><ul><li>Maximising resilience, i.e. overcoming the threats that could compromise cyberspace of national interest&#x2019;s security;</li><li>Promoting innovation, i.e. affirming the cyberspace as a domain for the economic, social and cultural development and prosperity; and</li><li>Generating and ensuring resources, i.e. contributing to achieving adequate resources to guarantee the country&#x2019;s cyberspace security capacity. </li></ul><p>In the context of the objectives established by the National Strategy for Cyberspace Security 2019-2023, the National Cybersecurity Centre (CNCS) created the Public Administration Cybersecurity Forum, which aims to identify and disseminate cybersecurity best practices within public administration and to foster information sharing at management and policy levels.</p><p>It is also worth mentioning that, in August 2019, Portugal became a participating State in the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE), recognising said threats as a cross-cutting priority that requires a cooperative approach within the EU and NATO, and in line with the objective of creating a national plan to counter disinformation and cyberattacks.</p><p>Also worth mentioning in this context is the <a href="https://www.c-hub.pt/">Cybersecurity Digital Innovation Hub</a> (C-Hub), recognised as a national DIH in June 2021 and also part of the European Digital Innovation Hubs Network. It is coordinated by the CNCS and aggregates different stakeholders from the public sector, R&amp;D and the private sector. The purpose of the C-Hub is to implement digital transformation processes, focusing in particular on cybersecurity, providing innovative services, advice and planning to both public and private entities (in particular SMEs). This DIH is funded by the national RRF.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Cybersecurity Framework</p><p>In 2019, the National Cybersecurity Centre (CNCS) published the <a href="https://www.cncs.gov.pt/en/quadro-nacional/">National Cybersecurity Framework</a> to allow organisations to reduce the risk associated with cyber threats, providing the basis for any entity to meet the minimum security requirements of networks and information systems. In 2022 the CNCS developed a <a href="https://www.cncs.gov.pt/pt/certificacao-nacional/">national certification scheme of compliance with the National Cybersecurity Framework</a> which will enable public and private organisations to certify the implementation of their organisational, procedural, technological and human cybersecurity practices. This certification scheme can streamline public administration while strengthening the levels of cybersecurity as envisaged by the Strategy for Innovation and Modernisation in the State and Public Administration 2020&#x2013;23.</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-587.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

It does so with the aim of expediting relations between citizens, companies and the public administration.</p><p>The establishment of the first Citizen Shops took place in 1999 in Lisbon and Oporto. Their opening was the first step in the direction of the one-stop-shop concept for public service delivery since citizens now have access to a wide range of public and private services in the same place. </p><p>This model has been continuously developed to respond to the evolving needs of citizens and companies.

Since December 2017, citizens can also use a Digital Mobile Key app for receiving the one-time password associated with each authentication through push notifications on their smartphones. More recently, in April 2018, the Digital Mobile Key was upgraded with a remote qualified signature feature, according to the eIDAS Regulation.</p><p>The main objective is to offer a complementary authentication solution through mobile devices, safer than access via username and password (ensuring more security to the State) and simpler for the citizen (ensuring more effectiveness and efficiency for citizens and companies).

This functionality involves a dialogue structure developed through an AI tool. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Participa.gov </p><p><a href="https://participa.gov.pt/base/home" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="participa.gov" resource="https://participa.gov.pt/base/home">Participa.gov</a> is a centralised platform aimed at supporting public administrations&#x2019; participatory processes (e.g. participatory budgets) making use of blockchain technology for attributing votes to citizens in a transparent, secure and anonymous way.</p><p>Participa.gov uses the national eID scheme to guarantee authenticity and citizens&#x2019; security in participatory processes. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big Data</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Social Security &#x2013; Big Data Platforms for Monitoring</p><p>The Social Security Informatics Institute builds in-house infrastructure monitoring solutions using big data tools and methodologies. </p><p>The technological stack consists of a large number of mostly open-source components (e.g. HDFS, YARN, ZooKeeper, Kafka, Kudu and Fluent), as well as a few proprietary ones, mainly for administration and data visualisation. The main component is a Cloudera Cluster running on Linux over commodity hardware.</p><p>This toolset allows for the development of efficient pipelines for the ingestion, processing and sharing of large volumes of very heterogeneous data within a short time to market. The ingested data consist mostly of application and system logs, data obtained by querying business databases and instrumentation tools, along with a few more unusual sources. The result is a near real-time update of a few hundred system indicators (and some business performance ones).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Social Security &#x2013; Data Quality and Business Intelligence</p><p>The big data platform adopted for infrastructure monitoring, with a few additional software components (e.g. Sqoop and Spark job), is also the foundation on which some business intelligence jobs are built. These business intelligence jobs are oriented to data quality (consolidation of data with more than a single source of truth) and fraud detection.</p><p>This toolset allows Social Security to deliver, in a matter of minutes or hours, information and insights that might take days to calculate using more traditional tools. Without this toolset, the output of these jobs would be, in most cases, outdated at birth.</p><p>Platform of Indicators, Statistics and Open Data of Justice</p><p>The project aims to develop a platform of indicators, official statistics and open data that enables the collection and processing of justice data (Big Data), integrating data sources from judiciary services and other public and private entities, whenever possible with the creation of communication services with the source information systems, promoting interoperability with initiatives from civil society and the business sector. </p><p>The purpose is to expand the information services and products, boosting knowledge, mobilising professionals, the scientific community and society for informed evaluation and debate, in order to define measures and policies suitable for the improvement of justice.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud Computing </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.  </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.  </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance Computing</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Social Security - Service Edge</p><p>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed to improve response times and save bandwidth. Social Security is adopting this new concept to accelerate the internal services in the network edge and support working from home for a large number of remote users who adopt Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) technology to get secure access to the services and applications with the best user experience and highest security.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Gigabit Network</p><p>In order to ensure coverage of all households, in the national territory, with a Gigabit network by 2030, the government mandated the National Communications Authority (ANACOM) to:</p><ul><li>Collect up-to-date information on the coverage of very high capacity networks (VHCN), including information on plans of any undertaking to roll out broadband networks, including VHCN;</li><li>Designate the geographical areas without VHCN (&#x201c;white areas&#x201d;) based on the information collected; and</li><li>Prepare the proposals for the specifications of the tendering procedures to be carried out by the government for the installation, operation and maintenance of Gigabit networks in the identified areas.</li></ul><p>In what concerns the provision of mobile services, including broadband services to achieve Gigabit connectivity, the 5G auction regulation established coverage and network development obligations thus creating an environment that fosters the development of population&apos;s digital skills, economic growth, social inclusion, and the competitiveness of the country and all of its regions. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">GovTech</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Other Innovative Technologies </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Social Security - Process Automation and Mining </p><p>Social Security adopted the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology and implemented automation of several business processes, including European pensions forms E250/P5000 and special needs education forms. At present, it is starting to evaluate, by means of process mining, other business processes which could be automated. The use of these technologies aims to significantly reduce the process execution time, eliminate the backlog and free human resources to execute other processes.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Caixa Geral de Aposenta&#xe7;&#xf5;es - Process Automation </p><p>Caixa Geral de Aposenta&#xe7;&#xf5;es, I.P., uses Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology to update scheme member personal data, namely to perform the re-enrolment of teachers, and to prevent external fraud, through automatic detection of illicit instances of pension and salary overlapping.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Caixa Geral de Aposenta&#xe7;&#xf5;es - Digital Proof of Life </p><p>The electronic life proof for pensioners living abroad, which compares the biometric data of the image taken from the identification document and a real time video of the pensioner and replaces, in a much more convenient way, consular services.</p><p>Social Security - Video Attendance</p><p>Video Attendance is an innovative form of assistance that allows citizens to access social security services, regardless of their geographic location, residence status in the country or abroad, or mobility status. Having the characteristics of a personalised service, it guarantees the response to the same products made available in the face-to-face channel, including the delivery of documents and, additionally, makes it possible to accompany the customer in carrying out a service available online, promoting the use of Direct Social Security services. Videoconference assistance proved to be an efficient management factor of the service network resources, maximising and optimising it immediately and without allocation of resources and additional costs. This project won the Best Government Project Award at the 6<sup>th</sup> Edition of the Portugal Digital Awards in 2021.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Quantum Communication </p><p>The National Security Office (GNS) is involved in a Euro QCI project through the PTQCI Digital Europe Programme, which aims to establish the national initial instance of an ultra-secure quantum communications technology infrastructure, which will be a component of the larger Euro QCI project. While delivering the initial segments of such a network, this project will evolve, covering not only other areas of the country (namely Azores and Madeira through satellite links), but also cross-border connections, thus enlarging the European Union network based on this type of technology. The consortium that has been created to put this project forward is composed of several entities from industry, academia, and governmental agencies.</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-707.png" alt="32-707.png" class="keepElement"/></p><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p></div><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/publicservice/Portugal" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on Portugal&#x2019;s responsible bodies for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-portugal">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2>National</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Secretary of State for Digitalisation and Administrative Modernisation</p><p>The <a href="https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc23/primeiro-ministro/secretarios-de-estado?i=digitalizacooedamodernizacooadministrativa">Secretary of State for Digitalisation and Administrative Modernization</a> is responsible for the modernisation of public administration and digital government, under the direct tutelage and guidance of the Prime Minister.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Administrative Modernisation Agency</p><p>Created in 2007, the <a href="http://www.ama.pt/">Administrative Modernisation Agency (AMA) </a>is the public institute in charge of digital government and administrative modernisation and simplification, under the superintendence and tutelage of the Secretary of State for Digitalisation and Administrative Modernisation.
