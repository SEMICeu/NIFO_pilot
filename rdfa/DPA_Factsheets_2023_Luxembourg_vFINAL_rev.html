The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Luxembourg in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Luxembourg related to Scoreboard 1 show an overall very good implementation of the EIF Principles. Luxembourg has a higher performance in the implementation of Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and Principle 9 (Multilingualism) in comparison with the EU average. Implementing the recommendations of principle 12 will result in the score rising from 3 to 4 in 2022, which is now above the EU average. The areas of improvement of Luxembourg with regard to Scoreboard 1 are located in Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility). In particular, to ensure that all European public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups would allow the country to reach a maximum score of 4 in Principle 7.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Luxembourg&#x2019;s results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 highlight an overall good performance. Luxembourg obtains maximum scores of 4 in all the interoperability layers. In 2022, the performance of the implementation of the legal interoperability recommendations has enabled the layer to go from 2 to 4. The performance could be improved by focusing on perceiving data and information as a public asset that should be appropriately generated, collected, managed, shared, protected and preserved. (Recommendation 30). However, the recommendation has no impact on the score for the &quot;semantic interoperability&quot; layer, which has a score of 4.

The Ministry also announced that the objectives and the initiatives defined under each axis can only be achieved by applying a collaborative approach to innovation in general and by facilitating technological innovation. The Ministry&#x2019;s strategic axes are the following:</p><ul><li>1. Developing eGovernment;</li><li>2. Advancing the administrative reform;</li><li>3. Promoting digital inclusion; and</li><li>4. Integrating new technologies.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eGovernance Strategy 2021&#x2013;2025</p><p>In February 2021, the Government Council adopted the <a href="https://ctie.gouvernement.lu/fr/publications/2021/strategie-gouvernance-electronique-2021-2025.html">eGovernance Strategy</a> for 2021&#x2013;2025, jointly developed by the Ministry for Digitalisation and the Government IT Centre (<em>Centre des technologies de l&apos;information de l&apos;&#xc9;tat</em>, CTIE). The Governing Council also mandated the Inter&#x2011;ministerial Committee for Digitalisation to coordinate the implementation of this strategy.</p><p>One of the strategic axes of the Ministry for Digitalisation aims to strengthen eGovernment and enable the transition to a digital government, a concept which designates the use of technologies within the framework of State modernisation strategies with the objective of creating real added value for citizens, businesses and public administrations. The eGovernance Strategy forms part of this approach by setting the essential elements for a successful digital transition of the State to ensure quality digital services and to guarantee a gradual transition to a digital government, as recommended by international organisations. The 2021&#x2013;2025 strategy highlights the principles to be respected when digitising public services to offer citizens and businesses public services that meet their needs. The goal is promoting transversal digital accessibility, developing user-centred services, offering attractive online public services and investing in citizens&#x2019; trust in online State services.</p><p>Furthermore, the strategy analyses the essential conditions for the central public administration so as to enable it to respond effectively to the needs of society. The overarching objectives in the digital context are to facilitate the transition to an efficient paperless administration and to have an information technology (IT) environment conducive to new ways of working. </p><p>Finally, the strategy underlines the importance of being able to rely on a central IT partner who is competent, agile and reliable. To this aim, the CTIE aims to strengthen its digitalisation services, develop cutting-edge infrastructures and further guarantee very high levels of security and reliability.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-960.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>Einfach L&#xeb;tzebuerg</p><p>The government has been committed to administrative reform and simplification for several years now and much progress has already been made, notably under the programme <a href="https://fonction-publique.public.lu/fr/plus/actualites/articles-actualites/2017/04/20170403_Einfach-Letzebuerg.html"><em>Einfach L&#xeb;tzebuerg</em></a>. However, the simplification of administrative formalities and procedures is continually evolving. </p><p>Drawing on technological advances in particular, the programme aims to provide a simple and predictable framework for citizens and companies in their relations with the State. Any new project, legislation, procedure or adaptation of existing ones, when deemed necessary, needs to be respectively considered or reconsidered in light of the &#x2018;digital&#x2019; component.</p><p>The digitalisation and simplification of State administrations must proceed in parallel to reach the desired outcome, and all Ministries and administrations have concrete digitalisation projects on their agenda. Therefore, efforts needs to be consolidated and amalgamated to provide Luxembourg with an exemplary administration that will contribute to its economic attractiveness. In this framework, in February 2022 the Ministry for Digitalisation launched the <a href="https://www.zesumme-vereinfachen.lu/en-GB/">Zesumme Vereinfachen</a> platform. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Luxembourg</p><p>IT has become both a vital sector of the economy and an important influence factor in all socio&#x2011;economic sectors, which makes it an essential component of the government&#x2019;s policy of rationalisation, efficiency, modernisation and &#x2018;doing more with less&#x2019;. </p><p>In this context, in October 2014 the government decided to reinforce and consolidate Luxembourg&#x2019;s position as an IT and high-tech centre of excellence, and as an open and connected society, starting with a coherent and generalised strategic framework. <a href="https://digital-luxembourg.public.lu/">Digital Luxembourg</a> enables and supports new and existing projects that address the country&#x2019;s needs and fuel positive transformation. It establishes solid financial foundations for innovation, provides for the teaching and training of new competences, and helps to create new markets (big data, smart grids, health IT, financial technology, virtual currencies, etc.) for Luxembourg&#x2019;s rapidly growing IT sector. Digital Luxembourg strives to make them successful by facilitating public partnerships, securing funding and boosting visibility. </p><p>To maximise its impact, the strategy is applied horizontally throughout the different sectors and is a key component of every political decision. It is implemented by various Ministries for the domains that fall under their responsibility and is coordinated by the Department of Media, Connectivity and Digital Policy (SMC). The strategy is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, which is part of Luxembourg general political goals. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>On 8 December 2020, the Minister Delegate for Digitalisation signed the <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites.gouvernement+fr+actualites+toutes_actualites+communiques+2020+12-decembre+08-berlin-hansen.html">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>.

It defines principles, objectives, governance and recommendations in the field of interoperability, and gives specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services. More specifically, this framework, based on the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2c2f2554-0faf-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1.0017.02/DOC_3&amp;format=PDF">European Interoperability Framework (EIF)</a>, offers public administrations concrete recommendations on how to improve interoperability in the field of digital government and information and communication technology (ICT) in a sustainable and systematic way.</p><p>In 2019, the Ministry for Digitalisation set up a working group which in 2020 established an effective governance model for the NIF. In the framework of the NIF governance defined in 2020, the Sectorial Committee for Interoperability (CSI) of the central government was established, which had its first meeting in April 2021. The action plan of the CSI of the central government, as well as the catalogues of interoperability (IOP) of the National Committee for Interoperability (CNI) were updated in July 2022.</p><p>As part of the NIF, in April 2022 the Ministry for Digitalisation launched the &#x2018;NIF4Gov&#x2019; call for projects. NIF4Gov aims to support interoperability at the national level by setting up a framework to advice on projects selected by a jury and financed by the Ministry.</p><h2>Key Enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-961.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>Draft Law on the Electronic Signature of Administrative Documents and Secure Platform for Public Documents</p><p>To facilitate and accelerate the transmission of administrative documents between the government and the various State administrations and services, as well as between the State services and citizens, it is proposed to introduce the possibility of affixing the electronic signature and the electronic seal in administrative matters. The amended Law of 14 August 2000 on Electronic Commerce already provides for the option of using an electronic signature for private documents. Similarly, the Draft Law on the Electronic Signature of Administrative Documents provides for the possibility of affixing electronic signatures or seals to administrative documents issued by administrative authorities and to transmit them electronically. </p><p>Through its various provisions, the draft law, together with the Secure Platform for Public Documents, will contribute to the digitalisation of the public administration, by facilitating the conclusion of administrative acts in digital format. Many internal procedures and procedures based on a signed act can thus be digitised. The draft law and the platform are expected to be adopted before the autumn of 2023.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-965.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>Electronic Signature Verification and Validation Platform</p><p>With the aforementioned Draft Law on the Electronic Signature of Administrative Documents and Secure Platform for Public Documents, providing for the possibility to use qualified electronic signature in administrative matters, the needs in terms of verification of electronic signatures will increase. The Electronic Signature Verification and Validation Platform will address those needs. This new platform aims to allow State agents to verify and validate electronic signatures of all European countries in accordance with the requirements of the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation). The user uploads the document to the platform, which validates the electronic signatures, stamps and timestamps present on the document on the basis of the European trusted lists. The platform then presents the results of the validation in a simplified way. It further allows to download a detailed report and print the validation summary in a print-friendly format. After the validation report is issued, the document is destroyed automatically on the platform.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security Aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Fourth National Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>On 24 February 2021, the government approved the <a href="https://infocrise.public.lu/fr/cyber/informations-generales/strategie-nationale-cybersecurite.html">fourth National Cybersecurity Strategy</a>, building on the foundations of the previous strategies and illustrating the government&#x2019;s engagement to meet the security challenges related to the digital transformation. The strategy focuses on three key objectives, each containing a series of strategic priorities:</p><ul><li>Objective I: building confidence in the digital world and protecting human rights online;</li><li>Objective II: strengthening the security and resilience of digital infrastructures in Luxembourg; and</li><li>Objective III: developing a reliable, sustainable and secure digital economy.</li></ul><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of Base Registries</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-966.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>REG4GOV Project</p><p>In 2022, the jury of the NIF4Gov call for projects selected a project supported by the Ministry of Mobility and Public Works called &#x2018;REG4GOV&#x2019;. REG4GOV aims to define, through the design and deployment of the methodological fragments and technologies needed, a systematic and standardised approach to develop and set up basic registries in accordance with regulatory requirements. This project will thus make it possible, in particular, to make significant progress in terms of the Once-Only principle. Moreover, it is highly complementary to the work in progress on the Service Data Intermediation (SDI) and to the eGovernance Strategy 2021&#x2013;2025, which considers base registries as a key enabler towards a fully digital administration. The CTIE strongly relies on this strategy when implementing new back offices for administrations by interconnecting them with base registries (see above with regard to the reuse of data in the CTIE&#x2019;s infrastructure).</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital4Education Strategy </p><p>On 20 May 2015, the Minister for Education, Children and Youth presented the digital strategy for education called <a href="https://www.education.lu/">&#x2018;Digital4Education&#x2019;</a>. This strategy had two key objectives: </p><ul><li>Preparing young people for work in a complex and constantly changing environment (under the &#x2018;digital for education&#x2019; umbrella); and</li><li>Promoting new learning strategies, software and innovating educational projects (under the &#x2018;digital for education&#x2019; umbrella).</li></ul><p>Other projects under the Digital (4) Education Strategy include: (i) training teaching staff and offering access to digital teaching resources as part of eduSphere; (ii) introducing a maths-teaching software (for cycle 4) to be used at home and at school as part of <a href="http://www.mathematic.lu/">MathemaTIC</a>; and (iii) providing comprehensive computer literacy training and enabling students to better manage their lives through digital tools in the framework of <a href="http://portal.education.lu/dcl">Digital Classroom <em>L&#xeb;tzebuerg</em></a>. Further projects include FutureHub labels for schools committed to new technologies and an online teaching/learning platform.</p><p>In January 2020, the Minister for Education, Children and Youth also introduced coding in all mathematics classes throughout cycle 4 and 5 of the basic educational programme. The development of digital skills, particularly coding and computational thinking, is now seen as a fundamental precondition for schools wishing to effectively prepare young people for the careers of tomorrow, which will continuously require more and more digital skills. Thus, digital, computational and coding skills will systematically be taught throughout the primary and secondary education programmes in public schools. As part of the Code Week 2020, the Ministry for Education organised coding workshops with high schools and primary schools. In that context, a &#x2018;matchmaker&#x2019; platform was setup with the contribution of Digital Luxembourg, allowing teachers who want to organise coding workshops and need experienced assistance to register for an appointment with IT volunteers. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Einfach Digital</p><p>In February 2020, the government presented <a href="https://men.public.lu/fr/publications/dossiers-presse/2019-2020/einfach-digital.html">Einfach Digital</a>, a new approach to digitalisation in the classroom focused on critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration and coding. Einfach Digital represents the next generation in the Ministry for Education&#x2019;s digitalisation approach, thus replacing the Digital4Education strategy. The objective is to allow all Luxembourg&#x2019;s children and young adults to learn how computers work. The measures taken are part of the Media Compass (<em>Medienkompass</em>), a reference framework issued by the Ministry in March 2020 which provides guidelines to schoolteachers. Within the framework of the Einfach Digital initiative, a campaign on media use addressed to parents has also been launched. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-967.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>National Action Plan for Digital Inclusion</p><p>One of the main strategic axes of the Ministry for Digitalisation is the promotion of digital inclusion, a process which aims to make digital technology accessible to each individual, to give every individual the same opportunities to participate in the digital society and to counteract the digital divide. In this field, the <a href="https://digital-luxembourg.public.lu/initiatives/digital-inclusion">National Policy on eParticipation and/or Inclusion</a> as well as a <a href="https://renow.public.lu/fr.html">Web Strategy</a> focusing on web accessibility have existed for more than 15 years now.</p><p>The <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/en/publications/document-de-reference/panin-2021.html" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">National Action Plan for Digital Inclusion</a><span resource="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/en/publications/document-de-reference/panin-2021.html" property="dct:title" content="National Action Plan for Digital Inclusion"/> was drawn up by the Ministry for Digitalisation, in close consultation with an interdepartmental working group, and with the help of bilateral exchanges with associations and various non-State actors close to populations which may be isolated from the digital world. Published in September 2021, it includes 40 concrete initiatives spread over three strategic axes to improve digital inclusion in Luxembourg and avoid a widening of the digital divide. With the help of the interdepartmental working group, the Ministry for Digitalisation will continue monitoring its implementation and annually assessing the progress of the various initiatives.</p><p>As part of the implementation of the National Action Plan for Digital Inclusion, the Ministry for Digitalisation launched a call for projects to finance pilot projects promoting digital inclusion in Luxembourg for the year 2022&#x2013;2023.This call for projects is addressed to associations, private organisations, public institutions, municipalities, inter-municipal unions, professional chambers, training centres and public research institutes that are committed to digital inclusion. The projects submitted must fall within the scope of one or more of the following three strategic levers:</p><ul><li>Increasing digital motivation and creating digital trust;</li><li>Facilitating access to digital; and</li><li>Developing digital skills.</li></ul><p>These levers bring together a set of concrete initiatives of the Ministry for Digitalisation and the actors involved in the development of the National Action Plan for Digital Inclusion. In particular, the third strategic lever focuses on the development of digital skills and digital citizenship to enable individuals to navigate the digital world in a more autonomous and safer way, regardless of their age, level of education or gender. </p><p>The call for projects will be published on an annual basis. The 2022 edition saw 28 dossiers submitted to the Ministry, of which six were awarded a financing agreement. Five projects aimed to develop basic digital skills amongst populations that are at risk of digital exclusion and one even specifically dealt with gender imbalance. The projects&#x2019; results will be evaluated following the submission of the final report. The six winners of the &#x2018;2022 Digital Inclusion Award&#x2019; were the following:</p><ul><li>Autisme Luxembourg ASBL, for the creation of a social platform for people with autism;</li><li>Club Haus op der Heed, for the provision of tablets with mobile data as well as individual support to familiarise the elderly in municipalities in the North of the country with the new media;</li><li>GoldenMe ASBL, for the development and strengthening of a network of intergenerational &#x2018;smartphone caf&#xe9;s&#x2019; in different municipalities of the Grand Duchy;</li><li>St&#xeb;ftung H&#xeb;llef Doheem, for the promotion of digital literacy among vulnerable elderly people in the ten psycho-geriatric centres (CPG) of their network;</li><li>The City of Dudelange, for the creation of an &#x2018;Internet Stuff&#x2019; to promote and present the digital world to the elderly through exchanges and training in a safe, familiar and friendly environment; and</li><li>WIDE&amp;CO, for the provision of &#x2018;meeting points&#x2019; for women with individual advice regarding IT and digital issues.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eHealth Strategy</p><p>The government of Luxembourg already approved in 2006 a first National eHealth Strategy, which has been gradually updated since then. In this context, with the aim of drawing up the National Health Plan until 2023, the Ministers of Health and Social Security brought together in 2020 the key players in the Luxembourg health system within the framework of the &#x2018;<em>Gesondheetsd&#xeb;sch&#x2019;</em>. The involved actors formed six thematic groups, including one dedicated to the use of new technologies in the field of health, to jointly identify the challenges, analyse the different possible scenarios and propose priority measures. Projects emerging from this working group include the following: (i) the establishment of an inter-ministerial committee responsible for coordinating digitisation in the field of eHealth in line with the National eHealth Strategy; (ii) the establishment of a permanent committee responsible for promoting and coordinating innovation in the field of health; (iii) the proposal of an updated National eHealth Strategy to be integrated into the National Health Plan; and (iv) the implementation of a roadmap adapted to digital health.</p><p>More in general, the government continues promoting the National eHealth Strategy to facilitate the exchange and secure electronic sharing of health data between health professionals and patients, and also to enable better monitoring and better coordination of the patients&#x2019; healthcare. In pursuit of this objective, the <a href="https://www.esante.lu/portal/fr/">National Agency for Shared Health Information (eSant&#xe9;) </a>has developed and implemented the National eHealth Platform, which includes basic urban development components to provide various services to patients, healthcare providers and suppliers of digital health solutions. New eHealth services launched in 2020 through the National eHealth Platform include a teleconsultation and telemonitoring system, as well as an electronic vaccination card which is currently in a pilot phase. Furthermore, since the end of 2019, eSant&#xe9; has gradually deployed the Shared Medical File (<em>dossier de soins partag&#xe9;,</em> DSP) to all persons affiliated with Luxembourg social security. The <a href="https://sante.public.lu/fr/campagnes/2020/myDsp.html">DSP</a> is a free, personal and secure electronic health record that centralises essential patient health data in one place. In October 2020, Paulette Lenert, Minister of Health and Minister Delegate for Social Security, and Romain Schneider, Minister of Social Security, <a href="https://gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2020/10-octobre/06-presentation-mydsp.html">presented</a> the DSP and the associated &#x2018;My DSP&#x2019; communication campaign.</p><p>Finally, in June 2019, Luxembourg also launched the <a href="https://gouvernement.lu/en/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2020/01-janvier/20-schneider-technologies-sante.html">EU&#x2019;s first cross-border eHealth service</a>. This new feature of the eSant&#xe9; portal ensures a smooth and fast electronic exchange of patient summaries between various countries of the EU. More concretely, it ensures that any European patient visiting a doctor during their stay in Luxembourg are able to benefit from this service and request that their patient summary be shared with their doctor in another European country. </p><h2>Innovative technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategic Vision for Artificial Intelligence </p><p>On 24 May 2019, Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister and Minister for Communications and Media presented the <a href="https://gouvernement.lu/fr/publications/rapport-etude-analyse/minist-economie/intelligence-artificielle/data-driven-innovation.html">Strategic Vision for Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a>. It includes political guidelines applying both to AI and the ongoing digitalisation of key economic sectors with the objective of supporting the emergence of a sustainable and reliable national economy. In this sense, the development of a strategic vision for AI represents a national priority for Luxembourg. In addition to implementing detailed actions and engaging citizens on their attitude towards AI, the document identifies three goals for the country: </p><ul><li>Becoming one of the most digitally advanced societies in the world, in particular within the European Union (EU);</li><li>Establishing Luxembourg as a sustainable, data-driven economy; and</li><li>Supporting the development of AI with a human-centred approach.</li></ul><p>At State level, Luxembourg&#x2019;s Strategic Vision for AI led to the creation of the <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr/dossiers/2021/AI4Gov.html">AI4Gov Inter&#x2011;ministerial Committee</a>, made up of representatives of the Ministry for Digitalisation, the SMC, and the Information and Press Service (SIP). To promote the use of AI within the public administration, the AI4Gov Inter-ministerial Committee launched two calls for experimentation projects in AI and data science, in October 2019 and December 2020 respectively, addressed to public actors. In addition to providing technical assistance for projects, the Committee also offers legal and ethical support through the creation, at the beginning of 2020, of an inter&#x2011;ministerial working group called &#x2018;AI Legal &amp; Ethics Working Group&#x2019;. This group is made up of the Ministry for Digitalisation, the SMC, the SIP and the High Commission for National Protection. Through the support of AI4Gov projects and dialogue with project leaders, this working group carries out a preliminary assessment of the legal and ethical risks associated with the projects, thus laying the groundwork for the approach to AI governance in the sector. </p><p>On 20 November 2020, the government undertook an additional step in the pursuing of the national Strategic Vision for AI by launching a public consultation on the perception of AI among the population and societal actors. The results of the consultation were presented by Prime Minister Xavier Bettel in spring 2021.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Call for Projects</p><p>The AI4Gov calls for projects align with the government&#x2019;s desire to continue to promote experimentation and adoption of new technologies such as AI and data science within public administration. A first version of the call for projects was launched at an inter&#x2011;ministerial coordination meeting as part of the Strategic Vision for AI on 14 October 2019. </p><p>The 2020 and 2021 calls resulted in the selection of the following experimentation projects (of which three are being implemented at the moment): (i) Extopia: extraction of topographic objects &#x2013; Cadastre and Topography Administration; (ii) Facial recognition for the Media Library &#x2013; SIP; (iii) AI for eLuxembourgensia &#x2013; National Library of Luxembourg; (iv) Transkribus: transcriptions of handwritten documents &#x2013; National Archives of Luxembourg; and (v) Statistics with mobile phone data &#x2013; STATEC.</p><p>The 2022 call resulted in the selection of the following projects: (i) ADEM Interact: conversational AI platform which can assist agents who receive messages from job seekers formulating personalised responses; (ii) ADEM Profiling: support model for agents to assess which job seekers need what measures as well as what levels of support are needed to access employment, based on the analysis of existing data at the Employment Development Agency (<em>Agence pour le d&#xe9;veloppement de l&#x2019;emploi</em>, ADEM); (iii) CNS Phonebot: Phonebot powered by AI applied to the use case of the Chatbot/Phonebot service supporting the agents of the National Health Fund (<em>Caisse Nationale de Sant&#xe9;</em>, CNS) in their work. The Luxembourgish language is not yet compatible with technologies to perform Text-to-Speech (TTS) or Speech-to-Text (STT) for Phonebots. As a result, the project aims to change this situation and offer optimal service to all policyholders. </p><p>Building on the success of previous calls for projects, the AI4Gov initiative is launching the fourth call for administrations wishing to experiment with AI and data science.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Blockchain White Paper and Public Sector Blockchain</p><p>In June 2018, the Ministry of Economy, with the support of the Luxembourg Institute of Standardisation, Accreditation, Safety and Quality of Products and Services (<em>Institut luxembourgeois de la normalisation, de l&apos;accr&#xe9;ditation, de la s&#xe9;curit&#xe9; et qualit&#xe9; des produits et services</em>, ILNAS), published a <a href="https://gouvernement.lu/dam-assets/documents/actualites/2018/06-juin/13-ilnas-blockchain.pdf">White Paper on Technical Standardisation</a> related to blockchain technology. The objective of the white paper was to describe the main developments related to blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. A comprehensive analysis is presented by considering: </p><ul><li>Blockchain concepts and technology;</li><li>The economic and business impact; and</li><li>Technical standardisation.</li></ul><p>In 2019, the Ministry for Digitalisation, together with the Inter-communal Union for Information Management (<em>Syndicat Intercommunal de Gestion Informatique,</em> SIGI) and the CTIE, announced the <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites.gouvernement+fr+actualites+toutes_actualites+communiques+2019+05-mai+23-hansen-blockchain.html">creation of the first public sector blockchain (PSBC)</a>. In 2020, the PSBC was set up at technical level by establishing the network with nodes at the CTIE, the SIGI and the Teleinformation Network of National Education and Research (<em>R&#xe9;seau T&#xe9;l&#xe9;informatique de l&apos;Education Nationale et de la Recherche, </em>Restena), as well as at governance level through the signing of a governance agreement between the Ministry for Digitalisation and the SIGI and through the establishment of a Governance Committee between the above-mentioned partners and the technical working groups. </p><p>In 2021, the online application for higher education State financial aid was end-to-end digitalised based on the PSBC. Students who apply for financial aid for higher education will receive the approval of a student loan by the Ministry of Higher Education and Research in the form of a certificate with a QR code. They can then use it to apply for their loan from their bank electronically in a fully secure and traceable way. The QR code allows the bank officer to verify that the supporting document is authentic and that the loan instalment is being requested from only one bank. Authenticity is verified through the PSBC, which is used to notarise the certificates issued.</p><p>In this context, numerous associations and initiatives, partly supported also by the government, promote the research, teaching and development of blockchain technology in Luxembourg. In particular, in December 2019 five of the main players, INFRACHAIN, L&#xeb;tzBlock, the Luxembourg House of Financial Technology (LHoFT), the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST) and the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust of the University of Luxembourg (SnT), launched a collaboration to strengthen Luxembourg as a European blockchain hub.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">European Blockchain Services Infrastructure and EBSILUX</p><p>The Ministry for Digitalisation is also involved at European level in the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP), a collaboration between 29 countries (EU Member States, Norway and Liechtenstein) and the European Commission which is setting up a European blockchain (European Blockchain Services Infrastructure, EBSI). This infrastructure distributed at European level will make it possible to launch interoperable and cross&#x2011;border services, such as data notarisation and support for a digital identity. Since 2020, the Ministry has been operating an EBSI node in collaboration with INFRACHAIN, joining the 28 nodes already operational in various European countries.</p><p>In 2020, the Ministry for Digitalisation, INFRACHAIN, the LIST and the SnT partnered to develop the <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/en/dossiers/2022/ebsilux.html">EBSILUX project</a>. Co-funded by the EU, this project integrates Luxembourg into the EBSI.

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>EuroHPC</p><p>In an effort to strengthen the digital competitiveness of Luxembourg and Europe, the government signed a European High-Performance Computing (HPC) declaration, also referred to as <a href="https://meco.gouvernement.lu/">EuroHPC</a>. EuroHPC provides for collaboration in setting up an EU-wide HPC network initiated by Luxembourg. In signing, Luxembourg, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Portugal and the Netherlands reinforced the Europe 2020 Strategy by helping secure the computing capabilities needed for the EU&#x2019;s competitiveness as a digital economy. In this framework, Luxembourg is also part of the EuroHPC network of HPC Competence Centres.</p><p>On 25 June 2018, the European Commission decided to establish the EuroHPC joint headquarters in Luxembourg, with the aim to equip the EU with a pre-exascale and petascale infrastructure (1&#xa0;015 calculation operations per second) by 2020, and develop the technologies and applications needed to reach the exascale level (1&#xa0;018 calculation operations per second) by 2023. </p><ul><li>In 2019, Luxembourg was also selected to host a supercomputer that will serve public and private users, and will be part of the EuroHPC network of supercomputers. Luxembourg&#x2019;s contribution to the EuroHPC initiative, namely the high-performance computer named MeluXina, was inaugurated in June 2021 and started being operational in November 2021. It was immediately ranked 1<sup>st</sup> in Europe in the Green500 list and 4<sup>th</sup> worldwide. This high-performance computer is currently taking shape in the data centre in Bissen. In addition, the University of Luxembourg is also home to a high&#x2011;performance computer and a EUR 10 million budget has been allocated for a new, faster one.</li><li>Finally, Luxembourg is leading the consortium that was selected in September 2021 by international experts as winner of the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (JU) call for projects to create and implement the first pan-European Master of Science (MSc) programme in HPC. The experts praised the high quality of the proposal and expressed their trust in Luxembourg to be able to mobilise all the stakeholders and together deliver on this ambitious educational project. Eight graduating universities (FAU in N&#xfc;rnberg, KTH in Stockholm, Polimi in Milan, UniSofia in Sofia, Sorbonne in Paris, Uni.lu in Luxembourg, UPC in Barcelona and USI in Lugano), and 60 public and private sector participants constitute the consortium led by Luxembourg. Funded by the EuroHPC JU, the MSc programme will link academic excellence to the current and future challenges of the European businesses, industry and public sector in the multidisciplinary field of HPC. The modular curriculum and partnership with the European HPC industry will provide students with distinct qualifications and outstanding career prospects in the rapidly expanding field of HPC. In September 2022, the first students of the newly created <a href="https://eumaster4hpc.uni.lu">European Master</a> in HPC started their 2&#x2011;year programme. </li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-969.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>National Supercomputer Centre LuxProvide</p><p><a href="https://luxprovide.lu/">LuxProvide</a> is the national HPC centre in charge of the planning, installation and operation of MeluXina. The mission of LuxProvide, headquartered in Bissen, is to facilitate access to the use of the computational capabilities of the national supercomputer MeluXina by setting up a competence centre in collaboration with Luxinnovation, the national innovation agency, and the University of Luxembourg, providing dedicated support to all kind of users in their HPC projects.</p><p>MeluXina will support Luxembourg&#x2019;s Data-driven Innovation Strategy, contributing to building a digital, sustainable and reliable economy by making HPC accessible to businesses of all sizes (<a href="https://www.bmwk.de/Redaktion/EN/Artikel/Industry/ipcei-cis.html">IPCEI-CIS</a>). This specific IPCEI will create a cloud-edge continuum, and grant the right for applications and data to freely &#x2018;roam&#x2019; from one cloud provider to another (see the data portability right granted by the General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR), with a special focus on edge cloud computing. Luxembourg will contribute to the IPCEI with a special focus on open source cybersecurity tools, like Security Operation Centres (SOCs), and the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) tools for cloud and edge-cloud, generating huge positive externalities in terms of synergies. Luxembourg will also provide privacy and trade secrets preserving technologies for cloud that are also capable of running on edge nodes (for instance Industry 4.0 installations). Luxembourg has put a special focus on cross-company and cross&#x2011;border collaboration and the capitalisation of synergies. To achieve this, all documentation, application programming interfaces (APIs), products and services will be published in open source via a resource centre becoming the first Luxembourg Open-Source Promotion Office (OSPO). An open cybersecurity data space will be created where the connected data lakes will be running on edge cloud to guarantee low latencies to large consumers and contributors. The data space as well as the resource centre providing access to documentation and open source software are implemented as edge nodes connected to the high-performance computer MeluXina and the Data Exchange Platform.</p><p>Luxembourg is financing the IPCEI-CIS initiative with a national State aid funding amounting to maximum EUR 25 million for the next three years, of which EUR 2 million are allocated to the development of the edge node with the open cybersecurity data lake in close proximity of MeluXina to enable secure machine learning. The first projects were received in the fourth quarter of 2022 and in the first half of 2023 the Luxembourg State Aid Commission will decide upon the conformity of the projects with State aid rules. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ultra-high-Speed Broadband Strategy 2021&#x2013;2025</p><p>In October 2021, Luxembourg&#x2019;s government put forward the <a href="https://digital-luxembourg.public.lu/initiatives/broadband-strategy-2021-25">Ultra-high Speed Broadband Strategy 2021&#x2013;2025</a>, following the government&#x2019;s broader objective of fostering a digital society that benefits all residents. </p><p>Building on the sound basis of a high-quality and scalable communication infrastructure developed over the past decade, the new strategy defines two main areas of intervention: (i) reduction of the digital divide in the Luxembourgish society; and (ii) contribution to dynamism and competitiveness within the telecommunication sector. The strategy operationalises these two areas of intervention by tackling existing gaps within the telecommunication network. In order to fill these gaps, the strategy sets five main objectives:</p><ul><li>Make connectivity accessible to all; </li><li>Accelerate the transition of households and businesses to more efficient and sustainable technologies;</li><li>Accelerate the deployment of future-proof infrastructure, while respecting technological neutrality; </li><li>Improve transparency and strengthen consumer protection; and</li><li>Develop Luxembourg as the launchpad of choice for ICT service providers of today and tomorrow. </li><li>The first objective was implemented in 2022 by introducing a voucher scheme, supporting households in a challenging financial situation by reducing the price for a fixed internet subscription by 10 EUR per month. For 2023, the priority will be implementing objectives 2 and 3, i.e. promoting the take-up of future-proof ultra-high speed broadband connectivity solutions and eliminating white spots, targeting areas with no very high capacity network (VHCN) connectivity.</li><li>In order to support the national Ultra-high Speed Broadband and 5G strategies, MyConnectivity was created in early December 2021 as an economic interest group (GIE). Its creation is based on the strategic interest to accelerate and improve the connectivity of private households and businesses in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. This will help bringing digital public administration services closer to the citizens. This GIE was created jointly by the State, via the Media, Connectivity and Digital Policy Service (<em>Service des m&#xe9;dias, de la connectivit&#xe9; et de la politique num&#xe9;rique</em>, SMC), and by the LU-CIX Management GIE, due to its close contact to players in the field of telecommunications and connectivity.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">5G Strategy</p><p>In September 2018, the SMC of the Ministry of State launched the <a href="https://digital-luxembourg.public.lu/stories/luxembourgs-5g-strategy#:~:text=The Government believes that 5G,part of our national infrastructure.">5G Strategy for Luxembourg</a>. It pursues the following objectives:</p><ul><li><em>Assigning the necessary spectrum</em>: freeing the necessary spectrum bands and assigning them in a suitable way to the interested mobile network operators;</li><li><em>Supporting the technical roll-out:</em> supporting the technical roll-out (e.g. access to public infrastructure) based on the existing regulatory framework;</li><li><em>Answering citizens&#x2019; concerns</em>: ensuring transparent communication of the roll-out process and the scientific data about electromagnetic fields (EMFs);</li><li><em>Pioneering a citizen-centric 5G network</em>: organising a series of conferences (see below) and call for projects, as well as challenging all stakeholders to utilise the potential of the 5G network by triggering pilot projects that bring added value to the society in the fields of eHealth, smart mobility and digital communities; and</li><li><em>Developing an innovative mindset.</em></li><li>As a complement to the elaboration and publication of the national 5G Strategy, the SMC organised conferences as well as experience sharing sessions with regards to the 5G technology. The first conference took place in December 2018, a second conference was organized in December 2019 and the third conference took place in October 2021. More information can be found at <a href="http://www.5g.lu">www.5g.lu</a>. </li></ul><p>As per the 2019 Broadband Coverage in Europe report, approximately 95% of households in Luxembourg have access to a connection with a speed beyond 100Mbps, via either fiber&#x2011;to&#x2011;the&#x2011;home (FTTH) or coaxial cable (DOCSIS 3.1). Even in rural areas, almost every household has access to such a connection (approximately 92%).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Cross-border Corridors</p><p>One element of the EU 5G Strategy is the deployment of cross-border corridors along the major transportation routes. Luxembourgish stakeholders have been very involved in this regard, with both telecom operator and research centres but also other organisations implied in several of the European projects.</p><p>For instance, the <a href="https://5gcroco.eu/">5G CroCo</a> (Cross&#x2011;Border Control) was a European research project that provided a 5G coverage of the Luxembourg portion of the motorway section linking Metz (France), Merzig (Germany) and the Grand Duchy. The project consortium plans to further exploit it and enlarge its scope.</p><p>Furthermore, two other corridors are currently being worked on: </p><ul><li>The 5G DeLux project focuses on enabling seamless mobility at European borders as well as connected and automated mobility (CAM). Partners and consortium members are Telekom Deutschland, Post Luxembourg and the BMW Group. This project aims to develop and introduce a seamless handover solution for 4G and 5G, and to define a European standardised blueprint. The key motivation is to provide seamless cross-border mobility for customers of all participating mobile network operators;</li><li>The 5G MELUSINA project aims to deliver an inception study to prepare the implementation of 5G infrastructure along a rail cross-border section of the North Sea-Mediterranean TEN-T Corridor between Metz (France) and Luxembourg City (Luxembourg), to the benefit of train passengers&#x2019; connectivity and digitalisation of rail operations. The study will be carried out by a consortium involving both rail and mobile network operators from France and Luxembourg.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Calls for Projects (5G)</p><p>In 2019, the SMC launched a first national call for projects. Following the evaluation by an expert committee and the review by an inter-ministerial commission, eight projects were launched in 2021, covering a range of thematic areas, from EMF measuring to eHealth and smart metering, to 5G fixed wireless access applications. All projects focus on how citizens can use and benefit from the technology. The SMC also launched a second national call for projects in the framework of the national 5G Strategy and the conference&#xa0;<a href="http://smc.gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites.gouv_smc+en+actualites+articles+5GConference2021.html" target="_blank">&#x2018;Connecting tomorrow - 5G, broadband and beyond&#x2019;</a>&#xa0;which took place in Luxembourg in October 2021. Three science communication projects were retained. All projects will be finished by the end of 2023. The main goal of both calls for projects was to stimulate the take-up of 5G technology and the creation of a national 5G ecosystem.</p><p>A description of all the eleven 5G pilot projects that were selected in the first two 5G calls for projects issued by the SMC in 2019 and 2021 can be found at <a href="http://www.5g.lu">www.5g.lu</a>. Among these, one relevant pilot project relating the deployment of VHCN in Luxembourg is based in a rural community. With this project, the local authority of Waldbillig tested the reliability and the technical characteristics of a fixed wireless access (FWA). About 80 households could benefit from such an advanced wireless connection, while the streets were mainly still only relying on old copper infrastructure. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">GovTech</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-970.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>GovTech Lab</p><p>The Ministry for Digitalisation and its technological arm, the CTIE, initiated the GovTech Lab in 2020. It is a joint initiative that aims to encourage and support a culture of innovation and change within the State in order to rethink existing procedures and operational flows, and integrate principles such as digital by default, design thinking or service by design when conceiving new solutions. </p><p>To achieve its mission, the GovTech Lab launches calls for solutions. In 2022, it launched two new innovation partnerships. In March, a videoconferencing solution that can be integrated into government sites was sought via the &#x2018;Virtual Meeting Room&#x2019; call for solutions. This solution will allow citizens to exchange with a government official virtually without having to go to the respective administration. In September, the &#x2018;Simplify Legi&#x2019; call for solutions was launched with the aim of collaborating with an external partner to develop a technological solution for identifying administrative procedures and their complexity in legislative texts using AI. </p><p>In 2022, the GovTech Lab also introduced a second channel for launching calls for solutions - SpeedUP. This approach is designed to look for innovative or already existing technological solutions and has a shorter duration than the innovation partnership. Three SpeedUPs were launched in 2022: (i) a legal study for the implementation of a digital mandate; (ii) an impact and feasibility analysis on open web content for the public sector; (iii) and a dynamic data visualisation solution. </p><p>Furthermore, the Govtech Lab works on creating a GovTech community through the organisation of specialised events, thereby complementing the existing ecosystem of players who develop and promote innovative solutions. Following the opening of its physical space, specifically designed to foster co-creation, collaboration and innovation, the GovTech Lab has launched a series of activities. It invites government officials and private sector actors to present interesting use cases, projects, initiatives and technologies with the aim of fostering exchange between different Ministries and administrations, as well as between the public and private sectors. It also organises hackathons, ideathons, workshops as well as a series of recurring events. Different formats have been developed for different types of audiences: GovTech Afterwork, Technobreakfast, eGov Exchange and GovTech Experiment.

This law transposed into Luxembourgish law Directive (EU) 2102/2016 of 26 October 2016 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies. It supports the objectives of the Digital Luxembourg<em> </em>government strategy to promote access to new technologies for every citizen.</p><p>Though the text focuses on accessibility for people with disabilities, it ultimately benefits all citizens. Indeed, everyone should benefit from improved access to public sector services via websites and mobile applications, and from services and information that facilitate their daily lives and the exercise of their rights at the level of the public dimension and at Union level, including the right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Union and the right to freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. </p><p>In this context, the SIP has the responsibility to verify every year a certain number of websites and applications provided by the public sector organisations and to assume a role in the sensibilisation efforts. All documents concerning this activity are available publicly <a href="https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/?q=audit">here</a> and <a href="https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/digital-accessibility-monitoring-report-2020-2021/">here</a>.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Reuse of Public Sector Information </p><p>On 11 November 2021, the Parliament adopted the <a href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2021/11/29/a836/jo" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">law</a><span resource="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2021/11/29/a836/jo" property="eli:title" content="law"/> transposing Directive 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information. Two key elements of the new law are (i) a significant extension of the scope, including henceforth public undertakings as well as research data; and (ii) the introduction of high-value datasets. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Archiving</p><p>The <a href="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2015/07/25/n1/jo" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law on Electronic Archiving </a><span resource="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2015/07/25/n1/jo" property="eli:title" content="Law on Electronic Archiving "/>was adopted on 25 July 2015 (Law of 25 July 2015 relating to Electronic Archiving and amending: 1.

The purpose of the new law was to define the framework for the implementation of a policy for opening citizens&#x2019; administrative documents held by government departments, municipalities, local authorities and public institutions, and placed under the supervision of the State or municipalities.</p><p>Under this law, a newly created commission, the <a href="https://cad.gouvernement.lu/en.html">Commission on Access to Documents</a> (<em>Commission d&apos;acc&#xe8;s aux documents</em>, CAD) issues opinions about issues regarding the application of this law in order to ensure the right of access to documents at the conditions foreseen by the law.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eIDAS</p><p>The <a href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2020/07/17/a644/jo" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law of 17 July 2020</a><span resource="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2020/07/17/a644/jo" property="eli:title" content="Law of 17 July 2020"/> modified the amended Law of 14 August 2000 on Electronic Commerce (the&#xa0;eCommerce law) bringing it into line with Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation).&#xa0;The new law represents the last piece in Luxembourg&#x2019;s comprehensive and robust legal framework on trust services (including eSignatures and eArchiving). </p><p>In 2021, the European Commission published a proposal to revise the eIDAS Regulation. The proposal provides for the federated electronic authentication and signature service to evolve towards interoperable electronic wallets at European level. At the same time, a technical group is developing a technical concept (toolbox) in which the Ministry for Digitalisation and the CTIE participate. </p><p>The Ministry for Digitalisation and the CTIE also take part in the consortium &#x2018;Pilots for the European Digital Identity Wallet&#x2019; (POTENTIAL). The latter submitted a project which was selected in December 2022 by the European Commission to pilot new European prototypes around the European Digital Identity Wallet. 148 participants from 19 EU Member States and Ukraine joined forces in the POTENTIAL consortium to pilot the new EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) prototypes through test use cases (electronic government services, account opening, mobile driving license and remote qualified electronic signature). The project aims to improve citizens&#x2019; access to reliable and secure electronic identity means and services such as electronic signatures or attestation attributes. This will allow citizens to store their identity in a secure digital wallet valid across borders. The mission is to shape and implement scenarios to test the European Digital Identity Wallet launched by the European Commission.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Draft Law on the Electronic Signature of Administrative Documents</p><p>To facilitate and accelerate the transmission of administrative documents between the government and the various State administrations and services, as well as between the State services and citizens, it is proposed to introduce the possibility of affixing the electronic signature and the electronic seal in administrative matters. The amended Law of 14 August 2000 on Electronic Commerce already provides for the option of using an electronic signature for private documents. Similarly, the Draft Law on the Electronic Signature of Administrative Documents provides for the possibility of affixing electronic signatures or seals to administrative documents issued by administrative authorities and to transmit them electronically. </p><p>The purpose of affixing a digital identifier to a public document is to guarantee digital inclusion by allowing to continue to make available the various documents and files in paper form to citizens who cannot or do not wish to opt for a digital approach, while guaranteeing the possibility for the administrative authorities and other entities to electronically sign administrative acts. The digital identifier thus allows any citizen to whom the document is addressed, and any administration to which a citizen presents a copy of the act, to access the place where the original document is stored and to become acquainted with it. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eCommerce Law </p><p>The <a href="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2000/08/14/n8/jo" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">amended eCommerce Law</a><span resource="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2000/08/14/n8/jo" property="eli:title" content="amended eCommerce Law"/> of 14 August 2000, complemented by the <a href="https://data.legilux.public.lu/filestore/eli/etat/leg/rgd/2001/06/01/n3/jo/fr/html/eli-etat-leg-rgd-2001-06-01-n3-jo-fr-html.html" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Regulation on Electronic Signatures and Electronic Payments</a><span resource="https://data.legilux.public.lu/filestore/eli/etat/leg/rgd/2001/06/01/n3/jo/fr/html/eli-etat-leg-rgd-2001-06-01-n3-jo-fr-html.html" property="eli:title" content="Regulation on Electronic Signatures and Electronic Payments"/> of 1 June 2001, transposed the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:en:HTML" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">EU Directive on Electronic Signatures</a><span resource="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:en:HTML" property="eli:title" content="EU Directive on Electronic Signatures"/> (1999/93/EC). The act&#x2019;s primary importance resides in the recognition of eSignatures and eContracts. Unlike the directive it was based on, it does not use the term &#x2018;advanced&#x2019; eSignature but rather recognises a &#x2018;qualified&#x2019; level of eSignature. It also differs from the directive and similar legislation in other Member States insofar as it legally recognises electronic wills and electronic deeds, and implements the customer&#x2019;s right to withdraw from an electronic contract within seven days of its creation, free of questions and penalties, with full reimbursement of any money paid to the seller. Differently, the act closely follows the directive in terms of information requirements from seller to customer, the seller&#x2019;s obligation to acknowledge reception of an order, the rules governing the liability and confidentiality requirements for certificate issuers (domestic and foreign), and provisions concerning the auditing and accreditation of certificate issuers.</p><p>Certification service providers can only issue certificates with the approval of the National Accreditation and Supervision Authority. Approved (qualified) certificates are valid for a maximum duration of three years and must be archived by the certification service provider for at least ten years. Certification providers also have to undergo periodic external security audits.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Privacy and Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">General Data Protection Regulation </p><p>In May 2018, the GDPR entered into force in the whole EU and therefore also in Luxembourg. The National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD), which celebrated its 20th anniversary on 1&#xa0;December 2022, is the relevant independent supervisory authority in Luxembourg. Its mission is to guarantee the respect of the rights of data subjects and the obligations of data controllers/processors in the context of the GDPR and other pieces of legislation related to the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data. The CNPD also acts as data controller to fulfil certain requirements regarding form and content, and represents Luxembourg at the European level in the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). Besides other guidance and awareness-raising activities, the CNPD develops with partners awareness&#x2011;raising courses on the GDPR and data protection for civil servants in public institutions, and for the private sector with a focus on small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups.</p><p>In the context of the 17th International Data Protection Day, the CNPD organised on 27 January 2023 a conference entitled &#x2018;The metaverse: what reality for privacy rights and freedoms?&#x2019;. The CNPD also participates in the annual &#x2018;Data Privacy Day&#x2019; conference, an annual event for people interested in data protection and privacy organised by the Restena Foundation and the University of Luxembourg in the framework of the International Data Protection Day. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act on the Organisation of the National Commission for Data Protection and the General Data Protection Scheme</p><p>The Act on the Organisation of the National Commission for Data Protection and the General Data Protection Scheme of 1 August 2018 repealed the previous act on data protection (amended act of 2 August 2002) and implemented the GDPR at national level. The aim of the law is to establish the CNPD as the national supervisory authority for the GDPR, conferring on it the corresponding extended tasks and powers as provided for by the GDPR. Furthermore, it defines the legal framework for the specific provisions of Luxembourgish law and in particular those relating to the supervision of employees.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Amended Act on Data Protection and Electronic Communications</p><p>The <a href="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2005/05/30/n4/jo" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">amended Act on Data Protection and Electronic Communications</a><span resource="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2005/05/30/n4/jo" property="eli:title" content="amended Act on Data Protection and Electronic Communications"/> of 30 May 2005, concerning the specific provisions for the protection of the individual as to the processing of personal data in the electronic communications sector, and amending Articles 88(2) and 88(4) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, transposes the amended Directive 2002/58/EC and covers the processing of personal data in the sector of electronic communications. The act governs personal data protection in the field of telecommunications and electronic communications, taking into account recent and foreseeable developments in the field of services and technologies involving electronic communications. It aims to protect the privacy of internet users (including protection against unsolicited commercial communications or &#x2018;spam&#x2019;) and users of added value services, such as GPS. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of Base Registries</h3><p>The creation of each base registry as well as access to its data are regulated by a specific law.

The government thus intends to create the starting conditions that will facilitate and make more efficient a complete digitalisation and a more extensive automation of the processes of verification, validation and payment of invoices at the level of public sector bodies. This will result in shorter payment terms, and more systematic digitisation and automation of public procurement, the direct consequence of which will be a gain in efficiency and a reduction in the administrative burden for companies. The main objective is to &#x201c;contribute, via an improvement in business productivity, to increasing the competitiveness of the private sector and therefore the competitiveness of the Luxembourg economy in general&#x201d;.</p><p>In particular, the law provides for the following obligations:</p><ul><li>For economic operators: to issue and transmit only compliant eInvoices, i.e. XML files or files containing XML, in the context of public procurement;</li><li>For public sector bodies: to use the common delivery network for the automated receipt of eInvoices, i.e. Peppol, and, as long as they do not have their own access point to Peppol, the access point of the CTIE;</li><li>For Ministries and State administrations: to use the CTIE&#x2019;s access point to Peppol.</li></ul><p>While the number of eInvoices issued and sent to public sector bodies was negligible before the entry into force of the amended law, more than 120&#xa0;000 eInvoices were received in 2022 by public sector bodies, and this despite the fact that small economic operators were not yet obliged to invoice electronically (only from 18 March 2023), and large and medium-sized economic operators had only been sending eInvoices since 18 May 2022 and 18 October 2022, respectively.

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>GovTech Lab Luxembourg</p><p>On 26 November 2020, Marc Hansen, Minister Delegate for Digitalisation, <a href="https://gouvernement.lu/en/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2020/11-novembre/26-hansen-govtechlab.html" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="presented" resource="https://gouvernement.lu/en/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2020/11-novembre/26-hansen-govtechlab.html">presented</a> the concept of the new <a href="https://govtechlab.public.lu/fr.html#who" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="govtech lab" resource="https://govtechlab.public.lu/fr.html#who">GovTech Lab</a> of the Luxembourg government. One of the Ministry&#x2019;s strategic axes is the development of eGovernment and the GovTech Lab constitutes an integral part of the actions that the Ministry is implementing in this area. The GovTech Lab combines GovTech and open innovation in order to accelerate the development and further improvement of digital public services. </p><p>The GovTech Lab, which is the result of a cooperation between the Ministry for Digitalisation and its technological arm, the CTIE, aims to encourage and support a culture of innovation and change within the State in order to rethink existing procedures and operational flows, and integrate principles such as digital by default, design thinking or service by design when conceiving new solutions. </p><p>For its calls for solutions, the Ministry for Digitalisation has opted to make the widest possible use of the innovation partnership, which allows a broader participation of external players thanks to a more open public procurement procedure which is articulated in different phases. In 2021, the Ministry for Digitalisation also set up SpeedUP, a faster way to launch calls for solutions more precisely for smaller-scale projects, or conceptual or juridical analyses. With a maximum of eight months from the launch of the call to the implementation of the solution, the SpeedUP procedure enables the Ministry to accelerate the identification of appropriate solutions as well as their integration.</p><p>In early 2022, the Ministry for Digitalisation also introduced a new collaborative platform enabling State agents to actively participate in the digitalisation of public services. This platform is based on a co-creative approach, and seeks ideas and proposals from State agents through the launch of calls for challenges issued by Ministries. The input collected through the platform will be transformed into calls for solutions by the GovTech Lab in the form of innovation partnerships or SpeedUPs, or into regular projects by the CTIE.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">luxembourg.lu</p><p>The <a href="https://luxembourg.public.lu/en.html" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="official portal of the grand duchy of luxembourg" resource="https://luxembourg.public.lu/en.html">official portal of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg</a> offers general information on various subjects, together with a thematic directory<strong> </strong>of<strong> </strong>links that guides users to sites that offer detailed information on their topic(s) of interest. This site is useful not only for the inhabitants of Luxembourg, but also for the consular and diplomatic network as well as any foreigners wishing to find pertinent information on Luxembourg. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Guichet.lu</p><p>On 17 November 2008, the government of Luxembourg launched the <a href="https://guichet.public.lu/en.html" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="guichet.lu portal" resource="https://guichet.public.lu/en.html">Guichet.lu portal</a>, which targets both citizens and companies, and acts as a single point of contact (SPOC) for their interactions with the administrative bodies. The portal was then <a href="https://gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2018/06-juin/25-presentation-guichetlu.html" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="relaunched" resource="https://gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2018/06-juin/25-presentation-guichetlu.html">relaunched</a> on its tenth anniversary.</p><p>Guichet.lu comprises information on various topics and related administrative procedures, grouped by ten major themes for citizens and ten major themes for companies.</p><p>The portal&#x2019;s primary objective is to improve<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>value<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>quality<strong> </strong>of eServices, integrating various administrative formalities on a single internet portal that gathers all relevant procedures, forms and information made available by the State. With an offer of functionalities that is constantly growing, the interactive portal MyGuichet.lu allows its users to: </p><ul><li>Carry out administrative procedures in a simple and transparent manner reusing their personal data from authentic sources;</li><li>View their personal data held by official bodies through authentic sources, e.g. information on obtained housing aid;</li><li>Receive electronic documents issued by official bodies (eDelivery); and</li><li>Book an appointment online with administrative bodies (for the recent evolution of MyGuichet.lu, see below).</li><li>In order to make full use of the different functionalities, such as authentic sources and eDelivery, users have to log in to their personal space with an electronic authentication certificate (<a href="https://www.luxtrust.com/en/about-us/who-we-are" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="luxtrust token" resource="https://www.luxtrust.com/en/about-us/who-we-are">LuxTrust Token</a>, Smartcard, Signing Stick or ID Card). These certificates guarantee highly secure information exchanges and personal data confidentiality along with an eSignature.</li></ul><p>The CTIE has started a project to integrate a new low code platform in the CTIE infrastructure. This will facilitate the transformation of PDF forms into true webforms that can easily be submitted through MyGuichet.lu (with better user experience and better accessibility). Furthermore, since the end of 2019, 24 descriptive factsheets on administrative procedures have been published in German plain language (<em>Leichte Sprache</em>) on the Guichet.lu information portal, with the aim to help people with limited reading and writing skills to navigate and get information through the portal. Moreover, since 2022 the Guichet.lu team has also published four procedures in French plain language (<em>facile &#xe0; lire et &#xe0; comprendre</em>).</p><p>In July 2021, the CTIE also <a href="https://guichet.public.lu/fr/actualites/2021/juillet/05-app-myguichet.html" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="published" resource="https://guichet.public.lu/fr/actualites/2021/juillet/05-app-myguichet.html">published</a> the new mobile app MyGuichet.lu so that users can access digital public services directly on their smartphone. For more information on the app MyGuichet.lu and its evolution, see below. </p><p>The eGovernance Strategy 2021&#x2013;2025 mentioned in Section 3.1, drawn up jointly by the Ministry for Digitalisation and the CTIE, and the related roadmap established by the Inter-ministerial Committee for Digitalisation, imply that the CTIE as well as the public administrations undertake measures on the front-end level (i.e. the interfaces of the online public services that face the citizens/companies) and back-end level (i.e. the applications that allow government entities to process the citizens&#x2019; requests) in line with the principles of &#x2018;digital by default&#x2019;, &#x2018;Once-Only&#x2019;, &#x2018;inclusion and accessibility&#x2019;, &#x2018;openness and transparency&#x2019;, &#x2018;reliability and security&#x2019; as well as &#x2018;interoperability and standardisation&#x2019;. With regard to the back-end level, since 2013 the generic back office for MyGuichet.lu is the administration counterpart of MyGuichet.lu and allows governmental bodies that do not have a specific back-office application to receive procedures transmitted by MyGuichet.lu. This is an accelerator for the digitalisation of procedures because no specific back office needs to be developed. Also, there are considerations to modify the national legislation in order to allow a digital signature on administrative acts. This will ensure that a governmental body can sign administrative decisions digitally and return them to the applicant also digitally, allowing to enlarge the offer of end-to-end digital procedures to citizens and companies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">MyGuichet.lu Application</p><p>On 5 July 2021, Marc Hansen, Minister Delegate for Digitalisation, presented the new mobile application MyGuichet.lu, developed by the CTIE. This application allows citizens to access their private space in MyGuichet.lu using their smartphone or tablet. In a world which is increasingly focused on mobile solutions, this new means of access to MyGuichet.lu is a major achievement in the context of the commitment set out in the eGovernance Strategy 2021&#x2013;2025 to offer citizens &#x2018;cross-media&#x2019; accessibility of digital public services, accessible on smartphones and tablets. This is an essential step towards a modernisation of digital public services. </p><p>Since its launch, the MyGuichet.lu app has offered a number of procedures and functions:</p><ul><li>Carrying out and following up administrative procedures;</li><li>Adding attachments using a mobile phone&#x2019;s camera;</li><li>Consulting communications; and</li><li>Directly accessing CovidCheck certificates.</li></ul><p>The range of possible procedures from the MyGuichet.lu app has then been regularly expanded and personal data which were only available in the MyGuichet.lu private space are now visible also using the mobile application.</p><p>Moreover, the functionality to electronically sign an online procedure via MyGuichet.lu has been integrated into the app. This new feature makes additional administrative procedures requiring an eSignature available through the app, such as the declaration of change of residence or postal voting requests for elections. Furthermore, the online payment functionality (by credit card or smartphone) allows the user to pay for his/her procedure directly through the app MyGuichet.lu. These two features make it possible to offer more online procedures through the app. Overall, the goal is to persuade more citizens/businesses to interact online with administrations.</p><p>Currently, people must have a private eSpace on MyGuichet.lu and pair it with the app before they can use all its features. In order to enable more citizens to use MyGuichet.lu, developments are underway to:</p><ul><li>make the pairing between the private eSpace and the app optional: the user can then authenticate directly in the app and use all its features (by mid-2023);</li><li>allow new users to register and create their private eSpace directly in the app.</li></ul><p>These developments address new trends in society, whereby mobile equipment is increasingly replacing conventional computers. This measure is directly in line with the eGovernance Strategy 2021&#x2013;2025, which provides for the cross-media development of online public services and supports an omni-channel policy for the delivery of public services (by the end of 2023). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">MyGuichet.lu Web Portal - Modernisation of MyGuichet.lu&#x2019;s Private eSpace</p><p>The CTIE teams have invested their efforts in modernising the technologies on which MyGuichet.lu&#x2019;s private eSpace is based. Users, citizens and businesses now benefit from a web interface that is even more responsive and adapted to the new habits of internet users. One of the main novelties lies in the responsive design principle, that is to say that the interface adapts now to any type of device. Users can therefore connect to MyGuichet.lu from their smartphone, tablet or computer through the browser, and use all the features wherever and whenever they want. The responsive design interface and the mobile application are both part of the strategy of the Ministry for Digitalisation and the CTIE to promote cross-media provision and omni-channel use of public services, i.e. to allow citizens and companies to use the channel (digital or analogue) and the device (smartphone, tablet or computer) that suits them best.</p><p>In addition, great efforts have been invested in the accessibility of the interface. The look has been modernised and brought closer to that which users know from the mobile app MyGuichet.lu, while the features known and appreciated by the public remain unchanged (see above). In order to better guide users, the online guide has also been completely reworked.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-975.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Currently 35 official documents carry a GouvCheck QR Code, whose authenticity can be verified by scanning the QR Code (on the document) with the GouvCheck app. </p><p>GouvCheck allows to print out an electronically signed document, and still be able to verify the eSignature and the authenticity of the information on the document. To that end, a GouvCheck QR code is put on the document, for example a certificate of residence. Anybody who wants to check the authenticity of the document (civil agent, citizen or others) downloads the GouvCheck app and scans the QR code. </p><p>The app validates the eSignature contained in the QR code and displays additional information that is also included in the QR code. This information should also be present in clear text on the document.

It is a public/private partnership created to manage the development of a common Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in order to secure eCommerce and eGovernment in Luxembourg. The consortium that was awarded the PKI contract was presented in July 2006. </p><p>LuxTrust is the standard solution used for qualified eID and eSignature in the context of online administrative procedures. It is used by all important banks for online banking and it is therefore offered by banks to their clients free of charge. Furthermore, the progressive introduction of biometric documents in Europe forces Member States to have highly secure certification services in order to protect their official documents. Consequently, LuxTrust will adhere to the relevant international standards in order to be in a position to protect the biometric documents issued in Luxembourg. This will initially apply to biometric passports.</p><p>Any EU citizen and business can use their own national eID scheme (if notified) to access public services on the personalised platform MyGuichet in Luxembourg. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Draft Secure Platform for Public Documents</p><p>The purpose of affixing a digital identifier to a public document is to guarantee digital inclusion by allowing to continue to make available the various documents and files in paper form to citizens who cannot or do not wish to opt for a digital approach, while guaranteeing the possibility for the administrative authorities and other entities to electronically sign administrative acts. The digital identifier thus allows any citizen to whom the document is addressed, and any administration to which a citizen presents a copy of the act, to access the place where the original document is stored and to become acquainted with it. </p><p>In this context, the Secure Platform for Public Documents will allow: </p><ul><li>The affixing of digital identifiers on public documents; </li><li>The electronic storage of originals with a digital identifier; and</li><li>Access to the storage location through a digital ID.</li></ul><p>The Secure Platform for Public Documents, together with the various provisions of the Draft Law on the Electronic Signature of Administrative Documents, will contribute to the digitalisation of the public administration, by facilitating the conclusion of administrative acts in digital format. Many internal procedures and procedures based on a signed act can thus be digitised.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Signature Verification and Validation Platform</p><p>The Electronic Signature Verification and Validation Platform aims to allow State agents to verify and validate electronic signatures of all European countries in accordance with the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. The user uploads the document to the platform, which validates the electronic signatures, stamps and timestamps present on the document on the basis of the European trusted lists. The platform then presents the results of the validation in a simplified way. It further allows to download a detailed report and print the validation summary in a print-friendly format. After the validation report is issued, the document is destroyed automatically on the platform.</p><p>With the aforementioned Draft Law on the Electronic Signature of Administrative Documents and Secure Platform for Public Documents, providing for the possibility to use qualified electronic signature in administrative matters, the needs in terms of verification of electronic signatures will increase. The Electronic Signature Verification and Validation Platform will address those needs.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Cybersecurity Competence Centre</p><p>The new <a href="https://www.c-3.lu/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="cybersecurity competence centre (c3)" resource="https://www.c-3.lu/">Cybersecurity Competence Centre (C3)</a>, established at the end of 2017, promotes the national cybersecurity ecosystem by focusing on three areas of expertise: observation, training and testing.

The project aims to implement a central platform offering all the functionalities necessary for electronic document and case management, and to deploy specific instances in each of the State entities.</p><p>The new Document Management System (DMS) has additional functionalities that go beyond a classic electronic document management tool and provides its users with case, process and workflow management. The new DMS focuses on document production, i.e. the creation of electronic documents, as well as their electronic signature and versioning. Moreover, a seamless integration with the State&#x2019;s eArchiving solution is assured, in order to guarantee the preservation and durability of the documents in accordance with legal obligations in terms of archiving. </p><p>In 2021 several activities were carried out in relation to the DMS:</p><ul><li>the platform was installed and deployed on the CTIE infrastructure;</li><li>the platform was interfaced with existing solutions, such as the digital archiving platform; </li><li>a first Proof-of-Concept (for the CTIE) was implemented; and</li><li>the on-boarding concept for the other administrations was implemented.</li></ul><p>In 2022 the component for the electronic management of documents was put into production.</p><p>With the entry into force of electronic invoicing, provided for by the law of 13 December 2021, the development teams implemented a module for the reception and centralised management of eInvoices. The module allows a homogenisation of the process of receipt of eInvoices based on the receipt, storage and management of all eInvoices transmitted to the Luxembourg State in a single and unique system. After deployment as a pilot by the Ministry for Digitalisation and the CTIE in 2022, the objective is to set up this module with all Ministries and administrations from 2023. Each State administration should therefore have access to Hive at the end of the deployment of this module and be able to familiarise themselves with the new software even before their dedicated on-boarding project is finished.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Data Centres</p><p>Taking full advantage of its strategic location, and of massive private and public sector investments, Luxembourg has become a key hub for ICT with <a href="https://datacenters-in-europe.com/data-centers/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="highly secured data centres" resource="https://datacenters-in-europe.com/data-centers/">highly secured data centres</a>.

In addition, members of the Inter-ministerial Committee for Digitalisation, which has also included the Once-Only principle in its roadmap as a priority action, are also part of the working group. The coordination and the Secretariat of the GTTT OOP are provided by the Ministry for Digitalisation. </p><p>During the first meeting of the GTTT OOP on 21 March 2022, its members decided to first call on sub-groups to study with a small number of people certain more specific aspects of the Once&#x2011;Only principle. Four sub-groups were created in 2022: </p><p>1. Legislation Sub-group: the sub-group analyses the opportunities, the challenges and the potential of the Once-Only principle from a legal point of view and reflects on possible solutions to generalise it at the level of the Luxembourg public sector. A first meeting took place on 18 October 2022;</p><p>2. Automated/Proactive eGovernment Sub-group: a first meeting was held on 6 July 2022 to launch a discussion on the topics of automation and proactivity of administrative procedures. Based on concrete life events (birth, death, etc.), the Sub-group decided to analyse the current state of the relevant procedures and the potential benefits of applying the Once-Only principle, as well as to propose trajectories for achieve its implementation. On 24 October 2022, the Sub&#x2011;group met a second time and decided to work in a first phase on the following four life events: birth of a child, death of a close person, application for service checks and creation of a business;</p><p>3. Data Broker Sub-group: the sub-group has the mandate to analyse the integration and implementation of a central data intermediation approach as well as its benefits for the Once-Only principle.

In 2020, the Principality of Monaco announced that the country will opt for hosting a sovereign cloud while Luxembourg will host its digital twin. This will allow Monaco to have at least 120 km between two storage points, thus applying the recommended security standard. The decision to open the Data Embassy was sealed in July 2021, when Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel and the Monegasque Minister of State Pierre Dartout signed an agreement regarding the hosting of Monegasque data and information systems in Luxembourg.

DE4A aims to set up, via a large-scale pilot involving many EU Member States, reusable solutions which make it possible to practically apply the Once-Only principle in the context of cross-border administrative procedures. The effective application of this principle is an essential element in the framework of a policy of administrative simplification and administrative burden reduction. </p><p>The project is important, complex and very ambitious, and, among other things, also aims to help provide the basis for the cross&#x2011;border Once-Only principle procedures that will become mandatory in the coming years under Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 October 2018 establishing a single digital gateway. </p><p>Many meetings were held in 2022.

In 2022, the CTIE expanded its Storage as a Service offer by making the S3 cloud data storage type available to its customers. This recent standard allows applications to back up objects that can include files, images, videos and data, and that can be easily accessed through a web interface or API. It features high scalability, high availability and robust security options.</li></ul><p>Noteworthy, considering that administrations do not operate their own infrastructures, a centralised cloud also fits perfectly into a policy of cost rationalisation and energy savings.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance Computing</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">GovTech</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this filed has been reported to date.</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-980.png" alt="32-980.png" class="keepElement"/></p><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p></div><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/publicservice/Luxembourg" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on Luxembourg&#x2019;s responsible bodies for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-luxembourg">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2>National </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministry for Digitalisation</p><p>Following the general elections on 14 October 2018, Luxembourg&#x2019;s new government created a <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/en.html">Ministry for Digitalisation</a> in charge of all the topics linked to digitalisation and responsible for guaranteeing even higher speed and quality. The Ministry for Digitalisation is a facilitator and coordinator for other Ministries and other partners wishing to develop their activities in the field of digitalisation and eGovernment. Offering more eGovernment services in collaboration with the CTIE is one of the top priorities of the newly created Ministry, in order to foster the modernisation of public administrations, and improve the daily life and administrative processes of citizens and businesses. Assisted by the <a href="https://ctie.gouvernement.lu/en.html">CTIE</a>, the Ministry is also the main body responsible for interoperability activities in Luxembourg.</p><ul><li>In this framework, the Ministry for Digitalisation has set the goal of successfully achieving digital government. The Ministry&#x2019;s <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/en/axes.html">four strategic axes</a> contributing to this goal are the following: (i) developing eGovernment; (ii) advancing administrative reform; (iii) promoting digital inclusion; and (iv) integrating new technologies.</li></ul><p>The specific competences of the Ministry for Digitalisation were defined by the <a href="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/agd/2018/12/05/a1099/jo">Grand Ducal Decree on the Establishment of Ministries</a> on 5 December 2018 and can be summarised as follows:</p><ul><li>Implementation of the Digital Luxembourg Strategy and monitoring of the ICT sector (shared competence with the Minister of Economy, and the Minister for Communications and Media);</li><li>Promotion of the ICT sector (shared competence with the Minister of Economy);</li><li>Digitalisation of administrative procedures and digital transformation of the public administration;</li><li>Follow-up on the work of the High Committee for Digital Transformation;</li><li>Development and implementation of a plan on the Internet of Things;</li><li>Development of the digital infrastructure (in consultation with the Minister for Communications and Media);</li><li>Development of a national strategy in the field of AI (in consultation with the Minister for Communications and Media, and the Minister of Economy);</li><li>Implementation of the national 5G Strategy and development of pilot projects (in consultation with the Minister for Communications and Media);</li><li>Assurance of a policy of digital inclusion;</li><li>Promotion and organisation of State administrations&#x2019; automation, in particular as regards the collection, transmission and processing of data;</li><li>Search for synergies between the different Ministries and optimisation of their exchange of information;</li><li>Assistance to the various administrations of the State in the execution of the routine IT work, and the management of fixed and mobile communication systems; and</li><li>State electronic filing.</li><li>In February 2020, the Ministry for Digitalisation set up an Inter-ministerial Committee for Digitalisation in Public Administration. The committee is chaired by the Ministry for Digitalisation and the CTIE, and includes members responsible for the digital transformation in other Ministries. It meets on a regular basis to take stock of Luxembourg&#x2019;s digital projects and to set a coordinated agenda of initiatives aiming to reinforce eGovernment in Luxembourg.</li></ul><p>Due to the restrictions linked to the Covid pandemic, the second central component of the digital governance structure, the High Committee for Digital transformation, was only established in September 2022. It brings together the various Ministries, representatives of civil society and experts from several backgrounds. By its composition, the High Committee is dedicated to considering the challenges of digitalisation from various perspectives affecting the economy, work, education, health, continuing education or digital public services. Its members meet twice a year to <a href="https://gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2022/09-septembre/28-transformation-numerique-oecd.html">propose, analyse and discuss potential initiatives and projects</a> to advance digital government, while considering the digital inclusion of all citizens.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government IT Centre</p><p>The <a href="https://ctie.gouvernement.lu/en.html">Government IT Centre</a> (<em>Centre des technologies de l&apos;information de l&apos;&#xc9;tat</em>, CTIE) was established in 2009. It constitutes an active part of the Ministry for Digitalisation and is the main administration of the government in the fields of eGovernment, IT and modernisation of the State through ICT.</p><p>More specifically, the CTIE provides service coordination and planning to government bodies, and assists those bodies in the reorganisation and optimisation of their tasks. To this end, the Centre coordinates the following activities: </p><ul><li>Organisation of the automation of government departments regarding the collection, transmission and processing of data; </li><li>Development and maintenance of administrative processes&#x2019; mapping and their interoperability status;</li><li>Provision of organisational support to State administrations and assistance in their reorganisation efforts; and</li><li>Identification of synergies between the various State administrations and optimisation of the information exchange among them. </li></ul><p>The CTIE is also responsible for implementing the provisions that originate directly from the government programme and the eGovernment Strategy. In addition, it is the administrative body responsible for IT services for Luxembourg&#x2019;s government, Ministries and public administrations. It offers a wide range of services to its clients, namely more than 14&#xa0;000 end users in the public administration. These services cover all areas of IT, including network and communication infrastructure, hosting, private cloud (Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS), platforms (Platform as a Service or PaaS), generic and customised software solutions (Software as a Service or SaaS), as well as related services such as secure document generation, individualised mass printing, etc. The CTIE also manages office automation and telephony for Ministries and administrations, and is responsible for implementing and enforcing the State&#x2019;s IT infrastructure security policies.</p><p>Furthermore, the CTIE is responsible for specific tasks, such as the management of the Guichet.lu Portal, the SPOC for citizens and businesses for carrying out public procedures. The portal&#x2019;s interactive MyGuichet.lu platform offers modern and easy-to-use digital services and is a key element of Luxembourg&#x2019;s digital strategy. In addition to a support centre (helpdesk) for the internal and external users of the systems operated by the CTIE, the CTIE also runs the Guichet.lu Helpdesk, whose primary goal is to help citizens and enterprises carry out their administrative procedures. </p><p>The responsibilities for different aspects (legal, operational, semantic or technical) of the main base registries in Luxembourg are partially decentralised to the registry itself and partially centralised to a central organisation. Most of the responsibilities are managed in a decentralised way by each authority in charge of the corresponding registry, and include the operational and legal ownership of the registry, the operational aspects, such as service levels and access formalities, and the decision on semantic levels. Such authorities are, for example, the National Society for Technical Control (SNCT), the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Finance, and the Cadastre and Topography Administration of the State of Luxembourg. In this field, the CTIE enables the digital exchange of information across the public sector. Its responsibilities are, aside from maintaining one specific registry (the RNPP), to provide general support for interoperability between administrations and to devise a broader strategy that drives the evolution of base registries.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministry of State - Department of Media, Connectivity and Digital Policy (SMC)</p><p>The Department of Media, Connectivity and Digital Policy (SMC) of the <a href="https://me.gouvernement.lu/en.html">Ministry of State</a> is responsible for the coordination and development of the national communication infrastructure (national and international connectivity, wired and wireless networks, and data centres) as well as digital policy. The Department is also responsible for:</p><ul><li>The governance and implementation of the national 5G Strategy;</li><li>The governance and implementation of the Strategic Vision for AI;</li><li>The governance and implementation of the Ultra-high Speed Broadband Strategy; and </li><li>The governance and modernisation of the national communication infrastructure for public safety agencies.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministry of Economy</p><p>The <a href="http://www.eco.public.lu/">Ministry of Economy</a> is responsible for creating a business environment that fosters innovation in the IT sector by granting public aid to start-ups, implementing a seed funding and venture capital framework, and simplifying and improving the relationship between IT innovators and the public sector. </p><p>Via Luxinnovation, the national innovation agency under the supervision of the Ministry of Economy, Luxembourg is supporting digital transformation projects, especially those following the Data-Driven Strategy of Luxembourg, which focuses on the use of new IT technologies and collaborative creation of added value. This includes cloud, big data, HPC and AI. </p><p>The agency has updated its strategy to focus its efforts on two major axes: digital and sustainable development. Regarding the digital axis, the agency has set up a new Digital Transformation Department responsible for all digital transformation matters and encompassing the Digital Innovation Hub (DIH), the HPC Competence Centre (HPCCC) and the Gaia-X national hub. This department supports companies in their digital transformation according to their own degree of maturity and their own vision. From conceptual approach to project execution, the Digital Transformation Department supports companies in giving life to their project and work closely with the Research, Development and Innovation (R&amp;D&amp;I) Support Department, where experts translate these ideas and needs into R&amp;D&amp;I projects eligible for the various national and European aid programmes. In 2021, the DIH, focusing on the industry, interacted with over 100 companies with regard to their digital transformation.</p><p>Luxembourg also has a State aid scheme based on the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER) which aims to incentivise companies to undertake innovation and research projects. These go from a simple digitalisation of internal processes, in particular for SMEs, to research projects aimed at developing new processes or products based on business and artificial intelligence. In addition, strategic public-private partnerships (PPPs) are organised to foster cooperation between national research organisations and companies (e.g. PPP Health Tech).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministry of Finance</p><p>The <a href="https://mfin.gouvernement.lu/en.html">Ministry of Finance</a> is responsible for supporting the development of innovative IT tools for the financial sector, such as electronic and/or mobile payment solutions, virtual currencies, and financial data analytics tools and services.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministry of Higher Education and Research</p><p>The <a href="http://www.mesr.public.lu/">Ministry of Higher Education and Research</a> is in charge of promoting eSkills, IT training, and research and development (R&amp;D) programmes in IT.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministry of the Civil Service</p><p>The <a href="https://mfp.gouvernement.lu/en.html">Ministry of the Civil Service</a> is responsible for promoting and assuring:</p><ul><li>An attractive and exemplary public service enabled by performance-oriented, dynamic and highly motivated public officials; and</li><li>A quality public service based on a simple, innovative and effective regulatory framework, which favours social cohesion and the economic prosperity of Luxembourg.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Commission for Data Protection</p><p>The <a href="https://cnpd.public.lu/en.html">National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD)</a>, created in December 2002, is an independent agency whose task is to control the processing of personal data in Luxembourg and to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.</p><h2>Subnational (federal, regional and local)</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Association of Luxembourg&#x2019;s Cities and Communes </p><p>The <a href="http://www.syvicol.lu/">Association of Luxembourg&#x2019;s Cities and Municipalities (Syvicol)</a> is the political representative body of Luxembourg&#x2019;s municipalities.
