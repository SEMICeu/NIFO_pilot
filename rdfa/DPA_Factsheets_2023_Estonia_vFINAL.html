The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Estonia in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Estonia&#x2019;s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Possible areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the alignment of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies with the EIF and the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 &#x2013; Recommendation 14) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Estonian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall very strong performance with scores of 4 in each layer with the exception of the interoperability governance area. More specifically, the score of 3 for Estonia derives from Recommendation 21, stating that countries should put in place defined processes for the selection and adoption of standards and specifications and from Recommendation 23, stating that relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level should be consulted when procuring and developing IT solutions.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Estonia&#x2019;s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with internal and external information sources and services, base registries, open data and catalogues. The implementation of recommendations in the areas of security and privacy have enabled to move from a score of 2 to 3 in 2022. However, there is still room for improvement with security and privacy as well as the conceptual model, where Estonia&#x2019;s score of 3, are below the one of the EU average. More specifically, the use of trust services to ensure secure data exchange in public services (Security and Privacy - Recommendation 47) and the existence of a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components (Conceptual Model &#x2013; Recommendation 35) hinder the overall Estonian score with regard to security and privacy and the conceptual model.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Estonia concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at least upper-middle performance of the country in 16 indicators despite the lack of data of several indicators. However, Estonia has still margin for improvement. For instance, efforts could focus on putting in place processes to select relevant standards and specifications, evaluate them, monitor their implementation, check compliance and test their interoperability (i.e. Interoperability governance -Recommendation 21) and on the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (i.e. Security and Privacy - Recommendation 47).</p><p>Additional information on Estonia&#x2019;s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring" property="dct:relation">interactive dashboards</a><span resource="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring" property="eli:title" content="interactive dashboards"/>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="../html/img/32-450.png" alt="32-450.png" class="keepElement"/></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p></div><div resource="http://example.org/ContactPoint/Estonia" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Joint Declaration on Cooperation for Powering Digital Transformation</p><p>In October 2020, Estonia signed a Joint Declaration of Intent titled<a href="https://toolkit-digitalisierung.de/en/ict-building-blocks-cooperation-digital-transformation/"> &#x2018;Cooperation for Powering Digital Transformation</a>&#x2019;, so as to cooperate in accelerating the digital transformation and digitalisation of public administration for the achievement of the sustainable development goals.

An example in this regard, related to base registries in general and the Once-Only principle in particular, is the Underlying Principle No. 9 of the EIF which concerns administrative simplification. In this field, when the documentation of the databases is coordinated in the Management System of the State Information System (RIHA), the purposefulness of data collection and the compliance with the principle of a single request for data are verified to ensure that the Estonian system complies with the EIF.</p><p>A new interoperability framework is being launched in 2023, replacing a framework that is over ten years old. The new framework will be more of a living document rather than a legislative text, so that it can be edited more frequently.</p><p>The new framework will not be mandatory across the government, and it will rather be a guidance document containing suggested principles. Therefore, the document will provide value to domains where some of the principles would not apply.

First, the previous classification of personal data into three groups (non-sensitive personal data, private personal data and sensitive personal data) was replaced by two data categories, namely &#x2018;personal data&#x2019; and &#x2018;sensitive personal data&#x2019;, with the latter being a sub-class under special protection. Second, all processed personal data are protected and registered by chief processors (i.e. controllers) with the <a href="http://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a>, the data protection supervision authority. Finally, the new PDPA extended all general principles applying to the processing of personal data to the processing of the personal identification code (the unique number assigned to every Estonian citizen and resident). </p><p>From 1&#xa0;January 2015, the Data Protection Inspectorate may submit reports to the Constitutional Committee of the <em>Riigikogu</em> and to the Legal Chancellor concerning significant matters which have an extensive effect or need prompt settlement emerging in the course of supervision over compliance with the act. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">System of Security Measures for Information Systems </p><p>On 1 January 2008, the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/13125331?leiaKehtiv" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">regulation</a><span resource="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/13125331?leiaKehtiv" property="eli:title" content="regulation"/> establishing the system of security measures for information systems used for processing the data contained in State and local government databases and related information assets entered into force.

With this regulation, Estonia adopted a new approach to developing public services: from that moment on, public services must be life event-based and, where possible, proactive. Estonia is currently developing a methodology on how to develop and offer such public services.</p><p>The problem that authorities often face is that they do not have a clear view of their services (as defined in the second article of the regulation). For this reason, the regulation obliges authorities providing public services to maintain an up-to-date list of their own direct public services and of support services provided to other authorities, containing at least significant services. Furthermore, the management of the processes behind the services must have a clear owner. </p><p>The regulation also established a network of coordinators:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.mkm.ee/en">Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications</a> is responsible for the management of direct public services, including determining, sharing and exchanging the information necessary for providing such services;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a> is responsible for organising access to and protection of information; and</li><li>The <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/">Estonian Information System Authority</a> is responsible for the implementation of the requirements applying to the architecture of the State Information System and the key components of the State Information System.</li></ul><p>While executing their tasks, the coordinators have the following functions:</p><ul><li>Planning the main directions for development and the activities supporting such development;</li><li>Issuing guidelines and recommendations;</li><li>Monitoring the implementation of planned activities and the application of guidelines;</li><li>Managing communication;</li><li>Cooperating with other coordinators; and</li><li>Engaging other parties, as necessary.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Regulation on the Cross-Border Exchange of Information Regarding Health Services </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/120112018003" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Regulation on the Cross-border Exchange of Information regarding Health Services</a><span resource="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/120112018003" property="eli:title" content="Regulation on the Cross-border Exchange of Information regarding Health Services"/> came into force in November 2018, aiming to enable people abroad to have better access to medical care and medicines thanks to the electronic exchange of prescription data between countries. Estonia and Finland became the first two countries in Europe to exchange medicine prescription data. Since January 2019, the first EU patients have been able to use digital prescriptions issued by their home doctor when visiting a pharmacy in another EU country: Finnish patients are now able to go to a pharmacy in Estonia and retrieve medicines prescribed electronically by their doctor in Finland. The initiative applies to all ePrescriptions in Finland and to the Estonian pharmacies that have signed the agreement.
