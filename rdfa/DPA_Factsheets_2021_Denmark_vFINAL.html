The Danish government is currently building the strategy around four key themes:</p><ul><li>Management anchoring and competence building: encouraging management based on a thorough understanding, anchoring and prioritisation of cyber and information security; </li><li>Robustness and resilience: increasing the overall competences and knowledge of security issues across all sectors;</li><li>Cooperation and organisation: establishing strong cooperation among authorities and companies in order to promote knowledge sharing and common solutions, as well as increase the ability to respond to major cross-sector incidents; and</li><li>International efforts and contributions: Denmark is expected to partake in international cooperation and contribute to the creation of an open and secure Internet.</li></ul><p>This new national strategy is expected to increase the level of ambition both as regards the efforts of the industry and in relation to the national cross-sectoral commitments. </p><p>The strategy is developed by an inter-ministerial steering group with participation from all ministries. The chairmanship of the steering group is handled by the Danish Agency for Digitisation and the Centre for Cyber Security. Moreover, the National Cyber Security Council and the Business Partnership for Increased IT Security will be involved in order to provide their input to the strategy&apos;s overarching themes and possibly also to specific initiatives.</p><p>In 2017, the Danish government appointed a Tech Ambassador with the aim to strengthen its access to, relations with and influence towards large tech companies across the world.

The <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/human-resources/index_en.htm">Guidelines on How to Make Legislation Digital-Ready</a> in particular outline <a href="http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do">seven principles</a> for digital-ready legislation and how to apply them in the legislative process. </p><p>Additionally, all proposed legislation must be assessed for potential implementation impacts in terms of project risk, organisational changes, data protection and citizens&#x2019; rights. The findings must be documented in the legislative proposal and mitigating measures should be described.</p><p>To ensure that legislation is digital-ready, every legislative proposal is screened for compliance with the guidelines and consultation responses are submitted to the responsible ministries by a unit established within the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>In support of this approach, a <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">course in digital-ready policymaking</a> will be generally available to legislative drafters and policy officers in government departments by the summer of 2021. </p><p>A report documenting the initiatives results was published in May 2021.</p><p>The strategy covered numerous themes related to the digitisation of the public sector, such as automation of public administrative procedures, better user experience for citizens and businesses, digital welfare, data sharing, and others.</p><p>In this context, a new Common Public Sector Digitisation Strategy is to be launched in the near future. The new strategy will set out new ambitious goals for the future development and improvement of digital welfare solutions to the benefit of citizens and businesses, with the aim to use data and new technologies effectively in the fight against climate change and to guarantee better conditions for a more innovative and interconnected public sector, among others.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategy for ICT Management in Central Government</p><p>A <a href="https://en.digst.dk/policy-and-strategy/strategy-for-ict-management/">Strategy for ICT Management in Central Government</a> was launched on 21 November 2017, aiming to improve the operational management of information and communication technology (ICT) systems. The 13 initiatives forming the framework for a better management of ICT systems address issues such as the mandatory compliance to the central government&#x2019;s ICT system portfolio management model and the periodic review by the National ICT Council of each ministry&#x2019;s ICT system management. The initiatives also address the formation of cross-governmental network activities amongst leaders and employees working with digitisation and developing the technical and professional competencies and skills required to manage ICT.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Common Framework for Public-Sector Digital Architecture (Danish NIF)</p><p>In 2017, Danish local, regional and governmental authorities agreed on a common <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/isa/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf"> Federal Digital Architecture</a> (FDA) that focuses on data sharing and cross-organisational processes. The FDA includes a general framework as well as a number of specific architecture assets.</p><p>The core of the FDA framework is constituted of a set of general architecture principles and rules supported by guidelines on architecture description and communication, including common rules for concept and data modelling. Activities such as skill development, architecture guidance and project reviews support the adoption of the common framework. </p><p>The FDA includes a number of concrete architecture assets. This includes reference architectures on common issues such as the sharing of data and documents, user and rights management across domains, coherent user journeys in relation to digital self-services, and user-centric and cross-cutting overview of data relevant to each citizen and enterprise (e.g. in relation to cases, payments, debt, appointments and deadlines). </p><p>Finally, the FDA encompasses a number of common technical solutions such as the national infrastructure solutions for ID, Digital Signature, Single Sign On and Digital Post, among others.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isa2programme">general governance structure</a> is based on voluntary use depending on relevance, logic and business case. Some elements, such as digital signature and digital post, are required by law. Projects falling within the common public sector strategies shall take the FDA into account and undergo a FDA architecture-review. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Rules for Concept and Data Modelling</p><p>It is important that authorities and businesses are able to retrieve, understand and use data originating from other authorities. Therefore, the Common Public-Sector Digital Architecture recommends applying the <a href="https://digst.dk/it-loesninger/eid-gateway/">Rules for Concept and Data Modelling</a> to document concepts and data. The rules ensure that concepts and data are described and documented thoroughly, correctly and consistently whilst reusing national and international models, standards and experiences to the extent possible. </p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Government Partnership Action Plan (2019&#x2013;2021)</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/EU_ISA2">Open Government Partnership</a>, an international collaboration, the Danish government drafted a fourth <a href="https://twitter.com/Joinup_eu" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">National Action Plan (2019&#x2013;2021)</a><span resource="https://twitter.com/Joinup_eu" property="dct:title" content="National Action Plan (2019&#x2013;2021)"/> containing seven initiatives from various parts of the Danish public sector.</p><p>The Action Plan aims to strengthen trust and transparency in public authorities, especially in public digitisation.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">NOBID Project</p><p>The NOBID Project has been extended until the end of 2024 and has become a sub-project under the Cross-Border Digital Service (CBDS) Programme.

As a result of the strategy, regions are now investing in developing and replacing electronic health record systems and municipalities are radically changing the way they use health data by implementing structured electronic medical records.</p><p>In this way, the Digital Health Strategy lays the groundwork for a joint digitisation effort for the entire Danish health system. By strengthening the common digital foundation for the provision of healthcare across the sector, the strategy also aims to maintain and reinforce the security of personal health data and to enable the safe and secure exchange of relevant data across the health sector.</p><h2>Emerging Technologies</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Artificial Intelligence</p><ul><li><a href="mailto:evm@evm.dk#page=27">A responsible foundation for AI</a>;</li><li><a href="https://www.borger.dk/internet-og-sikkerhed/Digital-Post/Post#page=35">More and better data</a>;</li><li>St<a href="https://digst.dk/media/16165/ds_singlepage_uk_web.pdf#page=45">rong competences and new knowledge</a>; and</li><li><a href="https://eng.em.dk/media/13081/305755-gb-version_4k.pdf#page=53">Increased investment in AI</a>.</li></ul><p>Noteworthy initiatives are the presentation of six ethical principles for the use of AI, a better access to public data as well as the development of a common Danish language resource to support and accelerate the development of language-technology solutions in Danish. </p><p/><p><img src="../html/img/35-396.jpeg" alt="35-396.jpeg" class="keepElement"/></p><p>	 Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><p>4</p><p>	</p><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/legalframework/Denmark" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2>Specific Legislation on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Standing Committee for the Legal Framework on eGovernment</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://en.digst.dk/policy-and-strategy/digital-strategy/">Digital Strategy 2016&#x2212;2020</a>, presented by the former government, a Standing Committee was set up to create a clear legal framework for eGovernment.

More data will be constantly made available on the Data Distributor.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Reference Architecture for Sharing Data and Documents</p><ul><li>Transmission on request: typically, system-to-system integrations using an API; and</li><li>Transmission by message: typically, the legally binding communication of data (possibly in the form of documents) from public authorities to citizens and businesses, but also a classical pattern in system-to-system integrations.</li></ul><p>The fundamental difference between these two scenarios is, whether it is the actor transmitting data or the actor receiving data, who is responsible for the concrete data process flow.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">New Application Profiles</p><p>A Danish application profile of version 2.0 of the <a href="https://www.regioner.dk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="dcat application profile" resource="https://www.regioner.dk/">DCAT Application Profile</a> for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP) has been completed and approved for use in the context of the Danish public sector (DCAT-AP-DK). </p><p>Furthermore, to support higher reuse and quality of metadata about IT systems, two application profiles have been established: a Basic Application Profile describing the core properties of public sector IT systems and an Archive Application Profile extending the basic profile elements relevant to the submission of information about IT systems to the National Archives.</p><p>In addition, a method for describing Dataset Quality has been established. The method has been developed on the basis of international standards such as the W3C Data on the Web Best Practices, including the Data Quality Vocabulary, and ISO 25012 on Data Quality.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">NemID Digital Signature</p><p>Since 1&#xa0;July 2010, <a href="https://en.digst.dk/data-and-it-architecture/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="nemid" resource="https://en.digst.dk/data-and-it-architecture/">NemID</a>, the national digital signature, has provided easy and safe access to a wide range of public and private self-service solutions on the web, including eBanking, tax forms, insurance and pension funds. With this digital signature, citizens use the same user ID and the same password for online banking, government websites and a wide range of private services online. NemID is the result of the collaboration between the state, municipalities and regions, the financial sector, and a private contractor. More than 5.2 million personal NemIDs have been issued to citizens from the age of 15 and up. In addition, NemID can now be used by business-owners in more than half a million companies as a way to log in to digital self-service solutions (for example <a href="https://ast.dk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="virk" resource="https://ast.dk/">Virk</a> and <a href="http://www.datatilsynet.dk/english/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="digital post" resource="http://www.datatilsynet.dk/english/">Digital Post</a>) on behalf of the business entity, making reporting to the public sector easier, especially for SMEs. Previously, a NemID Employee Certificate was the only electronic key to digital self-service solutions.</p><p>In cooperation with the <a href="https://datafordeler.dk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="danish association of the blind" resource="https://datafordeler.dk/">Danish Association of the Blind</a>, a special solution was also developed for blind and partially sighted people.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eIDAS eID-Gateway Node</p><p>Work is also progressing to support the national implementation of the Single Digital Gateway and to prepare for the integration of Danish eServices into the national eID-infrastructure. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">NemLog-in: Sign-In Solution</p><p>NemLog-in is a vital part of the public infrastructure and is the primary joint identity broker/identity provider solution. It also serves as integration point for public IT service providers and self-service solutions.</p><p>NemLog-in consists of a number of components that make up the Danish national platform for login and user access management. Established in 2008, NemLog-in is today in its third generation with over 150 IT service providers. It offers 500 self-service solutions and records more than a 100 million logins a year. One of the primary components is a login/authentication service with Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality. Citizens, employees in companies and authorities can log on to public self-services solutions and portals. Other NemLog-in components include central user access management, a signing service (incl. signature validation and possibly long-term storage), a power of attorney functionality and a Security Token Service (STS) functionality. Lastly, NemLog-in provides an administration component, where IT service providers and IT vendors can maintain their self-service solution integrations to NemLog-in.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Procurement Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.udbudsportalen.dk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="procurement portal" resource="http://www.udbudsportalen.dk/">Procurement Portal</a> offers public and private providers guidance on the knowledge and tools necessary for the provision of tendering services. The purpose of the Portal is to facilitate cooperation between enterprises and the public sector as a means to promote public services efficiently. Furthermore, some regional and local authorities make use of private marketplaces. The State-owned company <a href="http://www.ski.dk" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="national procurement ltd (ski)" resource="http://www.ski.dk">National Procurement Ltd (SKI)</a> has set up simpler eTendering solutions systems (<em><a href="https://www.ethics.dk/ethics/eo" /l "/SKI/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="netindk&#xf8;b" resource="https://www.ethics.dk/ethics/eo" \l "/SKI/">NetIndk&#xf8;b</a></em> <em>&amp;</em> <em>Netkatalog</em>).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><em>Nemhandel</em></p><p><em>Nemhandel</em> is an open network with its own document standards, making eProcurement between suppliers of goods and public authorities and institutions easy, secure and efficient. <em>Nemhandel</em> functions as one common standard for eProcurement and makes it possible for all businesses to connect once and reach all - irrespective of the purchasing system or the IT service provider.</p><p><em>Nemhandel</em> has continuously and actively participated in European and international cooperation for e-procurement. In 2017, <em>Nemhandel</em> began to be integrated into Peppol, and in the years 2019 and 2020, it became mandatory for all public authorities to be affiliated to the Peppol network, via the <em>Nemhandel</em> Registry, which is also a Peppol registry. From January 2023, Peppol-based eCatalogues and eOrders will also be mandatory for public entities for certain categories of goods and services.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Driving License App (<em>K&#xf8;rekort-appen</em>) and Digital Health Card</p><p>Since 24 November 2020, Danish citizens have been able to download their driving license in a new app and leave their physical driving license at home.</p><p>With more than 500&#xa0;000 downloads of the new app in the 24 hours after its release, almost 750&#xa0;000 in the first week, and now over 1 million, Danish citizens have quickly adopted the new digital driving license.</p><p>Citizens who wish to subscribe to the app must possess a Danish driving licences, a NemID (the official digital signature (eID) for public digital services) and a Danish passport. Users simply log in with their eID and scan their passport in order to download the passport photo to their driving license app. </p><p>The app has a built-in QR-code that enables the Danish police to use their dedicated app to confirm the digital driving license validity without touching the driver&apos;s phone. The app also displays a secondary QR-code with less information, which can be used as proof of identity, for instance to buy age-restricted products or pick up a parcel at the post office. The digital driving license app is only valid within the Danish borders.</p><p>Neither the digital driving license app nor the Digital Health Card will replace the physical ID-cards. Physical driving licenses will still be assigned upon passing the driving test, and the health insurance card will also be issued physically. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Corona Passport</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">NemKonto</p><p>Most Danish citizens and companies occasionally receive payments from the public sector. These payments can be TAX or VAT refunds, child subsidies, pensions, student loans, unemployment benefits, housing support or social welfare payments etc. All payments from public institutions will be transferred directly to what is called a NemKonto account. </p><p>All citizens and companies registered in Demark are required to have a NemKonto. A NemKonto is a normal bank account that you assign as your NemKonto. Some private enterprises such as insurance and pension companies, are also able to make payments to a NemKonto as well. </p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Information Repository and Platform for Collaboration</p><p><a href="https://indberet.virk.dk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="arkitektur.digst.dk" resource="https://indberet.virk.dk/">Arkitektur.digst.dk</a> is the central repository for shared public reference architecture models, data standards and general advice developed to support work on architectures in the digitisation of public authorities. The site is developed by the central government and local government authorities in cooperation. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Danish catalogue of datasets</p><p>A <a href="http://www.boligejer.dk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="dataset catalogue" resource="http://www.boligejer.dk/">dataset catalogue</a> has been established as a web-based platform by the <a href="https://www.digitaliser.dk/services" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="agency for digitisation" resource="https://www.digitaliser.dk/services">Agency for Digitisation</a>. The purpose of the platform is to make it easy for authorities to describe their datasets in a consistent manner while also providing an overview of public sector datasets. </p><p>At the moment, the platform only provides an overview of a minority of the public datasets. A continued effort was  established in the fall 2020 to ensure that more public datasets are presented on the platform. The platform guides data users to access public datasets through a direct link to the dataset or to a landing page. The platform does not distribute the datasets, but provides metadata about the datasets. In addition, where possible, the Catalogue provides contact information so that data users can contact data custodians for additional information, if needed.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Danish Catalogue of Data Distributors</p><p>Because of the parallel development of a Danish digital public sector, many agencies and ministries need to share specialised data, which has resulted in a diverse and specialised ecosystem of dedicated data distributors that allows for citizens, businesses and public organisations to access public resources. In the data distributor catalogue, interested parties can now find the access points for 18 of the most prominent data distributors. The list grows as data distribution becomes increasingly professionalised in more public organisations, which are growing aware of their role as data distributors.</p><h2>Cross-Border Platforms</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Cloud Services and CEF eDelivery Services</p><p>Work is currently being undertaken to support the public sector use of cloud offerings, including the guidance on the use of cloud services published in November 2019 and the provision of various cloud offerings to government bodies serviced by the Agency for Governmental IT Services.</p><p>CEF eDelivery is implemented to support various cross-border domain solutions such as eInvoicing and Business Register Interconnected Systems and it is also expected to be used for the Single Digital Gateway Once Only Technical System.</p><p>The TESTA network is used for a number of cross-border use cases.</p><h2>Base Registries</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Base Registry Data available on the Data Distributor </p><p>The Danish Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency is responsible for cross-public coordination of base registry data and it is also responsible for the Data Distributor.
