For example, by 31 July 2018 the number of institutions integrated into the eGovernment Gateway was 460, the number of services provided 3&#xa0;370 and the number of eGovernment users 38&#xa0;711 601; but as of 14 April 2021, the number of integrated institutions was 791, the number of services provided 5&#xa0;749 and the number of users 54&#xa0;213&#xa0;270. </p><p>In addition, while at the end of 2019 the number of accesses to the eGovernment Gateway was 1&#xa0;179&#xa0;624&#xa0;439, at the end of 2020 it totalled 2&#xa0;305&#xa0;790&#xa0;643. The main reason for this considerable increase was the rise in the burden on the eGovernment Gateway during the pandemic period, as many important services were transferred to the digital environment in order to provide public services 24/7 without interruption. </p><p>Especially during the COVID-19 outbreak, coordination was ensured by the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency for the transfer of the most needed public services to the eGovernment Gateway in order to provide continuity of the following services:</p><ul><li>pandemic social support pre-application;</li><li>restructuring of social security debts;</li><li>Life Fits Home Code generation and request;</li><li>COVID-19 vaccination status inquiry and appointment;</li><li>travel permit application; and</li><li>loss of income, rental and turnover support applications for enterprises.</li></ul><p>Efforts to improve the benefits from the eGovernment Gateway for disadvantaged citizens were continued during the pandemic period and eGovernment Gateway access passwords started to be delivered to citizens over the age of 65 to their residential address. In this way, it was ensured that the individuals in question were able to benefit from many digital services, as well as get their appointments for the COVID&#x2011;19 vaccine through the eGovernment Gateway, like many other citizens. In addition, the access page can be transformed into a format allowing disabled citizens to make transactions.</p><p>To ensure accessibility and user-friendliness, the eGovernment Gateway is also accessible through the barrier-free eGovernment Gateway call centre. The call centre, specifically designed for disabled people, started to operate for eGovernment-related requests in 2018.

Judges, prosecutors and lawyers can access all cases in Turkish courts online, provided that online approval has been granted by the judges dealing with the case.</p><p>Moreover, citizens can reach and check the information pertaining to their case through the internet via the Citizen Portal of the UYAP and be informed of the date fixed for the trial or hearing via a website, without appearing in court. Citizens can also submit their claims to court by using their electronic signature and examine their files through the internet. Furthermore, via the Lawyer Portal lawyers can file a suit, submit any document to courts and pay case fees from their office through the internet, by using their electronic signature. Via the UYAP, lawyers can also litigate a claim or dispute and review their cases through electronic means, and submit their petitions online. Also, private and public institutions pursue their own related cases via the Institutional Portal, while experts working for any court can get information about their cases from their home or offices without going to court through the Expert Portal. In addition, all UYAP users can access technical or personal training through the independent and non-spatial eLearning Portal.

That way, an institution requiring data from other institutions benefits from a secure and single connection to the eGovernment Gateway, without having to connect with each institution one by one. The eGovernment Gateway consists of a <a href="https://kamu.turkiye.gov.tr/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="web-based application" resource="https://kamu.turkiye.gov.tr/">web-based application</a> and a service-based application. The web-based application, working on the <a href="https://kamu.turkiye.gov.tr/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="public" resource="https://kamu.turkiye.gov.tr/">Public</a> Application Centre, provides a mechanism enabling civil servants to see only the information permitted within the authorisation given by the related public institution. With the service-based application, institutions can share data with each other without requiring any authorisation within specified rules. For example, by using the Public Service Platform (PSP, <em>Kamu Uygulamalar&#x131; Merkezi</em>), universities can check the military service status (information provided by Ministry of Defence) of the students online by utilising the national ID numbers of the students.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Identity Information Sharing System</p><p>The <a href="https://kpsbasvuru.nvi.gov.tr/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="identity information sharing system (kps)" resource="https://kpsbasvuru.nvi.gov.tr/">Identity Information Sharing System (KPS)</a> went into operation in 2005 as an extension of the Central Population Management System (MERNIS). Public institutions and agencies can access ID information stored in the MERNIS database via the KPS under the conditions strictly specified in the respective access protocols. In order for agencies to benefit from the KPS, an agreement must first be concluded with the General Directorate of Civil Registration and Nationality. The KPS works over a VPN and every user is assigned a username and password. The system keeps logs of every user and every conducted enquiry.</p><p>The KPS offers the following enquiry services: </p><ul><li>web sites;</li><li>enquiry about personal information using the Turkish Republic Identity Number (TR Identity Number); </li><li>enquiry about the TR Identity Number using personal information; </li><li>enquiry about identity information based on information on the place of registration; </li><li>request of a copy of the civil status records using various criteria; and </li><li>web services (XML infrastructure). </li></ul><p>Users of the system are able to conduct enquiries by accessing the KPS web services using add-ons to their existing applications or by developing new applications, and then view the enquired data directly from their own applications and automatically update their own databases with the enquired information. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Identity Management System Application</p><p>An identification verification system consisting of a user ID and a password is used in the framework of the eGovernment services provided by government agencies, with each agency producing its own IDs and passwords. Some government agencies meet their identification verification needs using the eSignature and mobile signature.

The KEC is a special card reader whose infrastructure was developed by T&#xdc;B&#x130;TAK B&#x130;LGEM for the new generation of electronic ID cards. Thanks to the Secure Access Module (GEM) inside the device, it can communicate securely with the ID card and read data fields that cannot be reached with standard card readers, such as the personal message and biometric data of the card holder. The KEC performs the verification with authentication methods according to the security policy determined by the external application software or policy server. Within the scope of the EKDS, an eSignature can be uploaded to the Turkish ID card thanks to the card&#x2019;s features. </p><p>The EKDS Regulation was published in the Official Gazette No.&#xa0;31282 dated 22 October 2020. Within the scope of this regulation, the infrastructure system for EKDS management was established by the Software Division of the DGCRC. The DGCRC aims to expand the use of the EKDS and the Turkish ID card eSignature feature in 2021.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Biometric Data Management System</p><p>Fingerprint data is taken from citizens for passport, driving license and Turkish ID Card applications received through MERN&#x130;S and this data is transferred to MERN&#x130;S through a programme. If the citizen&#x2019;s fingerprint was previously provided for another instance within the system, the relevant intermediary programme verifies the fingerprint data. If the citizen does not have a previous fingerprint in the system, the programme takes the fingerprint record and shares it with the security units, and 1-N checks whether it matches with that of another citizen. </p><p>Due to the fact that the related intermediary programme works outside of MERNIS and the software was not developed by the DGCRC, as well as to disruptions in control processes and problems in sharing data with security units, the DGCRC developed a fingerprint acquisition and comparison software in cooperation with Havelsan in accordance with the 11<sup>th</sup> Development Plan.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Photograph Comparison System</p><p>Photographs of citizens taken in the last six months are demanded for passport, driving license and Turkish ID Card applications received through MERN&#x130;S. These photos are stored within the DGCRC&#x2019;s database. A software which compares the new photograph submitted by the citizen at the time of the application with the photographs of the old applications in the system and verifies whether the person is the person in the new photograph, with an accuracy rate of 99.7%, was developed by the DGCRC&#x2019;s Software Division. With this software, the aim is to prevent situations such as the need to detect citizens who have been the target of forgery but are not aware of it, the accepting of wrong photographs by personnel receiving applications and the issuance of documents on behalf of a different citizen.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Instant Messaging System </p><p>An Instant Messaging System (<em>N&#xfc;fus ve Vatanda&#x15f;l&#x131;k I&#x15f;leri Genel M&#xfc;d&#xfc;rl&#xfc;&#x11f;&#xfc; &#x130;leti Sistemi</em>) was developed by the DGCRC&#x2019;s Information Technologies Department in accordance with the Instant Messaging Security measure in the Information and Communication Security Guide published by the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency on 24 July 2020. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Turkish National Electronic Identity Card </p><p>The Turkish National Electronic Identity Card is used by law as citizenship card in lieu of the birth certificate.

Thanks to the EEP, all information necessary for Turkish exporters is provided by a single platform and presented within a new ecosystem in a user-friendly format. In the platform, up-to-date data and information obtained from public and paid databases, such as the UN Comtrade, the databases of the World Bank and Euromonitor, as well as data kept by various General Directorates of the competent Ministry, are constantly and automatically available on the relevant pages. </p><p>While providing a wide range of information through a single channel, the EEP provides consultancy to Turkish exporters as to the market selection by using disruptive technologies such as machine learning algorithms. The Smart Export Robot, one of the most important modules of the platform, operates in four layers using more than 10 million lines of data for more than 10&#xa0;000 data fields compiled from national and international sources, together with the export history of companies. The Smart Export Robot then provides target market recommendations to companies by calculating a score for each country. The users also have the flexibility to rank the target markets recommended according to their own preferences. </p><p>The platform also promotes product diversification by using micro import and export data. By using association rules similar to the recommendation systems in eCommerce platforms, the EEP suggests the most suitable alternative products to diversify export portfolios. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Foreigners Communication Centre (YIMER 157)&#xa0;</p><p>A Speech Analytics and Interactive Voice Response System will be integrated into Y&#x130;MER 157 in 2021.
