Developing eGovernment;</li><li>2. Advancing the administrative reform;</li><li>3. Promoting digital inclusion; and</li><li>4. Integrating new technologies.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eGovernance Strategy 2021&#x2013;2025</p><p>In February 2021, the Government Council adopted the <a href="https://ctie.gouvernement.lu/fr/publications/2021/strategie-gouvernance-electronique-2021-2025.html">eGovernance Strategy</a> for 2021&#x2013;2025, jointly developed by the Ministry for Digitalisation and the Government IT Centre (<em>Centre des technologies de l&apos;information de l&apos;&#xc9;tat</em>, CTIE). The Governing Council also mandated the Inter-ministerial Committee for Digitalisation to coordinate the implementation of this strategy.</p><p>One of the strategic axes of the Ministry for Digitalisation aims to strengthen eGovernment and enable the transition to a digital government, a concept which designates the use of technologies within the framework of State modernisation strategies with the objective of creating real added value for citizens, businesses and public administrations.</p><p>The eGovernance Strategy forms part of this approach by setting the essential elements for a successful digital transition of the State in order to ensure quality digital services and to guarantee a gradual transition to a digital government, as recommended by international organisations.</p><p>The 2021&#x2013;2025 strategy highlights the principles to be respected when digitising public services in order to offer citizens and businesses public services that meet their needs. The goal is promoting transversal digital accessibility, developing user-centred services, offering attractive online public services and investing in citizens&#x2019; trust in online State services.</p><p>Furthermore, the strategy analyses the essential conditions for the central public administration so as to enable it to respond effectively to the needs of society. The overarching objectives in the digital context are to facilitate the transition to an efficient paperless administration and to have an information technology (IT) environment conducive to new ways of working. </p><p>Finally, the strategy underlines the importance of being able to rely on a central IT partner who is competent, agile and reliable. To this aim, the CTIE aims to strengthen its digitalisation services, develop cutting-edge infrastructures and further guarantee very high levels of security and reliability.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Einfach L&#xeb;tzebuerg</p><p>The government has been committed to administrative reform and simplification for several years now and much progress has already been made, notably under the programme <a href="https://fonction-publique.public.lu/fr/plus/actualites/articles-actualites/2017/04/20170403_Einfach-Letzebuerg.html"><em>Einfach L&#xeb;tzebuerg</em></a>. </p><p>However, the simplification of administrative formalities and procedures is continually evolving. Drawing on technological advances in particular, the programme aims to provide a simple and predictable framework for citizens and companies in their relations with the State. Any new project, legislation, procedure or adaptation of existing ones, when deemed necessary, needs to be respectively considered or reconsidered in light of the &#x2018;digital&#x2019; component.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategic Vision for Artificial Intelligence </p><ul><li>Becoming one of the most digitally advanced societies in the world, in particular within the European Union (EU);</li><li>Establishing Luxembourg as a sustainable, data-driven economy; and</li><li>Supporting the development of AI with a human-centred approach.</li></ul><p>On 20 November 2020, the government undertook an additional step in the pursuing of the national Strategic Vision for AI by launching a public consultation on the perception of AI among the population and societal actors. The results of the consultation were presented by Prime Minister Xavier Bettel in spring 2021.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>On 8 December 2020, the Minister Delegate for Digitalisation signed the <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites.gouvernement+fr+actualites+toutes_actualites+communiques+2020+12-decembre+08-berlin-hansen.html">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>.

The act&#x2019;s primary importance resides in the recognition of eSignatures and eContracts. Unlike the directive it was based on, it does not use the term &#x2018;advanced&#x2019; eSignature but rather recognises a &#x2018;qualified&#x2019; level of eSignature. It also differs from the directive and similar legislation in other Member States insofar as it legally recognises electronic wills and electronic deeds, and implements the customer&#x2019;s right to withdraw from an electronic contract within seven days of its creation, free of questions and penalties, with full reimbursement of any money paid to the seller. Differently, the act closely follows the directive in terms of information requirements from seller to customer, the seller&#x2019;s obligation to acknowledge reception of an order, the rules governing the liability and confidentiality requirements for certificate issuers (domestic and foreign), and provisions concerning the auditing and accreditation of certificate issuers.</p><p>More in detail, the eCommerce Act explicitly mentions two types of eSignatures: (i) a basic type, which consists of a &#x201c;set of data which is linked to the deed in a non-dissociable way and warrants the integrity of the deed&#x201d;, and &#x201c;must also ensure the signatory is identified and show the latter&#x2019;s obvious consent to the content of the deed&#x201d;; and (ii) an eSignature &#x201c;supported by a qualified certificate, which must be created with a secure signature creation device under the sole control of the subscriber&#x201d;. eSignatures supported by a qualified certificate have the same legal validity as handwritten signatures, and the eCommerce Act rendered void all laws and regulations that challenged the validity of a contract on the grounds that it was signed electronically.</p><p>Certification service providers can only issue certificates with the approval of the National Accreditation and Supervision Authority. Approved (qualified) certificates are valid for a maximum duration of three years and must be archived by the certification service provider for at least ten years. The certification providers also have to undergo periodic external security audits.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">EU General Data Protection Regulation </p><p>In May 2018, the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a><span resource="https://gdpr.eu/" property="eli:title" content="EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)"/> entered into force in the whole EU and therefore also in <a href="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2018/08/01/a686/jo">Luxembourg</a>.

Regarding the digital axis, the agency has set up a new Digital Transformation Department responsible for all digital transformation matters and encompassing the Digital Innovation Hub (DIH), the HPC Competence Centre (HPCCC) and the Gaia-X national hub. This department supports companies in their digital transformation according to their own degree of maturity and their own vision. From conceptual approach to project execution, the Digital Transformation Department supports companies in giving life to their project and work closely with the research, development and innovation (R&amp;D&amp;I) support department, where experts translate these ideas and needs with clients into R&amp;D&amp;I projects eligible for the various national and European aid programmes. The DIH, focusing on the industry, has been interacting with over 100 companies in their digital transformation in 2021.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministry of Finance</p><p>The <a href="https://mfin.gouvernement.lu/en.html">Ministry of Finance</a> is responsible for supporting the development of innovative IT tools for the financial sector, such as electronic and/or mobile payment solutions, virtual currencies, and financial data analytics tools and services.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministry of Higher Education and Research</p><p>The <a href="http://www.mesr.public.lu/">Ministry of Higher Education and Research</a> is in charge of promoting eSkills, IT training, and research and development (R&amp;D) programmes in IT.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministry of the Civil Service</p><p>The <a href="https://mfp.gouvernement.lu/en.html">Ministry of the Civil Service</a> is responsible for promoting and assuring:</p><ul><li>An attractive and exemplary public service enabled by performance-oriented, dynamic and highly motivated public officials; and</li><li>A quality public service based on a simple, innovative and effective regulatory framework, which favours social cohesion and the economic prosperity of Luxembourg.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Commission for Data Protection</p><h2>Subnational (federal, regional and local)</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Inter-Communal IT Management Association </p><p>The SIGI project management office&#x2019;s role is to take charge of the new demands of different actors and to formalise them in a portfolio of projects before proceeding with their planning and execution.</p><p>The application of methodological standards, in a structured framework and with experienced staff, guarantees the implementation of quality solutions.</p><p>Support is a key element of the service offered by SIGI, which includes incident management and change management.

In 2021, the Ministry for Digitalisation also set up SpeedUP, a faster way to launch calls for solutions more precisely for smaller-scale projects, or conceptual or juridical analysis. With a maximum of eight months from the launch of the call to the implementation of the solution, the SpeedUP procedure enables the Ministry to accelerate the identification of appropriate solutions as well as their integration.</p><p>In early 2022, the Ministry for Digitalisation has also introduced a new collaborative platform enabling State agents to actively participate in the digitalisation of public services. This platform is based on a co-creative approach, and seeks ideas and proposals from State agents through the launch of calls for challenges issued by Ministries. The input collected through the platform will be transformed into calls for solutions by the GovTech Lab in the form of innovation partnerships or SpeedUPs, or into regular projects by the CTIE.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">luxembourg.lu</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Guichet.lu</p><p>Guichet.lu comprises information on various topics and related administrative procedures, grouped by ten major themes for citizens and ten major themes for companies. The platform is regularly updated with new elements, as in the case of the changes to procedures following Brexit in 2020.  </p><p>The portal&#x2019;s primary objective is to improve<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>value<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>quality<strong> </strong>of eServices, integrating various administrative formalities on a single internet portal that gathers all relevant procedures, forms and information made available by the State. With an offer for its functionalities that is constantly growing, the interactive portal MyGuichet.lu allows its users to: </p><ul><li>Carry out administrative procedures in a simple and transparent manner reusing their personal data from authentic sources;</li><li>View their personal data held by official bodies through authentic sources, e.g. information on obtained housing aid;</li><li>Receive electronic documents issued by official bodies (eDelivery); and</li><li>Book an appointment online with administrative bodies, a key functionality through the Covid-19 pandemic (for appointment booking for large scale testing and vaccination).</li><li>In order to make full use of the different functionalities, such as authentic sources and eDelivery, users have to log in to their personal space with an electronic authentication certificate (<a href="https://www.luxtrust.com/trust-services/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="luxtrust token" resource="https://www.luxtrust.com/trust-services/">LuxTrust Token</a>, Smartcard, Signing Stick or ID Card). These certificates guarantee highly secure information exchanges and personal data confidentiality along with an eSignature.</li></ul><p>The CTIE has started a project to integrate a new low code platform in the CTIE infrastructure. This will facilitate the transformation of PDF forms into true webforms that can easily be submitted through MyGuichet.lu (with better user experience and better accessibility). Furthermore, throughout 2020 and 2021, 18 descriptive factsheets on administrative procedures were published in plain language (<em>Leichte Sprache</em>) on the Guichet.lu information portal, with the aim to help people with limited reading and writing skills to navigate and get information through the portal.</p><p>In July 2021, the CTIE also <a href="https://guichet.public.lu/fr/actualites/2021/juillet/05-app-myguichet.html" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="published" resource="https://guichet.public.lu/fr/actualites/2021/juillet/05-app-myguichet.html">published</a> the new mobile app MyGuichet.lu so that users can access digital public services directly on their smartphone. The app allows citizens to consult the documents sent to them electronically by administrations via eDelivery, carry out different administrative procedures online, book an appointment (for example for Covid-19 vaccination) and see data presented in authentic sources. A key feature of the new app is the possibility for citizens to download &#x2013; at any time &#x2013; a copy of their own or their childrens&#x2019; EU Digital Covid Certificates. </p><p>The eGovernance Strategy 2021&#x2013;2025 mentioned in Section 3.1, drawn up jointly by the Ministry for Digitalisation and the CTIE, and the related roadmap established by the Inter-ministerial Committee for Digitalisation, imply that the CTIE as well as the public administrations undertake measures on the front-end level (i.e. the interfaces of the online public services that face the citizens/companies) and back-end level (i.e. the applications that allow government entities to process the citizens&#x2019; requests) in line with the principles of &#x2018;digital by default&#x2019;, &#x2018;Once-Only&#x2019;, &#x2018;inclusion and accessibility&#x2019;, &#x2018;openness and transparency&#x2019;, &#x2018;reliability and security&#x2019; as well as &#x2018;interoperability and standardisation&#x2019;. With regard to the back-end level, since 2013 the generic back office for MyGuichet.lu is the administration counterpart of MyGuichet.lu and allows governmental bodies that do not have a specific back-office application to receive procedures transmitted by MyGuichet.lu. This is an accelerator for the digitalisation of procedures because no specific back office needs to be developed. Also, there are considerations to modify the national legislation in order to allow a digital signature on administrative acts. This will ensure that a governmental body can digitally sign administrative decisions and return them digitally to the applicant, allowing to enlarge the offer of end-to-end digital procedures to citizens and companies. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">etat.public.lu</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">gouvernement.lu</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">legilux.lu</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">data.public.lu</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">sante.lu</p><p><a href="http://www.sante.public.lu/fr/index.php" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="sante.lu " resource="http://www.sante.public.lu/fr/index.php">sante.lu </a>is the official portal for all health-related topics.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">transports.public.lu and mobiliteit.lu</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">justice.lu</p><p><a href="http://www.justice.public.lu/fr/index.html" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="justice.lu " resource="http://www.justice.public.lu/fr/index.html">justice.lu </a>is the official portal of the courts and of the judicial system for all topics related to the judiciary.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">chd.lu</p><p><a href="http://chd.lu/wps/portal/public/Accueil/Actualite" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="chd.lu " resource="http://chd.lu/wps/portal/public/Accueil/Actualite">chd.lu </a>is the Parliament&#x2019;s website.
