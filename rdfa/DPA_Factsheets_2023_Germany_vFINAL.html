The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Germany in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Germany&#x2019;s results in Scoreboard 1 show an imbalanced level of implementation of the EIF Principles. Indeed, for the two Principles that were analysed (Principles 9 and 10) the results show a good implementation, with scores of four for Principle 10 (Administrative simplification) and three for Principle 9 (Multilingualism), in alignment with the EU average. Nonetheless, the lack of data for all the other Principles does not allow to have a good overall picture of the level of implementation of the EIF Principles in Germany. </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The German results for the implementation of interoperability layers are also incomplete due to an absence of data in all the areas of Scoreboard 2. However, Germany has a very good implementation of recommendations relating to interoperability governance and semantic interoperability. A potential area of improvement is Recommendation 22 (KPI 42), with a score of one. To have a better performance on this recommendation, Germany should aim at better managing ICT standards and specifications to ensure interoperability.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Germany&#x2019;s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show, as for the other scoreboards, a very incomplete picture.

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>Federal Digital Strategy</p><p>In August 2022, the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) published its new Federal Digital Strategy <em>(Digitalstrategie der Bundesregierung)</em>.The strategy succeeds the implementation of the Shaping Digitalisation (<em>Digitalisierung gestalten</em>) strategy of the previous administration. It serves as a guidebook for all digital policies and digitalisation strategies of the Federal ministries for the current legislative period. It defines ambitious and measurable goals the Federal Government wants to reach. The strategy also defines three key projects, which are the prerequisite to boost digital transformation:  </p><ul><li>Network rollout as well as improved and standardized provision of data; </li><li>Providing digital identities, not only for the use of public administration services; and</li><li>Creating uniform framework conditions and standards to allow the highest degree of interoperability.</li></ul><p>These projects are essential for every digital policy measure planned and implemented by the ministries in their own responsibility. Progress is measured by a three-pillared monitoring process comprised of both quantitative and qualitative elements. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Third National Action Plan within the Open Government Partnership</p><p>In the framework of its participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP), Germany develops national action plans on open government every two years, in accordance with the OGP rules and guidelines. They are the product of a co-creation process between government and civil society resulting in relevant commitments to foster transparency, participation, accountability and other elements of government openness. The German federal government submitted a third National Action Plan (NAP) in the summer of 2021 after a public consultation period lasting from March until June 2021. The NAP contains eleven commitments by the federal government (including two in cooperation with <em>l&#xe4;nder</em> governments) and three individual commitments by two <em>l&#xe4;nder</em>, covering such areas as access to legal information, open data, participation in infrastructure planning or open-source software for public administration. The Action Plan can be found <a href="https://www.open-government-deutschland.de/opengov-en/open-government-partnership-germany">here</a>.</p><p>Strategic Alignment of the German IT Planning Council</p><p>The IT Planning Council&#x2019;s future efforts as well as its operational structures are organised around a select number of multi-year strategic focus areas (https://www.it-planungsrat.de/beschluss/beschluss-2022-42). These focus areas shape the cross-functional initiatives of the IT Planning Council which reflect current trends as well as strategic questions concerning the public administration&#x2019;s digitisation efforts. They bundle individual ventures and create an increased focus towards a common goal so that the IT Planning Council, supported by additional instruments, is able to make decisions more quickly, collaborate more efficiently, and expand the impact it generates. This strategy covers: </p><ul><li>Digital infrastructure (cloud transformation);</li><li>Digital transformation (esp. digital competences / training of personnel, depletion of legal barriers, standardisation, automatisation); </li><li>Digital applications (esp. further advancement OZG, digital identity, reinforcement of re-use principle (EfA) and cooperations, SDG implementation, digital identity, federal IT architecture);</li><li>Use of Data and data privacy (esp. modernisation of registers, Once-Only principle); and</li><li>Information security.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">IT Consolidation Programme of the German Federal Government</p><p>The German cabinet decided in&#xa0;the&#xa0;summer 2015 to substantially modernise the federal&#xa0;government in the IT department.&#xa0;Consolidating&#xa0;IT at federal level&#xa0;will serve several aims, namely:&#xa0;(i) ensure information security in an increasingly complex&#x202f;IT&#x202f;environment; (ii) maintain sovereignty and control over federal IT&#x202f;also in the future; (iii) respond swiftly to technological innovations; (iv) ensure effective, efficient, stable and future-proof operations; and (v)&#xa0;enable the government&#xa0;to&#xa0;remain an attractive employer for&#x202f;IT&#x202f;experts. Data of the federal administration must be comprehensively protected and secured against misuse. Until 2022,&#x202f;IT&#x202f;consolidation has followed three lines of action: consolidating operations, consolidating services, and centralising procurement.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-129.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The laws and regulations at different levels of government have evolved independently. Due to historic reasons, the legal framework of public procurement at the federal level in Germany is embedded both in economic and budgetary law. </p><p>Thus, the complexity of the technological environment is rather high and the baseline for the introduction of modern, user-centred eProcurement systems is really demanding. Due to some more recent EU directives that did impose temporal deadlines for the implementation of eProcurement in EU Member States, the modernisation process started in 2018, when the federal electronic tendering platform was launched successfully. Parallel to the implementation of the EU Implementing Regulation establishing standard forms for the publication of notices in the field of public procurement (&#x2018;eForms&#x2019;) in 2023, a central Data Service for Public Procurement (&#x201c;Datenservice &#xd6;ffentlicher Einkauf&#x201d;) was developed by the Procurement Office of the Federal Ministry of the Interior (BMI), the central supplier to the public administration in Germany, as a federal-state project. The purpose of the service is to provide transparent information on federal, State and local government tender notices that are subject to publication requirements. </p><p>Increasing the level of functional integration between eProcurement systems at all three levels, which is necessary to meet the needs of all stakeholders, continues to be a key objective. </p><p>Already in place is the online procurement platform. The entire procedures for public procurement below EU thresholds will be digitised just like public procurement above the EU thresholds. The <a href="https://www.evergabe-online.de/">website</a> (https://www.evergabe-online.de/) can be used to conduct procurement procedures entirely online.

It will be achieved by making the legislative process at the federal level completely electronic, interoperable, and free of media discontinuity. At the same time, the process is oriented towards current technological developments, e.g. by providing LegalDocML.de, a data standard for regulatory measures, and user-friendly applications. These applications are integrated into a collaborative platform that enables, for instance, to draw up timetables for regulatory projects or to initiate in-house and interdepartmental votes. In addition to a capable editor, more than 50 working aids are provided. An example is&#xa0;the electronic Sustainability Impact Assessment (eNAP), which makes it easier to check the sustainability of draft laws and ordinances. Another example is the electronic procedure assistant (eViR) that guides users step by step through the process of drafting a federal government bill.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">High-Tech Strategy 2020 for Germany: Ideas, Innovation, Prosperity</p><p>The Federal Ministry of Education and Research has developed a&#xa0;<a href="#:~:text=The new High-tech Strategy,smart mobility, and civil security.">High-Tech Strategy&#xa0;</a>that aims to stimulate Germany&#x2019;s scientific and economic potential in a targeted way and to find solutions to global and national challenges.&#xa0;Germany would like to continue its efforts to become a worldwide innovation leader through a set of formulated innovative goals and defined priorities and introduce new instruments within a wide range of different fields of innovation. </p><p>The High-Tech Strategy is the first broad national concept which&#xa0;presents the joint vision of&#xa0;the key stakeholders involved in innovation.&#xa0;It is based on five pillars: </p><ul><li>Prioritising future challenges related to prosperity and quality of&#xa0;life;&#xa0;</li><li>Consolidating&#xa0;resources;&#xa0;</li><li>Strengthening the dynamism of innovation in&#xa0;industry;&#xa0;</li><li>Creating favourable conditions for&#xa0;innovation;&#xa0;and</li><li>Strengthening dialogue and participation.&#xa0;</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">mFUND:&#xa0;an Initiative to Support the Development of Data-Based Solutions for Mobility</p><p>The mFUND, a research initiative of the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport, has been funding research and development projects relating to digital data-based applications for mobility across all modes of transport since 2016.

To this end, the Federal Government adopted a Gigabit Strategy on 13 July 2022, containing more than 100 measures to accelerate the further expansion of digital infrastructures (https://bmdv.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Anlage/K/gigabitstrategie.pdf?__blob=publicationFile). </p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>The implementation of a potential analysis that illustrates the potential for each municipality for private fibre rollout. This new tool will significantly improve the basis for decision-making of private investors and municipalities; </li><li>The guide &#x2018;Municipal orientation aid for self-supported expansion&#x2019; was made available to municipalities;</li><li>A brochure on &#x2018;Laying methods for gigabit expansion&#x2019; was published to assist the accelerating of fibre expansion. It provides information on alternative laying methods. With the relevant standardisation by DIN and the Research Association for Roads and Transport, corresponding specifications have been made; </li><li>The gigabit register (see 5.10.7) provides detailed information on the expansion status; and</li><li>Further implementation steps include, among other things, the acceleration of approval procedures and the launch of information campaigns.</li></ul><p>In addition, the Federal Network Agency will provide regulatory support for the market-driven expansion process (e.g. the development of viable open access approaches in a multi-carrier market) on the basis of the work of the &#x2018;Gigabit Forum&#x2019; it has set up. It will also ensure that the switch from copper to fibre networks is as competitive and consumer-friendly as possible.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">GovTech </h3><p><img src="../html/img/32-160.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

European provisions &#x2013; in particular the Single Digital Gateway (SDG) Regulation&#xa0;&#x2013; forces German authorities to put the so-called Once-Only principle into practice. The act introduces a unique, trans-sectoral identification number in the German administration in line with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). The legislation also provides changes in the German fiscal code and other technical items of legislation to enable the processing of the identification number in order to provide administrative services in line with the <a href="#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Online%20Access%20Act?&amp;text=The%20Online%20Access%20Act%20(Onlinezugangsgesetz,new%20era%20of%20federal%20cooperation." typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Online Access Act</a><span resource="#:~:text=What is the Online Access Act?&amp;text=The Online Access Act (Onlinezugangsgesetz,new era of federal cooperation." property="eli:title" content="Online Access Act"/>. The implementation of the legislation is embedded in a roadmap for a modernised register landscape adopted by the federal government and the federal States.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.it-planungsrat.de/beschluss/beschluss-2021-05">roadmap</a> (<a href="https://www.it-planungsrat.de/beschluss/beschluss-2021-05">https://www.it-planungsrat.de/beschluss/beschluss-2021-05</a>) presents a systematic approach to modernising the German register landscape. The key component of a modern register landscape is its technical architecture, which should comply with the existing applications and standards of the IT Planning Council. It must be expanded in accordance with the legislative provisions already set out in the German Register Modernisation Act (<em>Registermodernisierungsgesetz, RegMoG</em>) and must guarantee not only implementation of the Once-Only principle (OOP) in Germany, but also a connection to the Once-Only system at European level. Examples of needs-based technical infrastructure expansion might include a central directory of types of evidence and interfaces enabling connectivity between existing registers. The focus of these development efforts should be on strengthening interoperability within Germany and achieving convergence with European technologies.</p><p>Furthermore, the roadmap points out that the technical architecture should not be the only focus of development; the registers themselves should be developed further with a view to ensuring that they meet minimum connectivity and data management requirements. The federal government should both provide technical and methodological backing and create incentives for the necessary work by registration bodies in this area. Academic expertise should also be drawn upon, particularly as regards data quality and the potential of register data. The German Identification Number Act (<em>Identifikationsnummerngesetz</em>, IDNrG) lists 51 registers (out of a total of over 375) that play a key role in implementing the German Online Access Act (<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG). Beyond upgrading existing registers, it is also important to examine the opportunities that exist for establishing new registers. The research community should be involved at an early stage when planning and implementing register-based census-taking and when scrutinising new registers.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services</p><p>On 18 August 2017, the&#xa0;Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services&#xa0;(<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG) entered into force. The federal, regional and local levels of government&#xa0;are&#xa0;now required to take comprehensive measures in order to promote electronic government services.&#xa0;Core requirements include:&#xa0;</p><ul><li>All (suitable) administrative services must be available online within five years after the law&#x2019;s entry into&#xa0;force;&#xa0;</li><li>Federal and municipal eGovernment services must be available both through a newly created federal online portal and the online portals of the&#xa0;federal States<em>&#xa0;(L&#xe4;nder)</em>. All portals are meant be connected to a network of portals, the&#xa0;<em>Portalverbund</em>. Thus, access to electronic government services becomes easier and more&#xa0;user-friendly; and</li><li>Access to all administrative services in the portal network must be allowed via a secure single-user account. In the user account, personal data (e.g.&#xa0;date of birth, residence) can be stored permanently for the users&#x2019; convenience, provided they have given their consent.&#xa0;</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act&#xa0;on the&#xa0;Promotion of&#xa0;Electronic&#xa0;Government</p><p>On 17 June 2013, the Bundestag, with the approval of the Bundesrat, adopted the&#xa0;Act&#xa0;on the&#xa0;promotion of&#xa0;electronic government&#xa0;(eGovernment Act,&#xa0;EGovG). The German law for the promotion of eGovernment came into effect on 1 August 2013. Its aim was to facilitate electronic communication with the administration and to enable federal,&#xa0;State&#xa0;and local authorities to provide simpler, more user-friendly and efficient eGovernment services. The main provisions&#xa0;include:&#xa0;</p><ul><li>Obligation for federal, State and local authorities to open a point of access for the transfer of electronic&#xa0;documents;&#xa0;</li><li>Obligation for federal authorities to open a De-Mail access and to offer an electronic proof of identity via electronic identity card (eID) and an electronic residence&#xa0;permit;&#xa0;</li><li>Electronic record&#xa0;keeping;&#xa0;</li><li>Enabling electronic evidence and electronic payment in administrative&#xa0;procedures;&#xa0;</li><li>Obligation to document and analyse processes before implementing IT&#xa0;systems;&#xa0;</li><li>Provision of machine-readable data (open data); and&#xa0;</li><li>Georeferencing of electronic registers.&#xa0;</li></ul><p>The eGovernment Act triggered legislative activities in most of the German federal&#xa0;States. By now,&#xa0;seven&#xa0;federal&#xa0;States have already adopted their own eGovernment Act, while several others have initiated legislative procedures.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">German Basic Law (Articles 91c and 91d)</p><p>On 1 August 2009, within the framework of the second round of reforms of Germany&apos;s federal structure, important changes in the&#xa0;German Basic Law&#xa0;(<em>Grundgesetz</em>) came into force with articles 91c and 91d. Article 91c ensured the simplification of IT bodies and decision-making processes, thus increasing their effectiveness and enabling their adaptation to the needs of the fast-evolving technical progress.&#xa0;The German federation now has the exclusive legislative competence for the development of a secure linking-up network to interconnect the IT networks of national and federal States, which can prevent any underlying media issues. Furthermore, Article 91d constituted a vital component for administrative modernisation as it provides the legal basis for facilitating the federation and the federal States to directly and effectively benchmark their administrations in order to increase their effectiveness and&#xa0;transparency and&#xa0;provide better public services.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on the Connection of Information Technology Networks of Federal and State Governments</p><p>The envisaged objectives of the German Basic Law are implemented through&#xa0;the connection of IT networks of federal and State governments (IT-NetzG),&#xa0;adopted on 10 August 2009, as well as through an Inter-federal State Agreement, which came into force on 1 April 2010. According to this agreement, the IT Planning Council was established and tasked with developing the technical requirements for the use of the core network infrastructure. Moreover, the IT Planning Council bears the responsibility to steer cross-disciplined eGovernment projects involving both the federation and the federal States. Finally, the Council adopts decisions on IT interoperability and security standards.&#xa0;</p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Single Digital Gateway Regulation</p><p>On 11 December 2018, the&#xa0;SDG Regulation 2018/1724&#xa0;entered into force. Based on a decision of the IT Planning Council, a national stakeholder network for the SDG implementation was set up in April 2019. It consisted of SDG multipliers appointed by each of the 16 federal&#xa0;States, the national coordinator appointed by the federal government, contact persons of the&#xa0;federal&#xa0;ministries and representatives of the leading municipal associations. The network will meet at least twice a year.</p><p>Implementing the requirements for the SDG in Germany is part of the implementation of the <a href="#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Online%20Access%20Act?&amp;text=The%20Online%20Access%20Act%20(Onlinezugangsgesetz,new%20era%20of%20federal%20cooperation." typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Online Access Act</a><span resource="#:~:text=What is the Online Access Act?&amp;text=The Online Access Act (Onlinezugangsgesetz,new era of federal cooperation." property="eli:title" content="Online Access Act"/> (<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG) and Register Modernisation Act and takes place within the implementation structures of these acts. The following challenges have already been resolved:</p><ul><li>Linking the Your Europe platform with the Federal Portal, including connecting the EU search engine;</li><li>Linking the Federal Portal with the eight assistance services and, accordingly, with the EU search engine;</li><li>Providing German and English descriptions of federal and State-level services for online and offline procedures; </li><li>Adhering to the Commission&#x2019;s branding requirements such as the inclusion of the Your Europe logo; and</li><li>Gathering user feedback and collecting user statistics through our national IT components.</li></ul><p>In accordance with Article 14 of the SDG Regulation, the Commission is to provide a technical system for the cross-border application of the Once-Only principle by December 2023. The interconnection of national registers throughout the EU enables the digital exchange among EU Member States of the necessary evidence for the procedures that are to be offered entirely online. </p><p>The German registers, which hold digital evidence for the procedures in question, are to be linked to the Commission&#x2019;s technical system. The European Commission is currently conducting an evidence survey to determine what evidence is needed for which procedures in Member States. Germany is also conducting such a survey at national level.</p><p>The Commission has adopted the implementing regulation (EU) 2022/1463 setting out technical and operational specifications of the technical system for the cross-border automated exchange of evidence on 5 August 2022, although the deadline of 12 June 2021 has passed. To ensure a coordinated development and operation of the OOTS sub-groups were formed. Germany is involved in every subgroup. The EU Once-Only-Technical-System will thus be further developed with support from Germany. From Germany&#x2019;s perspective, connecting the decentralised register landscape of our federal system to a central Commission system is the core challenge.</p><h2>Key Enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Open data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on&#xa0;the Reuse of Public Sector Information</p><p>The Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information (Directive (EU) 2019/1024) entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive (Directive 2003/98/EC), which was amended&#xa0;by Directive 2013/37/EU. Member States must transpose Directive (EU) 2019/1024 by 16 July 2021. Once fully transposed at national level, it will make all public sector content in principle freely available for re-use, except in very limited cases. It will stimulate the transparency, non-discrimination and non-exclusivity of data. Furthermore, real-time data available via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), open access to publicly funded research data and high value datasets will foster innovation and benefit both society and the economy.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Freedom of&#xa0;Information&#xa0;Act</p><p>After being narrowly approved by the Bundestag in early June 2005, Germany&#x2019;s&#xa0;Freedom of Information (FOI) Act&#xa0;was voted on 8 July 2005 by the Bundesrat, published in the Federal Gazette on 13 September 2005 and came into force on 1 January 2006. The law provided the public with a general right to access&#xa0;federal government information. However, this general right was limited by several broadly defined exemptions, covering, for instance, security-sensitive issues, potential threats to public safety and even the &#x201c;fiscal interests of the federal government&#x201d;. The legislation also contained an &#x2018;internet clause&#x2019; to compel federal administration bodies to make a few items publicly available online. Certain federal States also have their own Freedom of Information Legislation.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Data Act (Article 12a)</p><p>The principle of open data is becoming increasingly important worldwide and the availability of data is becoming an important economic factor.&#xa0;</p><p>Considering this, on 13 July 2017 the legislator initiated an initial amendment to the eGovernment Act (EGovG) and the newly created section 12a of the EGovG (first open data Act). This created, for the first time, a separate legal framework for open administrative data by establishing common criteria for open data. These include free provision, free access to data and machine readability. At the same time, data protection applies and it must be ensured that such personal data are only provided for publication if the requirements regarding the protection of personal data are met.</p><p>With the second Open Data Act, which entered into force on 23 July 2021 (Act amending the eGovernment Act and introducing a law on the use of public sector data), the legislator refined the existing obligations for the federal administration in various areas under Section 12a of the EGovG and significantly extended the range of authorities obliged to do so. Other key elements are the establishment of open data coordinators in the federal authorities and the inclusion of research data in the obligation to provide them. </p><p>The nation-wide meta data portal GovData was created to ensure that the open data provided by the different administrations can be easily found.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Draft Legislation Introducing a Card for EU Citizens and Members of the&#xa0;European Economic Area</p><p>The&#xa0;legislation introducing a card for EU citizens and members of the European Economic Area (<em>Gesetz zur Einf&#xfc;hrung einer Karte f&#xfc;r Unionsb&#xfc;rger und Angeh&#xf6;rige des Europ&#xe4;ischen Wirtschaftsraums mit Funktion zum elektronischen Identit&#xe4;tsnachweis sowie zur &#xc4;nderung des Personalausweisgesetzes und weiterer Vorschriften</em>) was&#xa0;adopted&#xa0;by&#xa0;the&#xa0;German&#xa0;parliament&#xa0;in June 2019.&#xa0;It introduced the electronic ID card for a larger group of people. The card is not mandatory and is available upon request for citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area. The&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card is not a classic ID since it does not contain any photograph and has an electronic chip that contains the most important biographical personal information (more specifically, name, date and place of birth, address).&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Brexit Withdrawal Agreement</p><p>The persons&#xa0;covered by the Brexit withdrawal agreement will also be&#xa0;issued an&#xa0;electronic residence permit with integrated&#xa0;eID.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eIDAS&#xa0;Implementation Act</p><p>Since 1 July 2016, the&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Regulation&#xa0;has been the single legal framework for electronic trust services across the EU. In Germany, the&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Implementation Act&#xa0;entered into force on 29 July 2017. The core of the&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Implementation Act was the Trust&#xa0;Services Act (VDG). It regulates the national requirements for the effective implementation of the&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Regulation. On 28 February 2019, the Trust Services Ordinance (VDV) came into force, providing the final specifications on the requirements for trust services and trust service providers, such as accessibility and financial security.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Identification Promotion Act</p><p>The&#xa0;Electronic Identification Promotion Act&#xa0;came into force on 15 July 2017. It aimed to promote the use and dissemination of online identification through the German&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card, making it easier and more secure.&#xa0;The&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card has an electronic proof of identity function and was introduced in 2010. This feature enables citizens, government agencies and businesses to reliably identify themselves on the internet. However, the use of the&#xa0;eID&#xa0;function&#xa0;lagged behind&#xa0;the expectations. In order to address this situation, since 15 July 2017, each new identity card is issued with a ready-to-use electronic identification function. With the Electronic Identification Promotion Act, several other additional measures were taken in order to promote the use of the national&#xa0;eID&#xa0;function. The responsible data protection authorities monitor compliance with data protection.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security Aspects</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal Data Protection Legislation</p><p>The world&#x2019;s first data protection law was passed in Germany &#x2013; or, to be more exact, in the federal&#xa0;State Hessen in 1970. In 1977, a Federal Data Protection Law followed, which was replaced in 1990, and amended in 1994 and 1997. An additional revision took place in August 2002 to align German legislation with the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Protection of Personal Data</p><p>Due to the EU&#x2019;s reform of its data protection framework in 2016 &#x2013; comprising the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), replacing Directive 95/46/EC, and the Law Enforcement Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680- LED) &#x2013; Germany revised its data protection laws at federal and <em>l&#xe4;nder</em> level. The Federal Data Protection Act, as well as a large number of other federal laws, were adapted on two successive dates.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of Base Registries</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Commercial Registry</p><p>The most important legislation&#xa0;for the Commercial Registry&#xa0;is the&#xa0;German Commercial Code. Part II, Articles 8 and 9, state that the Commercial Registry is under the control&#xa0;of the courts, and the right to inspect the Registry is open to everyone. Copies of&#xa0;the&#xa0;entries&#xa0;can&#xa0;be obtained and authenticated. Another important regulation is the&#xa0;Commercial Registry Regulation.&#xa0;According to Article 3, the Commercial Registry&#xa0;addresses&#xa0;two&#xa0;categories: individual merchants and commercial partnerships (category A) and corporations (category B). Information regarding the electronic maintenance of the Commercial Registry, recorded files, registry folders and inspections can also be found in the regulation.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Population Registry</p><p>The Population Registry falls under the&#xa0;Federal Registration Act&#xa0;(BMG). The Act regulates areas such as the required reference data to be registered, registration authorities and their duties, storage of data, accuracy and completeness of the Population Registry, information restrictions, storage and deletion of data, registration certificates, use restrictions, automatic retrieval and data transfer.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Land Registry</p><p>Both&#xa0;the&#xa0;Land Registration Code (<em>Grundbuchordnung,</em>&#xa0;GBO) and the&#xa0;Civil Code&#xa0;(BGB) contain paragraphs which are relevant to the&#xa0;Land&#xa0;Registry. The&#xa0;<em>Grundbuchordnung</em>&#xa0;places more emphasis on governing the procedural part, the required processes and formalities. Its articles cover information such as the entries to be made in the Registry,&#xa0;the rectification&#xa0;of the data, the exchange of copies of the Land Registries, public charges, access to basic files and more. The Civil Code&#xa0;covers such items as land&#xa0;leases, rental fees, annuities and property management.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Official Contracting Terms for Award of Service Performance Contracts&#xa0;</p><p>The&#xa0;government&#xa0;transposed&#xa0;Directive&#xa0;2004/17/EC,Directive&#xa0;2004/18/EC&#xa0;and Directive&#xa0;2005/51/EC&#xa0;into national law when the official contracting terms for&#xa0;the&#xa0;award of service performance contracts were published on 6 June 2006.

The amended&#xa0;Procurement&#xa0;Ordinance&#xa0;(<em>Vergabeverordnung</em>,&#xa0;VgV), which came into force on 11 June 2010, regulated the submission of electronic bids in the area of public procurement.&#xa0;The VgV specifies the regulations for awarding public contracts in the upper threshold range. The VOL/A, 2nd section has ceased to apply since April 2016 and is no longer applicable. In the case of awards below the threshold values, traditional budgetary law applies. The Sub-Threshold Regulation (<em>Unterschwellenvergabeordnung,</em> UVgO) applies to the award of contracts for supplies and services below the EU thresholds via corresponding references in the respective budget regulations. In the case of awards at the State and municipal level, this is only the case if it has come into force in the version applicable to the State; otherwise, VOL/A (1st section only) still applies here.</p><p>On 1 December 2016, the Bundestag adopted the Law on the Transposition of Directive&#xa0;on electronic invoicing&#xa0;in&#xa0;public procurement (Directive 2014/55/EU). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing </p><p>In Germany, the competence in the field of&#xa0;eInvocing&#xa0;is shared between the&#xa0;Federal Ministry of the Interior&#xa0;(at the federal level) and the&#xa0;federal&#xa0;States. The legislation in place&#xa0;makes reference&#xa0;to the&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;Law&#xa0;of&#xa0;4 April 2017 (<em>E-Rechnungsgesetz</em>), which mandates the receipt and processing of&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;for all federal contracting authorities.&#xa0;As far as other State and local entities are concerned, they shall rely on supplementary legislation by the federal States. Following a decision by the National IT Planning Council in June 2017, XRechnung, the German Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS) based on the European Norm 16931, has become the leading&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;standard for central, regional and local authorities in Germany. Furthermore, the&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;platform ZRE was activated by the federal government for B2G public procurement at the end of 2018 and the eInvoicing platform OZG-RE in fall of 2019 (see chapter 6.5 E-Rechnung). Since November 2019, all government bodies at national level must be able to receive eInvoices from suppliers. The ability to accept eInvoices&#xa0;became mandatory also at regional and municipal level on 18 April 2020. </p><p>As of 27 November 2020, suppliers of federal government authorities and agencies must submit electronic invoices for public contracts. </p><p>The regulations of the German federal States may differ.</p><h2>Domain-specific Legislation</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Commerce Act</p><p>The Electronic Commerce Act of 14 December 2001 implemented the EU eCommerce Directive (2000/31/EC) into German law. The Act amended the&#xa0;Tele Services Act&#xa0;and the&#xa0;Tele Services Data Protection Act&#xa0;of 1997&#xa0;(both of which had been adopted as part of the Information and Communication Services Act of 1 August 1997), as well as&#xa0;some provisions&#xa0;of the German Civil Code.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act&#xa0;on&#xa0;De-Mail Services and Amendments to other Legislation</p><p>The&#xa0;Act&#xa0;on&#xa0;De-Mail services and Amendments to Other&#xa0;Legislation&#xa0;contains the legal requirements for registration as a De-Mail provider. The draft was adopted by the federal cabinet on 13 October 2010 and entered into force on 3 May 2011. De-Mail enables the sending of traceable and confidential documents and messages online. Contrary to conventional e-mails, De-Mails provide proof of delivery. It is not possible to read or manipulate the contents of a De-Mail on its journey across the internet. De-Mail providers are interoperable and provide the same level of security based on an accreditation process that is specified by the legislator. De-Mail providers&#xa0;have to&#xa0;fulfil high requirements concerning security, functions, interoperability and data protection. Furthermore, the De-Mail legislation foresees that providers must not only furnish the stated certificates for security, functionality and interoperability, but must also demonstrate comprehensive measures to protect personal data within the scope of the accreditation procedure.&#xa0;</p><p>The basic specifications for security, functionality and interoperability were drawn up by the federal government together with future De-Mail providers and laid down in technical guidelines. To ensure compliance with these guidelines, De-Mail providers are screened in an accreditation process.&#xa0;De-Mail focuses&#xa0;on data protection&#xa0;and requires, for instance, that De-Mail providers can enable the&#xa0;use&#xa0;of e-mail&#xa0;pseudonyms to prevent communications&#xa0;or consumer profiles traceability. Furthermore, when requested De-Mail providers must store the&#xa0;user&#x2019;s&#xa0;encryption certificates in the directory to support (additional) end-to-end encryption of De-Mails.&#xa0;</p><p>The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has published the approval criteria on its&#xa0;website.&#xa0;</p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big Data</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud Computing</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance Computing</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Revised Telecommunications Act</p><p>The revised Telecommunications Act (TKG) entered into force in December 2021.

In order to use the full functionality of the Federal Portal it can be accessed best via the Federal User Account. This Federal User Account complies with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC - in short, the&#xa0;eIDAS&#xa0;Regulation. Federal Ministries and government agencies using this account automatically comply with EU requirements that came into force in September 2018. As part of the portal network, the Federal Portal also offers access to information, procedures and services within the jurisdiction of the federal States and municipalities. The legal basis for the entire project is the so-called&#xa0;Online Access&#xa0;Act&#xa0;(<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG) which came into force in August 2017. </p><p>The digitalisation initiative is supported by the digitalisation programme of the IT Planning Council. Within this programme, selected administrative procedures with high relevance for citizens and companies were digitalised. These procedures were made available online nationwide via the portal network.&#xa0;</p><p>The digitalisation of public administration in Germany is constantly supported by FIM (Federal Information Management). By offering textual information, form fields and processes, FIM lays the foundation for a uniform and unambiguous description and structuring of public tasks and duties both for the enforcement level and for the legislation. Furthermore, FIM provides the conditions for a simplified electronic mapping of cross-organisational administrative processes in the form of IT-based procedures. The three building blocks (services, data fields and processes) as well as the overall coordination are jointly operated by the German federal government and the State governments. The FIM portal has been online since September 2018 (fimportal.de).&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">GovData&#xa0;Portal</p><p>The German Metadata Portal GovData provides a unified, centralised access to administrative data from federal, State and local governments. The goal is to make this data accessible in one single place and thus easier to use for both citizens and businesses. In the spirit of the Open Data principle, the portal aims to promote the use of open licenses and increase the supply of machine-readable raw data.&#xa0;</p><p>In addition to the government data, the portal bundles the metadata of other sectors. A large part of the data provided include the geodata (this corresponds to all the data that can be displayed on a map) that must be made available by the Inspire Directive.</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-202.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The first research institutions have already been integrated. For example, the Robert Koch Institute supplies various numbers and indicators for the Covid-19 pandemic directly to GovData. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Subnational Platforms and Applications </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><em>Portalverbund</em></p><p>At the moment&#xa0;subnational and regional portals run independently. Following the concept of the federal State portals, the local portals will be intelligently connected with the federal structures. The portal network&#xa0;<em>Portalverbund</em>&#xa0;is part of the implementation of the German Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administrative Services and main element of the infrastructure of the Online Access Act. Currently the development of the portal network is in its final stage. Nearly each of the State portals including their basis IT components is already part of the network.&#xa0;</p><h2>Networks </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal Networks / Information Network of the Public Administration</p><p>The&#xa0;Federal Networks&#xa0;(<em>Netze&#xa0;des&#xa0;Bundes,</em>&#xa0;NdB) replace the Berlin-Bonn Information Network (IVBB) and the Information Network of the Federal Administration (IVBV) and increase the efficiency and security (in terms of availability and privacy) of the networks involved. The aim is to create a common infrastructure for the federal government in the long term.&#xa0;&#xa0;NdB&#xa0;is a&#xa0;private IP-based communication network, which serves as intranet among the different&#xa0;public administration departments. </p><p>The importance of network infrastructures has changed over the last 20 years. Today network infrastructures are essential for the modern administration.&#xa0;Nearly every public authority needs special IT procedures to perform its&#xa0;tasks. </p><p>Due to the increased threat level by highly developed malware (e.g.&#xa0;Trojan software),&#xa0;NdB&#xa0;fulfils the&#xa0;highest connection&#xa0;security requirements&#xa0;at federal and State level.&#xa0;Therefore,&#xa0;NdB&#xa0;provides firewall systems, comprehensive encryption of data communication and permanent observation of the connected users and the established connections.&#xa0;</p><p>The sponsor&#xa0;for&#xa0;NdB&#xa0;is&#xa0;the Federal Government Commissioner for Information Technology&#xa0;(<em>Beauftragte f&#xfc;r Informationstechnik der Bundesregierung</em> - BfIT).&#xa0;The&#xa0;BDBOS&#xa0;is responsible for the operation of&#xa0;NdB.&#xa0;</p><p>With the network strategy 2030 for the public administration, the connected networks of the federal administration (e.g. The federal Networks) are to be networked with the other networks of the public administration to form an information network of the public administration (Informationsverbund der &#xf6;ffentlichen Verwaltung, IV&#xd6;V).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><em>Verbindungsnetz</em> (VN)</p><p>Based on the former Deutschland Online Infrastructure, the <em>Verbindungsnetz</em> (VN) was established. The usage for federal communication is part of the German constitution (GG &#xa7;91c) and therefore mandatory for the German public administration. The VN establishes the network&#xa0;infrastructure for widespread and integrated electronic processing between federal administrative units. The VN network is as a connective network structure (coupling network) for the public administration networks in Germany, with junctions to the&#xa0;Trans-European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) network of the European Union and to the federal networks (NdB).&#xa0;With regard to TESTA, VN is the local domain of Germany and thus part of the TESTA Euro Domain.</p><h2>Data Exchange </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">De-Mail</p><p>De-Mail is an easy-to-use technology that takes conventional e-mail one step further as it allows citizens, businesses and administrations to exchange electronic messages in a secure manner. Compared to conventional e-mails, the delivery of De-Mails and the identity of senders and recipients can be proven. It is not possible to read or manipulate the contents of a De-Mail on its journey across the internet. One important aim is to make De-Mail confidential, reliable and binding through basic security functions that are easy to use and do not require additional installations for the end-user. The sender and recipient of a De-Mail can be clearly identified. Send and delivery certificates can be easily generated.</p><p>De-Mails are encrypted during transport and can neither be intercepted nor manipulated. Spam and phishing are effectively prevented because the De-Mail sender can be clearly identified by secure initial identification and users are able to log on with two-factor authentication using the new German&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card or a mobile phone-based method (mobile TAN). </p><p>Furthermore, De-Mail offers huge potential to optimise electronic communications in the private and public sector. Recently, business and administration processes were marked by media inconsistencies that produced considerable delays and additional costs. With the additional security functions that De-Mail provides, a large part of today&#x2019;s paper-based business and administration processes can now be handled fully electronically, simply, quickly and from any location. </p><p>The legal requirements&#xa0;for registration as De-Mail provider&#xa0;are contained in the&#xa0;Act&#xa0;on&#xa0;De-Mail services and amendments to other legislation, which entered into force on 3 May 2011. So far,&#xa0;Deutsche Telekom AG, GMX.DE, WEB.DE and&#xa0;Mentana&#xa0;GmbH (among others) have become accredited De-Mail providers. </p><h2>eID and Trust Services </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Identity Card	</p><p>Germany&apos;s next generation&#xa0;Identity Card (eID)&#xa0;was launched on 1 November 2010. The new&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card in credit card format replaced the existing national identity card and offers more functions than the current conventional ID. By utilising a microchip, the card provides an online authentication function, applicable to both eGovernment and eBusiness transactions. Due to the assignment of authorisation certificates and mutual authentication, cardholders can be confident that whoever requests their data is also authorised to obtain it. The secure&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card provides further protection against identity theft and offers new, user-friendly ways to guarantee valid client data for service providers and to protect young people by age verification. Furthermore, the&#xa0;eID&#xa0;card can be used as identification and authentication means for remote signatures. To ensure that national ID cards continue to serve as secure travel documents,&#xa0;eID&#xa0;cards contain biometric identifiers stored on a chip, which satisfy the requirements for official identity checks. All&#xa0;eID&#xa0;cards include a digital biometric photo; furthermore all ID cards, issued since 2 August 2021, include two fingerprints, whereas before cardholders could choose to include two fingerprints on the chip. Both identifiers provide an efficient way to increase security at border controls. </p><p>In February 2017, Germany was the first Member State to trigger the&#xa0;pre-notification procedure&#xa0;to make sure that EU citizens and businesses could use their trusted electronic identification means (eID), as provided under&#xa0;eIDAS, to digitally authenticate themselves in order to use online services across the European Union.&#xa0;elD&#xa0;cards shall guarantee a high level of security and protection of personal data. The notification procedure for the German&#xa0;eID&#xa0;was completed in 2017 at a high level of assurance.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Electronic Passport (ePass)</p><p>Germany was among the first countries to introduce the&#xa0;Electronic Passport&#xa0;(ePass), in November 2005. It was developed to comply with Council Regulation (EC)&#xa0;No 2252/2004&#xa0;and equipped with a microchip, holding the owner&#x2019;s data, such as name, surname, date of birth and nationality. Beyond traditionally relevant data, a digital facial image of the owner was also stored on the microchip. In June 2007, the revision of the&#xa0;Passport Act, as approved by the federal council, laid down the legal foundation for second generation electronic passports issued since November 2007. In addition to the digital facial image, the new passports featured two fingerprints in digital format. Fingerprints were to be stored exclusively on the passport microchip, and never stored locally on issuance authorities&#x2019; systems, or in any other central database.&#xa0;</p><p>In March 2017, Germany issued a new generation of passports. For the new passport, traditional high-quality security features were complemented by additional, innovative features combining state-of-the-art materials with cutting-edge technology.&#xa0;</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-214.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>Federal eProcurement Platform (eVergabe) and Data Service for Public Procurement (<em>Datenservice &#xd6;ffentlicher Einkauf</em>)</p><p>The&#xa0;eVergabe&#xa0;project&#xa0;was considered to be&#xa0;one of the most important projects of the&#xa0;BundOnline&#xa0;2005 initiative. The service features&#xa0;the electronic awarding of orders based on communications between the awarding agency and potential bidders that are comprehensive, legally binding and free from media discontinuities. The offering&#xa0;ranges&#xa0;from notification via electronic tender submission to contract award using the contract award platform. The documents&#xa0;containing&#xa0;the contract terms can be downloaded and bids can be submitted with an electronic signature. The&#xa0;eAward&#xa0;project falls within the remit of the&#xa0;Procurement Agency&#xa0;of the Federal Ministry of the Interior&#xa0;(BMI; responsible authority: <a href="http://www.bescha.bund.de" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="beschaffungsamt des bmi" resource="http://www.bescha.bund.de"><em>Beschaffungsamt des BMI</em></a>).&#xa0;In technical terms, the service&#xa0;was&#xa0;implemented as a web-based information and transactional platform using Java clients&#xa0;and&#xa0;combined with a&#xa0;web&#xa0;interface&#xa0;to search&#xa0;for tenders. In addition to the&#xa0;eVergabe&#xa0;platform, all public tenders from this platform are automatically and continuously published <a href="http://www.service.bund.de" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="online" resource="http://www.service.bund.de">online</a> (sector &#x201c;<em>Ausschreibungen</em>&#x201d;).&#xa0;</p><p>Starting in 2022, a new central Data Service for Public Procurement (<em>Datenservice &#xd6;ffentlicher Einkauf</em>, formerly <em>Bekanntmachungsservice</em>, BKMS) will be added to the <em>e-Vergabe</em> Platform. This will make it much easier for companies (as possible tenderers) to find relevant public invitations to tender published by awarding authorities from all three governmental levels (federal, State and local government level). The service was jointly developed as a as a federal-State project and is also operated by the Procurement Agency of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal eGovernment Shop&#xa0;</p><p>The Federal eProcurement Platform, the Procurement Agency of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, also developed the Federal&#xa0;eGovernment shop (<em>Kaufhaus des&#xa0;Bundes</em>,&#xa0;KdB). With this solution, ordering materials takes place through an electronic catalogue. Supplies of printing paper, for instance, are ordered in a few clicks. Even customised PCs and cars can be ordered online directly from the company. Conservative calculations estimate that each electronically executed order via&#xa0;KdB&#xa0;saves at least 377 minutes (which equals EUR 195 of personnel expenses) compared to the simplest form of single tender action. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eRechnung&#xa0;</p><p>The&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;service of the federal government was completed on 27 November 2019. Federal government bodies now receive and process electronic invoices via&#xa0;eInvoicing&#xa0;platforms (<em>Zentrale&#xa0;Rechnungseingangsplattform&#xa0;des&#xa0;Bundes, ZRE and&#xa0;Onlinezugangsgesetzkonforme&#xa0;Rechnungseingangsplattform, OZG-RE</em>). Since 27 November 2020, suppliers of federal government authorities and agencies have to submit electronic invoices for public contracts. The regulations of the German federal States may show some differences. </p><h2>ePayment </h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ePayBL</p><p>ePayBL&#xa0;(ePayment&#xa0;Bund-L&#xe4;nder) was established as a mandatory basic IT component&#xa0;at the federal government level. With ePayBL the members of the development community (so-called <em>Entwicklergemeinschaft</em>) - an association of the federal government (<em>Bund</em>) and the participating federal states (<em>L&#xe4;nder</em>) - have a powerful eGovernment basic component for payment transactions at their disposal. ePayBL is thus a jointly designed and developed payment component. In connection with the German Online Access Act (<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz,</em> OZG), ePayBL is intended to be the central ePayment component for the federal administration, enabling electronic payment and billing for federal administrative services. As a central data hub, ePayBL also ensures the integration of required payment service providers and the forwarding of posting-relevant data to downstream HKR (<em>Haushalts-, Kassen- und Rechnungswesen</em>, English: budgeting, cash management and accounting) and ERP systems.  </p><p> </p><p>The payment platform ePayBL offers federal authorities an efficient and simple solution for integrating electronic payment procedures for their fee-based administrative services offered via IT procedures (e.g., administrative portals or web store solutions). Citizens have the option of paying costs and fees with ePayBL using established payment methods that are familiar from the private sector, such as credit card payments or giropay. ePayBL can be flexibly integrated into existing specialized procedures and administrative portals. Through its use, billing processes are accelerated, and administrative costs are reduced, while revenues are available in a budget-compliant, secure and timely manner. This can lead to a reduction in the number of necessary reminders. The simple and version-independent integration into the specialized procedures is supported by the <em>ePayBL Connector</em>, which avoids adaptation efforts on the part of the specialized procedures during process updates. The payment platform ePayBL is very well suited for federal authorities that are already offering chargeable administrative services or goods online or intend to do so. Operators of direct and indirect federal administrations can make use of the offer of support for the integration of ePayBL. </p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Library Portal (Bibliotheksportal)&#xa0;</p><p>The&#xa0;Library Portal&#xa0;(<em>Bibliotheksportal</em>)&#xa0;provides&#xa0;quick and easy access to a wide range of information&#xa0;through the federal intranet. This&#xa0;portal&#xa0;lists the literary works, the&#xa0;electronic publications,&#xa0;the&#xa0;databases and&#xa0;the&#xa0;services&#xa0;made available by 20 libraries. Users can, anytime and from anywhere, search&#xa0;the library catalogues of all participating libraries and the portal for specialised databases, such as&#xa0;Beck-Online, Juris, Genios and the&#xa0;Munzinger&#xa0;Archive.&#xa0;In addition, the portal contains a comprehensive&#xa0;list of links to relevant internet resources.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">XRepository</p><p>XRepository is an online library for&#xa0;XML-based data exchange formats, launched in January 2009. This website constitutes a central location for the publication of a broad spectrum of data related to eGovernment projects, including data models, XML schemes and relevant documentation. Once published, the data is available for reuse by other administrations and designers of business processes.&#xa0;The website also facilitates online research on standards and interfaces, which can be subsequently downloaded at no cost. The online library is operated by the Co-ordination Office for IT Standards (KoSIT) in Bremen.&#xa0;</p><h2>Cross-border infrastructures</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">BRIS, ECRIS and EUCARIS</p><p>The data&#xa0;of&#xa0;the German Business Registry can be accessed by EU Member States through the&#xa0;Business Registers Interconnection System (BRIS). In regard to its criminal register, Germany has implemented the Council Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA and is connected to the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), which is actively used. Germany is also a member of&#xa0;EUCARIS (EUropean<em>&#xa0;</em>CAR<em>&#xa0;</em>and driving licence&#xa0;Information&#xa0;System).&#xa0;EUCARIS is an exchange mechanism that connects the Vehicle and Driving Licence Registration Authorities in Europe. It is not a database nor a central repository&#xa0;but a secure, harmonized and efficient technical network for exchanges.&#xa0;EUCARIS is developed by and for governmental authorities. It is sustainable since it has proved to be extendable and can serve various purposes.&#xa0;</p><h2>Base Registries</h2><p>Services Registry - German Administration Services Directory</p><p>The&#xa0;German Administration Services Directory&#xa0;(DVDV) is&#xa0;a multilevel and cross-sectoral infrastructure component of eGovernment in Germany. More specifically, it is the professional and administrative cross-border infrastructure that ensures the safe and reliable provision of automated services and specialised procedures, as well as the secure and legally binding communication between authorities and with the public administration in Germany. The DVDV is based on a directory which lists agencies and other providers with their respective services.&#xa0;</p><p>The DVDV relies exclusively on open internet protocols. Worldwide, it is one of the first and largest standardised Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) implementations in the government area and was made possible through unique cooperation between various levels of government and sectors in the Federal Republic of Germany.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Register Factory</p><p>Germany has developed a new innovative tool to ensure&#xa0;a&#xa0;more efficient registry creation and administration, known as the&#xa0;Register Factory. The Register Factory provides an approach to IT which implies availability and reusability of the developed assets for any public authority wanting to create and maintain base registries. Such assets include standardised architecture, solutions, technical infrastructure, cross-sectional components, programming libraries and middleware, all of which are available for free as open source.&#xa0;</p><p>The Register Factory is a solution for the construction and operation of IT systems to conduct electronic registrations in the Federal Office of Administration. The standards and tools of the Register Factory include blueprints, building blocks, an operating platform and methodological guidelines for software engineering and development tools. The Register Factory is designed to support custom software&#xa0;development. Business Information Systems, in general, can be built using the technical foundations.&#xa0;The Register Factory provides additional registry-specific blueprints and building blocks to build registries. All parts can be used either in combination or separately.&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Further Developments</p><p>The&#xa0;German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community&#xa0;has identified strategic aims and possible activities for modernising registers.

This includes responsibility for the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and value-based Digital Government. </p><p>The Federal Academy of Public Administration (BAk&#xf6;V) is also part of Directorate-General DG. Bak&#xf6;V offers training courses tailored to staff needs so that federal employees can maintain and expand their professional knowledge and (digital) skills. The German federal administration faces four central challenges in order to remain resilient and capable in the long term. These are: (i) demographic change; (ii) increasing employer competition on the labour market; (iii) technological change, and (iv) transformation in sustainability und climate neutrality. To address these challenges BAk&#xf6;V established, inter alia, its new Digital Academy. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.digitalakademie.bund.de/">Digital Academy</a> (<a href="https://www.digitalakademie.bund.de/">https://www.digitalakademie.bund.de/</a> ) supports the federal administration with training courses to master the digital transformation. The Digital Academy is an important lever for the German Digital Strategy. The Academy is designed to connect the federal administration internally and train technical skills, methods and cultural competencies through a strong network. The Academy follows the best practice of hybrid learning by including both a physical campus and an online platform that offers courses, webinars, lectures, training and coaching. These mixed methods are intended to maximise accessibility and scalability. Furthermore, the Federal Academy offers a lot of trainings and networking activities regarding information technology, cyber security, data protection, project management, digital accessibility and digital skills in sustainability like Green-IT. Within these issues the academy established modern training paths for different levels of skill requirements and different target groups. The academy offers a comprehensive digital training for the Federal administration.    </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Directorate-General for Digital Administration: Management of the Online Access Act</p><p>Since June 2020, the competence for the digital transformation of Germany&#x2019;s administration is pooled in a separate Directorate-General for the Digital Administration and Management of the Online Access Act within the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community.
