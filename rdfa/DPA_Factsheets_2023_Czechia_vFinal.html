The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-267.png" alt="32-267.png" class="keepElement"/></p><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">&#xa0;Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022&#xa0;</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Czechia in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p/><p>The overall positive scores for Czechia on Scoreboard 1 showcase a very good implementation of the majority of the EIF Principles. Indeed, Czechia received the highest score (4) and performs above the EU average for 10 Principles out of 12, except for Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility) and Principle 9 (Multilingualism), for which the score of 3 could be further improved to reach the European average. Particularly, Czechia could further use information systems and technical architecture to cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 &#x2013; Recommendation 16) in order to increase its score. In addition, Czechia should further ensure that all European public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 &#x2013; Recommendation 7) in order to reach the highest score of 4 for this Principle.  </p><p> </p><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Czechia&#x2019;s scores in Scoreboard 2 illustrate an overall very good performance of the country with only scores of 4, and above the EU average, for all interoperability layers. In addition, it should be noted that the country has improved its score on Semantic Interoperability from 3 to 4 between 2021 and 2022. The only potential area for improvement for Czechia could be to further clarify and formalise its organisational relationships for establishing and operating European public services (Organisational interoperability &#x2013; Recommendation 29) in order to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Czech results with regard to the Conceptual model in Scoreboard 3 show an overall good performance with scores of 3 and 4 in all areas of the conceptual model. The only two areas where Czechia is below the EU average are the area of Catalogues and the one of External information sources and services. In this regard, the country should continue to put in place catalogues of public services, public data and interoperability solutions and use common models for describing them (Catalogues &#x2013; Recommendation 44), as well as on using external information sources and services while developing European public services (Eternal information sources and services &#x2013; Recommendation 45) in order to reach the maximum score in both these areas as well. </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Czechia regarding Cross-Border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show a good performance for the country. Indeed, the country received the highest score of 4 for six Principles, for all interoperability layers and for three areas of the Conceptual model. In addition, it scores above the EU average for the majority of the cross-border indicators. Potential areas for improvement are found on the Base Registries area of the Conceptual model, where Czechia should work towards making authoritative sources of information available to others while implementing access and control mechanisms to ensure security and privacy (Base Registries &#x2013; Recommendation 37) as well as further develop interfaces with base registries and authoritative sources of information, publish the semantic and technical means and documentation needed for other to connect and reuse available information (Base Registries &#x2013; Recommendation 38).  </p><p>Additional information on Czechia&#x2019;s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring" property="dct:relation">interactive dashboards</a><span resource="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring" property="eli:title" content="interactive dashboards"/>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-361.png" alt="32-361.png" class="keepElement"/></p></div><div resource="http://example.org/ContactPoint/Czechia" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-374.png" alt="A picture containing night sky
