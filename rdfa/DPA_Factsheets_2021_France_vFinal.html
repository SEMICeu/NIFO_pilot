This agile and collaborative programme aims to help the State seize the opportunities offered by digital technologies to improve public services and bring the administration closer to citizens, businesses and civil servants. Tech.gouv addresses six priority issues: simplification, inclusion, attractiveness, command, economies and alliances. The strategy is structured around eight missions: </p><ul><li>Four missions related to digital products and services to develop new uses (labelling, digital identity, data and infrastructure); </li><li>Four missions related to the promotion of digital expertise to accelerate public service transformation (pilot, talents, factory and transformation).</li></ul><p>Tech.gouv is accompanied by a three-year action plan centred on 35 priority projects and actions.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Strategy for an Inclusive Digital Society</p><p>In September 2018, the <a href="https://societenumerique.gouv.fr/plannational/">National Strategy for an Inclusive Digital Society and the initiative Digital in Common(s)</a> were launched on the occasion of the first event bringing together all actors of digital mediation. The objective is to train 1.5 million people in digital literacy to reduce inequalities and provide equal opportunities for all throughout the country. With 13 million French people who still do not use the internet, or only to a limited extent, including 6.7 million who never connect to the internet, the government faces a real challenge to carry out the digital transformation of the State. The National Strategy is based on four main approaches:</p><ul><li>Detecting audiences struggling with digital technology;</li><li>Offering human support in the process;</li><li>Training those who wish to do so thanks to the Digital Pass; </li><li>Strengthening the players in digital mediation.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Action 2022 </p><p>The <a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/action-publique-2022-pour-une-transformation-du-service-public" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Public Action 2022</a><span resource="http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/action-publique-2022-pour-une-transformation-du-service-public" property="dct:title" content="Public Action 2022"/> programme was launched in September 2017 by the French Prime Minister, &#xc9;douard Philippe, aiming to modernise the State. The programme has three objectives: improving the quality of public service provided to the user; improving the working conditions of staff; and helping to control the budget path. To achieve these objectives, the government developed a National Strategy for the Transformation of Public Action, published at the <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/action-publique-2022/actualites/un-2eme-comite-interministeriel-de-la-transformation-publique-ce-quil-faut-retenir">second Inter-ministerial Committee for Public Transformation</a> in October 2018. The Strategy includes precise and quantifiable indicators to measure and report on the success of the programme. French citizens will thus be able to monitor the progress of the reforms. The ambition is to have a closer, simpler and more efficient State to better meet citizens&apos; expectations, with transparency in monitoring being a guarantee of the success of reforms.</p><p>The National Strategy is based on four streams guiding the government&apos;s action: </p><ul><li>Public services closer to users;</li><li>Simpler and more accessible approaches;</li><li>Clearer and more effective public intervention; </li><li>A State that transforms itself.</li></ul><p>A considerable part of the action in the field involves digital solutions, thus contributing to the promotion and development of digital government. </p><p>In June 2019, the Prime Minister launched the second part of the initiatives aiming at public transformation, inspired by citizens&#x2019; contributions to the <em>Grand d&#xe9;bat national, </em>a public consultation conducted earlier in the year. This second part is centred on three priority commitments: a simpler and more responsive administrative organisation; closer and more accessible administrations; and a more efficient administration, able to leverage digital tools for the benefit of end-users, public servants and public policies.</p><p>This over-arching strategy has been implemented by each Ministry through Ministerial Transformation Plans that define the modalities for implementing major government reforms (milestones, achievements and impact indicators). The monitoring of the implementation of these reforms is carried out by the Inter-ministerial Directorate for Public Transformation with the Offices of the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic and takes the form of high-level follow-up meetings scheduled at regular intervals. Since the programme&#x2019;s launch, five Inter-ministerial Committees for Public Transformation have been organised, the latest one having taken place in February 2021, with <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/transformation-publique/comites-interministeriels-de-la-transformation-publique/article-citp">renewed commitments for the State&#x2019;s digital transformation</a>. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministerial Transformation Plans</p><p>Following the roadmap that the Prime Minister sent to each member of the government at the beginning of his term of office, each Minister has now drawn up a <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/action-publique-2022/plans-de-transformation/les-plans-de-transformation-ministeriels">Ministerial Transformation Plan</a>, for which he/she is responsible, to ensure the implementation of the main reforms. After the design and trade-off phase, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Inter-Ministerial Committee for the Transformation of Public Action (CITP) was introduced to accelerate the implementation of the Ministries&apos; roadmaps and their Transformation Plans. These Plans are monitored at the highest level to ensure that the reforms undertaken are translated into concrete results. The ambition is to have a closer, simpler and more efficient State to better meet citizens&apos; expectations.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministerial Digital Transformation Plans </p><p>As part of the <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/laction-publique-se-transforme/avec-les-administrations-et-les-operateurs-publics/action-publique-2022" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Public Action 2022</a><span resource="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/laction-publique-se-transforme/avec-les-administrations-et-les-operateurs-publics/action-publique-2022" property="dct:title" content="Public Action 2022"/> initiative launched by the Prime Minister in October 2017, at the end of the same year the Minister for the Armed Forces defined a roadmap setting three objectives for the <a href="http://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/articles/le-ministere-des-armees-presente-son-plan-transformation-numerique">digital transformation</a> of the Ministry:</p><ul><li>Ensure operational superiority and information literacy in theatres of operations;</li><li>Strengthen the efficiency of support and facilitate the daily lives of staff; </li><li>Improve the relationship with citizens and the attractiveness of the Ministry.</li></ul><p>This Ministerial Digital Transformation Plan was the first to be presented and sets out actions in a concrete way, as the Minister for the Armed Forces reminded: &#x201c;After four months of work, we are now entering the action phase. This Plan offers concrete measures to fully achieve our objectives and address the digital transformation&#x201d;.</p><p>At the same time, the education system is engaged in profound <a href="https://www.education.gouv.fr/cid133192/le-numerique-service-ecole-confiance.html">pedagogical and organisational transformations</a>, from nursery schools to post-baccalaureate, requiring to thoroughly mobilise the potential of digital technology. Digital technology represents a powerful lever for transformation to support ministerial policy in all its dimensions: pedagogical transformation, with digital technology at the service of learning and evaluation; training in the challenges and professions of tomorrow; simplification of relations with users; and modernisation of the functioning of the State with redesigned information systems. In addition, today the Ministry of National Education produces a very large amount of data related to school life, student assessments and results, and work and homework performed by students. A wide variety of personal digital data is collected, stored and processed by a multitude of actors (schools and educational institutions, academic services, local authorities, and private partners providing educational resources and digital services). In this context, the Ministry must ensure that the flow, processing and storage of school data strictly respects the privacy of students and their families, teachers and administrative staff. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Local Administration Joint Development Programme </p><p>The State Secretary for Digital Affairs launched the <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/programme-dcant/">Digital Local Administration Joint Development Programme (DCANT)</a> in 2018. The programme was co-created by associations of elected representatives and representatives of governmental services. It aimed at promoting the roadmap for regional digital transformation, as well as building complementary and efficient digital public services. The programme had four priorities:</p><ul><li>Building a common foundation for applications, digital blocks, and shared frameworks to accelerate digital transformation;</li><li>Guaranteeing shared governance of the digital transformation between the State and local authorities;</li><li>Contributing to a global approach to data to the benefit of public policies;</li><li>Facilitating the scaling up of digital administration.</li></ul><p>Since the adoption of the programme, the actions linked to these priorities have been updated/enriched every six months and reviewed by a steering committee. A <a href="https://www.lagazettedescommunes.com/telechargements/2021/02/bilan-dcant-20182020-final.pdf">report</a> on the final results of the DCANT Program was published in January 2021.</p><p>The programme&#x2019;s objectives have mainly been reached and, to build on the several successes of the last two programme editions (2015-2017 and 2018-2020), a new programme will be launched in May 2021 and should pursue 3 main goals: </p><ul><li>Building strong political steering and involvement on the program&#x2019;s topics;</li><li>Making the stakeholders invest time and resources to create value through the implementation of concrete digital solutions impacting positively French citizens&#x2019; life and/or public servants&#x2019; work for local authorities;</li><li>Reinforcing the elements of the French Recovery plan dedicated to the digital transformation of local authorities with complementary actions to reach the digital transformation sought by the French government. This program will last 2 years (instead of 3) to match the duration of the <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/france-relance">France Relance</a> economic recovery plan that was launched by the Prime Minister on 3 September 2020 following the COVID economic crisis.</li></ul><p>These objectives of the upcoming plan are set to increase the digital transformation of the State by building, together with citizens, private partners, public servants, and State and elected representatives, a collaborative digital administration that should be:</p><ul><li>Inclusive and efficient;</li><li>Open and transparent; </li><li>Secured and promoting French and European sovereignties. </li></ul><p>The results of the programme&#x2019;s initiative will be followed by a coordination review steering committee.

It encourages the use of Cloud Computing based on an offer split into 2 parts:</p><ul><li>Internal cloud, which corresponds to infrastructure fully controlled by the French central administration, including hosting, engineering, operations, monitoring. This internal cloud is reserved for the most sensitive data and applications and for the exclusive use of the central administration. Local administrations and public companies cannot therefore access such resources. Two platforms are in production, each supported by a ministry and all on Openstack technologies. They both offer a high level of resilience with two regions and multiple availability zones;</li><li>External cloud, which gathers all resources that can be found on the internet. It can be mobilised whenever permitted by the context, mixing different levels of sensitivity and application criticality regarding service continuity considerations. The use of the external cloud is allowed to central administrations under the strict condition: sensitive data has to be hosted by cloud providers with SecNumCloud qualification (delivered by ANSSI - the French National Cybersecurity Agency of France) and out of the reach of extra-EU regulations. Such condition is without prejudice to other rules application (GDPR or health-related information). The external cloud is the subject of a public contract open to the whole French public administrations (or sector) giving access to the main public Cloud offers (IaaS and PaaS). ANSSI works in close cooperation with ENISA in the trust label convergence process, therefore the European standard has replaced the SecNumCloud requirement for the French Administration.</li></ul><p>On 17 May 2021, the French government presented an updated version of its <a href="https://www.economie.gouv.fr/cloud-souverain-17-mai">Cloud Strategy</a>. Cloud computing is one of the priority projects for the digital transformation of the French State. The French State Cloud strategy aims at encouraging public actors to seize the opportunities attached to the Cloud with the ultimate objective to provide a better public service to citizens, while at the same time keeping strict control over sensitive data.</p><p>The challenges are therefore at several levels:</p><ul><li><strong>A transformation</strong> challenge: cloud computing is an enabler of a wider transformation, involving agility with business stakeholders, technical leadership and IT delivery transformation towards DevOps;</li><li><strong>A sovereignty</strong> challenge: the adoption of the cloud should not hinder France&#x2019;s autonomy in terms of decision-making or action, even though the leadership on the cloud computing playground currently seems beyond the reach of European players;</li><li><strong>An industrial</strong> challenge: the adoption of Cloud Computing by the French administrations is a win-win opportunity for key European IT-players. Public administrations seek the best-in-class cloud services and can offer significant and reliable revenue perspectives.</li></ul><p><img src="../html/img/35-434.jpeg" alt="35-434.jpeg" class="keepElement"/></p><p>	 Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><p>4</p><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/legalframework/France" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2>Specific legislation on digital public administration</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law for a State at the Service of a Society based on Trust</p><p>The <a href="https://www.vie-publique.fr/actualite/panorama/texte-discussion/projet-loi-pour-etat-au-service-societe-confiance.html" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law for a State at the Service of a Society based on Trust</a><span resource="https://www.vie-publique.fr/actualite/panorama/texte-discussion/projet-loi-pour-etat-au-service-societe-confiance.html" property="eli:title" content="Law for a State at the Service of a Society based on Trust"/> was promulgated on 10&#xa0;August 2018, establishing the principle of the right to error (in French <em>droit &#xe0; l&#x2019;erreur</em>) and including a series of measures to simplify administrative formalities. </p><p>The first part of the Law provides that French citizens who make a mistake in official declarations to the administration will not incur any penalty for the first error as long as it was made in good faith.

The PACTE has two objectives: making companies grow so that they create more jobs and redefining the place of companies in society to better involve employees. From creation to transfer, the PACTE removes obstacles, simplifying business creation and easing workforce thresholds. In particular, entrepreneurs&#x2019; lives will be simplified thanks to the creation of a single online platform for business formalities. The PACTE is a new step in the country&apos;s economic transformation and the fourth phase of the economic reforms initiated by the government more than two years ago. The Action Plan is in line with ordinances for strengthening social dialogue and the tax reform initiated by the <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000036339197&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id">2018 Budget</a> Law. Moreover, the PACTE acts in parallel with the Law on the Freedom to Choose One&apos;s Professional Future to give small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the means to create jobs.
