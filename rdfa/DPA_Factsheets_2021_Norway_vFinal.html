The purpose of eHandel.no is to give public sector entities and their suppliers easy access to a user-friendly and affordable tool for operational eProcurement.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Doffin: Public Procurement Database</p><p><a href="https://doffin.no/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="doffin" resource="https://doffin.no/">Doffin</a> aims to facilitate public authorities in complying with Norwegian public procurement regulations by allowing the creation and publication of tender notices. Since all notices are published on this platform, it is also a great resource for suppliers interested in business opportunities in the public sector. Tender publication is mandatory on Doffin, while eProcurement services are not. It is administered by The Norwegian Agency for Public and Financial Management.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">EHF </p><h2>ePayment</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInnsyn</p><p>The common solution <a href="https://einnsyn.no/sok?sort=" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="einnsyn" resource="https://einnsyn.no/sok?sort=">eInnsyn</a>, based on the previous Electronic Public Records (OEP) solution, is a tool that allows central government agencies to publicise their public records online. The new solution enables more openness and accessibility regarding public information and strengthens the freedom of information. The solution was launched in January 2018.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.arkivverket.no/en/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="national archival services" resource="https://www.arkivverket.no/en/">National Archival Services</a> have provided common standards and specifications for digital archiving, which are now used by most public organisations in the country. It should be noted, however, that compatibility among large public databases remains relatively limited.</p><p>The National Archives provide a shared platform for publishing digitalised archive material, called the <a href="https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="digital archives" resource="https://www.digitalarkivet.no/en/">Digital Archives</a>. The publishing platform is mainly used by the National Archives but is also open to other Norwegian archives, e.g. municipal and regional archives.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Municipal Data Lakes</p><p>The city of Bergen was one of the first municipalities to establish a <a href="https://www.bouvet.no/bouvet-deler/et-ordentlig-datasjoprosjekt" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="data lake" resource="https://www.bouvet.no/bouvet-deler/et-ordentlig-datasjoprosjekt">data lake</a>. This implies that the Bergen municipality is partnering with Bouvet, a consultancy, in establishing a data lake. The project ensures sharing and reusing data across divisions in the municipality, as well as facilitating new innovation and digitalisation partnerships. The private sector is invited to build their own solutions on top of the data in the data lake. The beneficiaries are the people living in Bergen, the municipality&#x2019;s partners and local businesses. Other municipalities, notably Stavanger, have also taken steps to establish a data lake.</p><h2>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">European initiatives</p><p>The Br&#xf8;nn&#xf8;ysund Register Centre is a member of the <a href="http://www.ebr.org/index.php/member-countries/european-interactive-map/norway/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="european business registry" resource="http://www.ebr.org/index.php/member-countries/european-interactive-map/norway/">European Business Registry</a>, and takes part in the Business Registry Interconnection System (BRIS) project.</p><p>The Br&#xf8;nn&#xf8;ysund Register Centre and <a href="https://www.sdir.no/en/about-us/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="the norwegian maritime authority (nma) " resource="https://www.sdir.no/en/about-us/">The Norwegian Maritime Authority (NMA) </a> participate in the <a href="http://www.toop.eu/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="toop-project " resource="http://www.toop.eu/">TOOP-project </a> (Once-Only principle). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Nordic Initiatives</p><p>Moreover, since 2016 a collaboration-project between all the Nordic governments called <a href="https://nordicsmartgovernment.org/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="smartgovernment" resource="https://nordicsmartgovernment.org/">SmartGovernment</a> has been in place. The project was funded by Nordic Innovation, an instrument under the Nordic Council of Ministers, which is an official inter-governmental body for cooperation in the Nordic region. SmartGovernment aims to create a platform for transactional reporting of business data for small and medium businesses in order to reduce, or even eliminate, the need for reporting and facilitate B2B use of information. For the 2018-2020 period the project focussed on interoperability, automated flow of data, rules for exchange of business data, and communication and stakeholder engagement. The success of SmartGovernment solutions depends on extensive access to base registries.</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">KOSTRA</p><p>The Municipality-State-Reporting <a href="http://www.ssb.no/kostra/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="kostra" resource="http://www.ssb.no/kostra/">KOSTRA</a> system allows municipalities and counties to report electronically to the State data on the economy, schools, health, culture, the environment, social services, public housing, technical services and transport, and communication. KOSTRA focuses on two main purposes: providing better information about the municipalities at central and local government level and striving for more efficient reporting. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Population Register</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Altinn</p><p>A common technical platform, called <a href="https://www.altinn.no/en/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="altinn" resource="https://www.altinn.no/en/">Altinn</a>, was created for the public sector to exchange data from base registries with the purposes of prefilling digital forms, reporting to the public sector and for lookup-services in the base registries, e.g. the National Population Registry and the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities. Altinn, now run by the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency, contains an authorisation module that governs access to services by the role of individuals and businesses. The businesses roles, e.g. director, board member, accountant, are managed in the Entity Registry. The Norwegian Entity Registry (or Central Coordination Register for Legal Entities, CCR) contains information about both businesses and public entities (meant as governmental agencies). A new registry, currently under development within the Br&#xf8;nn&#xf8;ysund Registry Centre, will add authorisation by proxy. This will furthermore extend the authorisation component in Altinn. The authorisation component also manages data sharing with user consent. Moreover, Altinn maintains the Norwegian metadata repository SERES, which is a standard for the design of web forms in Altinn.</p><p>In June 2020, <a href="https://altinn.github.io/docs/ny-funksjonalitet/prosjekter/tjenester30/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="altinn 3.0" resource="https://altinn.github.io/docs/ny-funksjonalitet/prosjekter/tjenester30/">Altinn 3.0</a> was released. The end-of-life for the technology upon which Altinn was previously built, namely Microsoft Inpath, was announced. The development of Altinn 3.0 was therefore crucial to guarantee its future. As part of Altinn 3.0, <a href="https://www.altinndigital.no/altinn-studio/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="altinn studio" resource="https://www.altinndigital.no/altinn-studio/">Altinn Studio</a> was developed. Altinn Studio can be used to develop and run everything from simple forms to complete applications. This solution is based on open-source components and has been developed to allow service owners to develop modern applications on a scalable and future-oriented infrastructure for citizens and businesses. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Land registry and Cadastre</p><p>The <a href="https://kartverket.no/en/about-the-norwegian-mapping-authority/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="norwegian mapping authority" resource="https://kartverket.no/en/about-the-norwegian-mapping-authority/">Norwegian Mapping Authority</a> is responsible of the Land Registry and the Cadastre. The Land Registry, serving as a central database, is fully digitised. The Norwegian Mapping Authority does registration of documents, data checking and recording. The Norwegian Cadastre is a public registry of real properties, including information on buildings and addresses. The Cadastre is administered and technically hosted by the Norwegian Mapping Authority. Municipalities undertake cadastral surveying. These two central databases are technically linked, providing an integrated online service to users.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Business Registry</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Contact and Reservation Register</p><p>The <a href="https://www.norge.no/en/update-your-contact-information" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="contact and reservation register" resource="https://www.norge.no/en/update-your-contact-information">Contact and Reservation Register</a> is a Norwegian base register containing information on citizens&#x2019; digital contact data, e.g. mobile phone number and e-mail address.
