The Start-up Plan, for example, was a concrete first step to encourage young and beginner entrepreneurs to set up new businesses in innovative sectors via initiatives such as tax shelters for start-ups and fiscal incentives for crowdfunding. Another initiative aimed to roll out eInvoicing for suppliers. Further initiatives are to be launched, such as the National Alliance for Digital Skills and Jobs, a plan for a high-speed internet roll-out, the Digital Health Valley, the Digital Act (a series of legislative proposals enabling, among other things, the use of electronic signatures and digital archiving, in order to replace paper-based solutions), the deployment of the federal cloud, a mobile authentication for eGovernment applications, a multi-directional digital communication platform and an open data strategy.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal eGovernment Strategy for the Social Sector (2009&#x2212;present)</p><p>The Federal <a href="https://www.ksz-bcss.fgov.be/en">eGovernment Strategy</a> for the social sector aims to create a single virtual public administration while respecting the privacy of users, as well as the specificities and competences of all government bodies and administrative layers.</p><p>Its main objective is to improve the delivery of public services for citizens and businesses by rendering it faster, more convenient, less constraining and more open. </p><p>The current strategy is outlined as follows: </p><ul><li>Formulation of specific objectives, such as optimal service delivery to citizens, limitation of administrative burden and optimisation of the efficiency and effectiveness of public services;</li><li>Explicit choice to opt for stakeholders&#x2019; collaboration in order to create added value for users of eGovernment services;</li><li>Common vision for the use of information in terms of information modelling, mandatory reporting of supposed errors, electronic exchange of information, single collection of information;</li><li>Use of a common vision for information security and protection of privacy;</li><li>Maximum use of common elements for networks, eID, interconnected middleware and related basic services;</li><li>Role of the <a href="https://www.ksz-bcss.fgov.be/en">Crossroads Bank for Social Security</a> (CBSS) as driver for eGovernment development in the social sector; and</li><li>Establishment of a strong partnership among all social security institutions.</li></ul><p>To meet the above-mentioned objectives, the Belgian eGovernment Strategy was based in the past on four main strategic streams:</p><ul><li>1<sup>st </sup>stream: re-engineering and integrating service delivery. </li></ul><p>This first stream focused on user needs, life events and simplification of all administrative procedures. </p><ul><li>2<sup>nd</sup> stream: cooperation among all levels of government to provide integrated services across organisational boundaries and administrative layers. </li></ul><p>The second stream was based on two documents. The first one, the eGovernment Cooperation Agreement, was signed in March 2001 by the federal, regional and local authorities. It laid down a cooperation framework according to which all layers of government committed to using the same standards, the same identification infrastructure and the same eSignature. The second one, the Cooperation Agreement on the Principles of a Seamless eGovernment, signed in April 2006, set the objective of using those information and communication technologies (ICTs) that provide information to all citizens, businesses and public institutions in a user-friendly way.</p><ul><li>3<sup>rd</sup> stream: simplification of administrative procedures for citizens and businesses, which requires an increased exchange and sharing of both data and information among government departments and agencies.</li><li>4<sup>th</sup> stream: back office integration and protection of personal data.</li></ul><p>The department or agency requiring specific data will be considered most frequently as a trusted source by other administrations that may need such data.

During the second half of 2019, the Belgian government developed a communication campaign on social media to promote private partners in the eBox ecosystem. These private partners offer to their clients the possibility to consult government documents with their applications. During this campaign, the following partners were promoted: Doccle, bpost bank, Trusto. In December 2019, the government released a communication campaign on national television and radio aimed to raise awareness around eBox. In 2020, the Flemish government and local governments also started to use the eBox as their electronic mailbox for sending official government documents.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Wallonia (2015 &#x2212; present)</p><p>On 6 December 2018, the Walloon government adopted the second version of its <a href="https://www.digitalwallonia.be/fr/publications/2019-2024">Digital Wallonia Strategy</a> for the period 2019&#x2212;2024. The strategy set the direction to allow the region of Wallonia to seize the socio-economic opportunities of the digital transformation. Just like the first version of 2015, which was based on the contributions of more than 100 actors and organizations, Digital Wallonia 2019&#x2212;2024 is the result of the work of the Digital Wallonia Champions.</p><p>This strategy is structured around five major goals: </p><ol><li>Digital sector: the goal is to create a strong technological sector by means of a growth programme, which aims to give Wallonia&#x2019;s digital sector an international dimension; </li><li>Digital economy: the goal is to increase the digital capabilities of companies, which is essential for the development of connected commerce;</li><li>Connected and intelligent territory: the goal is to achieve full high-speed connectivity in Wallonia; </li><li>Open utilities: the goal is to foster open and transparent digital public services; and </li><li>Skills and employment: the goal is developing Wallonia&#x2019;s citizens&#x2019; digital skills.</li></ol><p>More than 20 projects have been implemented as part of the Digital Wallonia Strategy. For example, <a href="https://www.digitalwallonia.be/fr/publications/digitalwallonia4-ai-home">Digital Wallonia 4 AI</a> is now the roadmap for the development of Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, while <a href="https://www.digitalwallonia.be/en/tags/industry-of-the-future-2020#digitalSectors">Digital Wallonia Industry of the Future</a> is the framework for the adoption of the industry 4.0 by factories of the manufacturing sectors, Digital Wallonia Giga Region defines the priorities to offer high-speed fixed and mobile networks to all citizens and companies in Wallonia.</p><p>The strategy marked the Walloon government&#x2019;s stated ambition to transform Wallonia into a connected and smart territory, where technological companies are recognised as leaders and as the driving force behind the region&#x2019;s successful industrial transformation. </p><p>In 2019, the new regional government confirmed Digital Wallonia as the digital roadmap for Wallonia. Consequently, the Digital Wallonia Strategy is now fully integrated into the political declaration of the Walloon government.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Master Plan and Digital Vision of the Ministry of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation</p><p>In May 2016, the Belgian government <a href="http://www.federation-wallonie-bruxelles.be/index.php?id=strategie">signed</a> the first Master Plan of the Ministry of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation (MFWB). This <a href="http://www.federation-wallonie-bruxelles.be/index.php?eID=tx_nawsecuredl&amp;u=0&amp;g=0&amp;hash=73fd7c902140eaefc79e39c16c2a726934577a2f&amp;file=fileadmin/sites/portail/uploads/Illustrations_documents_images/A._A_propos_de_la_Federation/4._Ministere/4.3._Plan_du_management/CA_FWB_version-integrale.pdf">Master Plan</a> for public services represented a first-time effort to set up a global, integrated and consistent roadmap with precise goals, proper governance and adequate funding. </p><p>The digital part of the Master Plan is divided into eight areas, which constitute the pillars of the government&#x2019;s digital vision. The first pillar aims to work on the user experience, which includes both external users of the public service (e.g., citizens, non-marketers) and internal users. The second pillar concerns data, which represent a relevant component of the entire digital approach. The third pillar is mainly internal and focuses on the digital workplace. The fourth pillar is dedicated to innovation. The fifth pillar concerns digital governance. The sixth pillar targets the digital culture of the organisation, including the acquisition of digital skills and management changes . The seventh pillar is devoted to the necessary resources, including the IT infrastructure. The eighth and most important pillar is the digital platform. It consists of all the IT capabilities of the MFWB. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Flanders eGovernment Strategy </p><p>As to the Flemish Region, the eGovernment Strategy is under the responsibility of the Minister-President of the Flemish government. It is managed by the Flanders Information Agency, which was created in 2015 by merging the Flemish eGovernment Coordination Cell (CORVE), the <a href="http://www.vlaamseinfolijn.be/"><em>Vlaamse Infolijn</em></a> (the Flemish government call-centre), the <a href="https://www.agiv.be/">Flanders Geographical Information Agency</a> (AGIV) and part of the Department for Administrative Affairs. This agency was responsible for the eGovernment programme <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/praktisch/digitale-werkplek/programma-vlaanderen-radicaal-digitaal"><em>Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaal</em></a> (Radically digital Flanders), an investment programme that ran from 2015 till 2017. The programme substantially increased the digital maturity of the Flemish government digital service provision. It also ensured that the Once-Only data collection principle (known in Flanders as the MAGDA principle) was adopted by the whole Flemish administration. In 2021, a follow-up investment programme, <a href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/uw-overheid/werking-en-structuur/hoe-werkt-de-vlaamse-overheid/informatie-en-communicatie/vlaanderen-radicaal-digitaal-ii"><em>Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaal II</em></a>, has been launched that will again invest EUR 30 million in the creation of a state-of-the-art digital government.</p><p>The main responsibility of the Flanders Information Agency is to determine the strategic aims and priorities for the transformation of the Flemish government into a data-driven government, while taking part in eGovernment projects in an advisory and supportive role. The agency is also in charge of developing eGovernment-related knowledge and skills, coordinating and providing incentives, and creating a generic eGovernment infrastructure to facilitate cooperation among the different entities within the Flemish administration. This generic eGovernment infrastructure consisted of a number of eGovernment building blocks (electronic identification and trust services, electronic documents, eProcurement, authentic sources, etc.) that can be used as shared systems to improve existing (electronic) service delivery and streamline government operations. The agency provides additional funding for cross-departmental eGovernment projects (<em><a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/radicaal-digitaal">Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaal</a> II</em> projects).</p><p>A key policy element in this eGovernment policy is the continued development of authentic sources of information (base registries). These are databases that can be used to obtain complete, correct and up-to-date data on businesses, natural persons, addresses, plots, buildings, maps, etc. A comprehensive system of Flemish authentic data sources and related services is still in the process of being built. </p><p>The Flemish eGovernment strategy 2014&#x2212;2019 aimed to &#x2018;radically digitally&#x2019; transform the Flemish administration, by opting for a digital-first approach in the (increasingly mobile) delivery of new (or existing) Flemish government services. The new Flemish eGovernment strategy 2019&#x2212;2024 aims to turn the Flemish government into a state-of-the-art digital government, by becoming more data-driven and further adopting the Once-Only principle to proactively deliver digital services to citizens and enterprises.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eGovernment Strategy of the Brussels-Capital Region</p><p>In May 2014, after the elections, the government <a href="http://www.parlbruparl.irisnet.be/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Accord-de-majorite-REG-FR.pdf">unveiled its policy</a>. Highlights included:</p><ul><li>Brussels Smart City: make Brussels the digital capital;</li><li>progressing as much as possible in terms of online administrative management;</li><li>hotspots at every public transport stop; and</li><li>extension and simplification of Irisbox, the regional one-stop-shop.</li></ul><p>In July 2019, the Brussels government brought forward the <a href="http://www.parlement.brussels/texte-de-la-declaration-de-politique-generale-du-gouvernement-bruxellois/">new policy</a> that, among other digital measures, seeks to address inequalities and poverty by automatically granting derivative rights resulting from the social status of the citizens. Furthermore, the new policy includes an entire section on the ambition of the Brussels Region to become a smart city. The transition towards becoming a smart city has multiple purposes:</p><ul><li>to democratise the access to digital wealth;  </li><li>to improve the quality, the performance and the synergies across public services;</li><li>to reduce the costs and the consumption of available resources; and</li><li>to streamline and improve the interactions between citizens and public administration. </li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategic Plan of the Steering Organization of the Flemish Information and ICT Policy</p><p>In June 2020, a new <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/digitale-overheid/stuurorgaan-vlaams-informatie-en-ict-beleid/stuurorgaan-vlaams-informatie-en-ict">Strategic Plan</a> of the Steering Organization of the Flemish Information and ICT Policy was adopted by the Flemish government (VR 2020 2606 DOC.0643/1). The plan outlines the priorities with regards to information and ICT policy for the Flemish administration and local authorities for the period 2020&#x2212;2024. The plan also implements the <em>Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaa</em>l II Investment Programme which will be used from 2021 on to pursue the objectives of this strategic plan. The management and follow-up of the Strategic Plan is under the responsibility of the Steering Body of the Flemish Information and ICT Policy.

The first-generation G-Cloud services became operative in March 2015 and many improvements are still being implemented.</p><p>The G-Cloud is a hybrid cloud service which uses services provided by private companies operating in public cloud environments and services hosted in government datacentres. The G-Cloud is managed by the government. Its expansion and operational functioning largely rely on private sector services. </p><p>The G-Cloud services operate in four different domains. The services offer is gradually being extended and improved, based on the actual needs of the participating institutions. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IAAS), Platform-as-a-Service (PAAS) and Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) are all included. The G-Cloud programme will also encompass synergy initiatives undertaken by the government in the field of classic ICT. New services will be added upon availability. </p><p>&apos;Hard&apos; infrastructure services ensure that government applications are able to run in a reliable physical environment including data-centre housing, servers and storage. The complete virtual capacity can be flexibly modified in a fully managed IAAS environment. These services are supplemented by a soft infrastructure, which allows for high-quality back-ups, security and identity as well as authorisation management. </p><p>PAAS services mainly focus on developing the new software generation, namely cloud-enabled and cloud-native applications using the latest architecture. Generic online applications via Software-as-a-Service for translations, document management, website management and IT service management, among others, are a priority.  </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">European Infrastructure for Blockchain Services</p><p>Belnet is actively participating in the construction of and will co-organise a series of events in 2021, with the aim of informing and meeting the Belgian blockchain community.

The decree incorporated previously separate decrees on the Steering Committee for Flemish Information and ICT policy, on electronic intergovernmental data exchange and on the re-use of public sector information. </p><p>This decree, amongst other topics, dedicated extensive attention to the use of base registries and the adoption of the Once-Only principle by Flemish as well as local administrations. The decree defined the criteria for the recognition of Flemish base registries and specified how to manage them. It introduced the once only obligation to use base registries in Flemish administrative processes (citizens may refuse to give their data more than once), with the obligation to notify back any errors found in these base registries. The decree is now being adapted to take into account the new obligations introduced by <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1024" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information</a><span resource="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1024" property="eli:title" content="Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information"/>.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on Public Procurement and Several Public Works Contracts, Public Supply Contracts and Public Service Contracts </p><p>The <a href="https://www.publicprocurement.be/fr/documents/loi-du-17-juin-2016" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law of 17 June 2016 on Public Procurement</a><span resource="https://www.publicprocurement.be/fr/documents/loi-du-17-juin-2016" property="eli:title" content="Law of 17 June 2016 on Public Procurement"/>, published in the Belgian Monitor of 14 July 2016, was last amended by the <a href="https://www.publicprocurement.be/sites/default/files/documents/2019_04_07_loi_wet_fact_elec_3.pdf" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law of 7 April 2019</a><span resource="https://www.publicprocurement.be/sites/default/files/documents/2019_04_07_loi_wet_fact_elec_3.pdf" property="eli:title" content="Law of 7 April 2019"/>. The changes concerned the inclusion of the definition of eInvoice as well as its essential elements. The new law provided several amendments to the third chapter of the Law of 17 June 2016 concerning Concession Contracts. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing Legislation</p><p>In Belgium, the responsible entity for eInvoicing is the Federal Public Service Policy. However, other public services at federal and regional levels may share part of the responsibility. </p><p>There is no overall legislation in place for the country as a whole. In Flanders, B2G eInvoicing is mandatory for regional contracting authorities. At federal level, the Law of 7 April 2019, published in the Belgian Monitor of 16 April 2019 and transposing Directive 2014/55 into national law, requires contracting authorities to receive and process electronic invoices, following the European standard. </p><p>Despite not being mandatory, economic operators are encouraged to submit eInvoices, and central, regional as well as local contracting authorities and entities are encouraged to receive them. </p><p>A <a href="https://einvoice.belgium.be/en">website</a> has been created by the federal Agency for administrative simplification to guide enterprises, private persons and governments through the concept of electronic invoicing and its future applications.</p><p>In 2016, the European Interoperability Framework PEPPOL was implemented in Belgium, with the Directorate-General Digital Transformation of Federal Public Service Policy and Support (FPS P&amp;S) taking up the roll of PEPPOL Authority (PA) for Belgium.  </p><p>The central gateway between private and public sectors (B2G) is the <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/mercurius-en-peppol">Mercurius</a> platform, which acts as an electronic mailroom for invoices sent to all Belgian public entities. This platform is accompanied by a web portal, which allows public service suppliers who have not yet adopted e-Invoicing to send their electronic invoices in the required structured format. For the receipt of incoming invoices, the Flemish Region has decided to collaborate with the federal level and to also use the Mercurius platform.</p><p>At federal level, the <a href="https://einvoice.belgium.be/en/article/convert-structured-invoices-pdf-hermes">Hermes Platform</a> will be made available to companies in Belgium. This free tool will allow them to convert electronic XML invoices to PDF format. This should be seen as an incentive to initiate structured exchanges, while waiting for the IT sector to develop the appropriate reception and processing tools and market them in attractive terms.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on the Acceptance of Bids, Information to Candidates and Tenderers, and Time Limits on Public Procurement and Several Public Works Contracts, Public Supply contracts and Public Service Contracts </p><p>The , related to public procurement, was <a href="https://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&amp;la=N&amp;table_name=wet&amp;cn=2013061701">amended</a> several times over the last few years. </p><p>It transposed into Belgian law the EU Directives on public procurement, the Directive 2014/25/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and repealing Directive 2004/17/EC, Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC, and Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the award of concession contracts. They defined the use of electronic tools in public procurement and concession contracts, such as electronic publications of tender opportunities, electronic accessibility of procurement documents, electronic submissions of tenders, acceptance of electronic invoices and electronic means of procurement as having the same legal value as that of traditional means. In addition, they defined new concepts based on public procurement directives, more specifically electronic auctions and the Dynamic Purchasing System. </p><h2>Domain-Specific Legislation</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Decree on Primary Care</p><p>The new <a href="http://docs.vlaamsparlement.be/pfile?id=1475222">Decree on Primary Care</a>, which was adopted by the plenary on 3 April 2019, laid down the provisions for the organisation of primary care in Flanders and introduced a digital care and support plan for patients.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><p><img src="../html/img/35-483.jpeg" alt="A picture containing outdoor, sky, flag

WebDIV is an IT application developed by the Federal Public Service Mobility and Transport enabling insurance companies, agents, brokers and leasing companies to register their clients&#x2019; cars online. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal Public Service of Economy </p><p>The Federal Public Service of Economy is responsible for the coordination of the Crossroad Bank for Enterprises Registry, which handles master data for business. The Crossroads Bank for Enterprises (CBE) is an authentic source of information that stores all basic data regarding enterprises and their individual business locations. It incorporates data from the former National Registry of legal entities, the former Trade Registry, the VAT Registry, and the social security administration. It is kept up to date by the authorised organisations that input the data. All the existing data from the above-mentioned sources was combined by the Federal Public Service Economy in the CBE, which provides a truly centralised &#x2018;crossroad&#x2019; of data on companies. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">(Federal) Social Security </p><p>The (Federal) Social Security is responsible for the coordination of the CBSS. The CBSS Registry is complementary and subsidiary to the National Registry. Over the past seventeen years, a major business process re-engineering and computerisation effort has been undertaken by about 3&#xa0;000 Belgian public and private actors in the social sector from different levels (national, regional and local), under the coordination of the CBSS. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal Public Service of Finance&#x2019;s National Property Documentation Centre</p><p>The National Property Documentation Centre is responsible for the coordination of the Land Registry, which handles master data for land and parcels. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Audit</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Court of Audit</p><p>The <a href="http://www.courdescomptes.be/">Court of Audit</a> is a body of the Belgian Parliament. It exerts external control on the budgetary, accounting and financial operations of the Federal State, the regions, the communities, the provinces (but not the municipalities), as well as any institution depending on them. It can therefore scrutinise ICT and eGovernment-related projects.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Parliamentary Committees</p><p>At federal level, the ICT and eGovernment-related projects are examined by the Committee for General and Home Affairs, the Civil Service of the <a href="http://www.lachambre.be/">House of Representatives</a> and the Committee for Home and Administrative affairs of the <a href="http://www.senate.be/">Senate</a>.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Data Protection</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Data Protection Authority </p><p>Since 25 May 2018, the <a href="https://www.dataprotectionauthority.be/">Data Protection Authority (DPA)</a> has replaced the Commission for the Protection of Privacy (Privacy Commission).

The objective was to simplify the way citizens and businesses communicated and interacted with the administration. The information, available in Dutch, English, French and German, is displayed in a more user-friendly manner, according to the main life events of both citizens and businesses. Apart from this new user-centric presentation, a powerful search engine allows to perform searches not only within the portal, but also outside of it.

The Belgian eID thus gives access to restricted online services making Internet use safer by providing an online means of identification and enables the electronic submission of official documents as well as other related services. The national registry number, that is the unique identification number for Belgian citizens, appears on the eID card and its microchip. It is used as unique identifier in the certificate of the eID card.</p><p>It is to be noted that almost all of the electronic signature applications in the Belgian eGovernment sector make use of the Belgian eID card.

Since then, all public authorities of the regional government of Flanders have been able to digitally sign documents in a legal way via the platform. More specifically, the platform converts the files it receives into ready-to-sign PDF documents which can be distributed to and signed by the various parties using their Belgian electronic identity cards (eID). Citizens, businesses and the external partners of the Flemish government benefit from many advantages such as legal validity, user friendliness, the possibility of signing by multiple parties, support for different document formats, open standards and a greener ICT.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Certificates</p><p>The commercial certification authorities&apos; <a href="http://www.belgianchambers.be/en/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="certificates" resource="http://www.belgianchambers.be/en/">certificates</a> can be used in a number of eGovernment applications, as an alternative to eID card signatures. Since 2007, the federal government has recognised three private certification authorities complying with the required standards regarding qualified certificates, as defined in the Belgian eSignatures Act. Their certificates were used for certain eGovernment applications, in particular tax and social security eServices. Like the eID, these digital certificates contained certain identity data, the public key connected with the certificate holder, the public key usage, the validity and the category of the certificate. They were issued to natural persons and legal entities. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Biometric Passports</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ITSME Mobile Application</p><p>This <a href="https://www.passezaudigital.be/croissance-itsme" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="mobile application" resource="https://www.passezaudigital.be/croissance-itsme">mobile application</a> allows citizens to securely authenticate themselves before accessing various digital public services. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Keys</p><p><a href="https://iamapps.belgium.be/sma/generalinfo?view=home" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="digital keys" resource="https://iamapps.belgium.be/sma/generalinfo?view=home">Digital Keys</a> provided by CSAM allow citizens and businesses to securely log in to various platforms and website offering public services.
