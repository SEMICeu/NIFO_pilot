The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Tech.gouv</p><p>On 16&#xa0;April 2019, the French government launched <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/actualites/tech-gouv-accelerer-la-transformation-numerique-du-service-public/">Tech.gouv</a>, a new programme led by the Interministerial Digital Directorate (DINUM), with the support of all Ministries, which aims to speed up the digital transformation of public services. This agile and collaborative programme aims to help the State seize the opportunities offered by digital technologies to improve public services and bring the administration closer to citizens, businesses and civil servants. Tech.gouv addresses six priority issues: simplification, inclusion, attractiveness, command, economies and alliances. The strategy is structured around eight missions: </p><ul><li>Four missions related to digital products and services to develop new uses (labelling, digital identity, data and infrastructure); and</li><li>Four missions related to the promotion of digital expertise to accelerate public service transformation (pilot, talents, factory and transformation).</li></ul><p>Tech.gouv is accompanied by a three-year action plan centred on 35 priority projects and actions.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Strategy for an Inclusive Digital Society</p><p>In September 2018, the <a href="https://societenumerique.gouv.fr/plannational/">National Strategy for an Inclusive Digital Society and the initiative Digital in Common(s)</a> were launched on the occasion of the first event bringing together all actors of digital mediation. The objective is to train 1.5 million people in digital literacy to reduce inequalities and provide equal opportunities for all throughout the country. With 13 million French people who still do not use the internet, or only to a limited extent, including 6.7 million who never connect to the internet, the Government faces a real challenge to carry out the digital transformation of the State. The National Strategy is based on four main approaches:</p><ul><li>Detecting audiences struggling with digital technology;</li><li>Offering human support in the process;</li><li>Training those who wish to do so thanks to the Digital Pass; and</li><li>Strengthening the players in digital mediation.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Action 2022 </p><p>The <a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/action-publique-2022-pour-une-transformation-du-service-public" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Public Action 2022</a><span resource="http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/action-publique-2022-pour-une-transformation-du-service-public" property="dct:title" content="Public Action 2022"/> programme was launched in September 2017 by the French Prime Minister &#xc9;douard Philippe, with the aim to modernise the State. The programme has three objectives: (i) improving the quality of public service provided to the user; (ii) improving the working conditions of staff, and (iii) helping to control the budget. To achieve these objectives, the government developed a National Strategy for the Transformation of Public Action, published during the <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/action-publique-2022/actualites/un-2eme-comite-interministeriel-de-la-transformation-publique-ce-quil-faut-retenir">second meeting of the Interministerial Committee for Public Transformation</a> in October 2018. The Strategy includes precise and quantifiable indicators to measure and report on the success of the programme. French citizens will thus be able to monitor the progress of the reforms. The ambition is to have a closer, simpler and more efficient State to better meet citizens&apos; expectations, with transparency in monitoring being a guarantee of the success of reforms.</p><p>The National Strategy is based on four streams guiding the government&apos;s action: </p><ul><li>Public services closer to users;</li><li>Simpler and more accessible approaches;</li><li>Clearer and more effective public intervention; and</li><li>A State that transforms itself.</li></ul><p>A considerable part of the action in the field involves digital solutions, thus contributing to the promotion and development of digital government. </p><p>In June 2019, the Prime Minister launched the second part of the initiatives aimed at public transformation, inspired by citizens&#x2019; contributions to the &#x2018;<em>Grand d&#xe9;bat national&#x2019;, </em>a public consultation conducted earlier in the year. This second part is centred on three priority commitments: (i) a simpler and more responsive administrative organisation; (ii) closer and more accessible administrations, and (iii) a more efficient administration, able to leverage digital tools for the benefit of end-users, public servants and public policies.</p><p>This over-arching strategy has been implemented by each Ministry through ministerial transformation plans that define the modalities for implementing major government reforms (milestones, achievements and impact indicators). The monitoring of the implementation of these reforms is carried out by the Interministerial Directorate for Public Transformation (DITP), alongside the Offices of the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic, and takes the form of high-level follow-up meetings scheduled at regular intervals. Since the programme&#x2019;s launch, six Interministerial Committees for Public Transformation have been organised, the latest one having taken place in July 2021, with <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/transformation-publique/comites-interministeriels-de-la-transformation-publique/article-citp">renewed commitments for the State&#x2019;s digital transformation</a>. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministerial Transformation Plans</p><p>Following the roadmap that the Prime Minister sent to each member of the government at the beginning of his term of office, each Minister has now drawn up a <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/action-publique-2022/plans-de-transformation/les-plans-de-transformation-ministeriels">Ministerial Transformation Plan</a>, for which he/she is responsible, to ensure the implementation of the main reforms. After the design and trade-off phase, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Interministerial Committee for the Transformation of Public Action (CITP) was meant to accelerate the implementation of the Ministries&apos; roadmaps and their Transformation Plans. These plans are monitored at the highest level to ensure that the reforms undertaken are translated into concrete results. The ambition is to have a closer, simpler and more efficient State to better meet citizens&apos; expectations.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Ministerial Digital Transformation Plans </p><p>As part of the <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/laction-publique-se-transforme/avec-les-administrations-et-les-operateurs-publics/action-publique-2022" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Public Action 2022</a><span resource="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/laction-publique-se-transforme/avec-les-administrations-et-les-operateurs-publics/action-publique-2022" property="dct:title" content="Public Action 2022"/> initiative, the Minister for the Armed Forces defined a roadmap in 2017 setting three objectives for the digital transformation of the Ministry:</p><ul><li>Ensure operational superiority and information literacy in theatres of operations;</li><li>Strengthen the efficiency of support and facilitate the daily lives of staff; and</li><li>Improve the relationship with citizens and the attractiveness of the Ministry.</li></ul><p>This Ministerial Digital Transformation Plan was the first to be presented and sets out actions in a concrete way, as the Minister for the Armed Forces reminded: &#x201c;After four months of work, we are now entering the action phase. This plan offers concrete measures to fully achieve our objectives and address the digital transformation&#x201d;.</p><p>At the same time, the education system is engaged in profound <a href="https://www.education.gouv.fr/cid133192/le-numerique-service-ecole-confiance.html">pedagogical and organisational transformations</a>, from nursery schools to higher education, requiring to thoroughly take advantage of the potential of digital technology. Digital technology represents a powerful lever for transformation to support ministerial policy in all its dimensions, which are: (i) the pedagogical transformation, digital technology being at the service of learning and evaluation; (ii) training in the challenges and professions of tomorrow; (iii) simplification of relations with users, and (iv) modernisation of the functioning of the State with redesigned information systems. In addition, today, the Ministry of National Education, Youth and Sport produces a very large amount of data related to school life, student assessments and results, and work and homework performed by students. A wide variety of personal digital data is collected, stored and processed by a multitude of actors (schools and educational institutions, academic services, local authorities, and private partners providing educational resources and digital services). In this context, the Ministry must ensure that the flow, processing and storage of school data strictly respects the privacy of students and their families, teachers and administrative staff. </p><p>Digital Transformation of Territories Programme</p><p>In 2021, the <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/services/tnt/#contenu">Digital Transformation of Territories (TNT) programme</a> has replaced the former Concerted Development of Territorial Digital Transformation (DCANT) programme, which ended in 2020. TNT is a cooperation programme between the central government and local authorities to address the challenges of digital transformation within local authorities, and also to support the development of appropriate and efficient public services. This programme, managed by DINUM, includes a series of actions at the national, regional and local levels. It is steered by the Ministry of Public Sector Transformation and the Civil Service, the Ministry for Territorial Cohesion and Relations with Local Government and associations representing local authorities of all sizes and levels.</p><p>In particular, the programme allows for the emergence of common tools and concrete solutions that can be reused by all local levels wishing to move forward on digital. These tools and solutions are co-constructed within project groups led by the central government and local authorities and address various digital transformation issues (data, cybersecurity, training of elected officials in digital issues, dematerialization projects that are the responsibility of local authorities, etc.). These project groups deal with digital issues in a cross-cutting manner and take into account all regulatory obligations and potential organizational and technical issues.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Roadmap for the Digital Economy</p><p>Following a workshop on the digital economy organised on 28&#xa0;February 2013, the government presented the Government Roadmap for the Digital Economy. This strategy revolves around three pillars, namely: &#x2018;Providing opportunities for youth&#x2019;, &#x2018;Reinforcing competitiveness&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Promoting French values in society&#x2019;.</p><p><strong>Providing opportunities for Youth</strong></p><p>Four objectives were defined under this pillar:</p><ul><li>Using digital tools to rethink education in schools, i.e. ensure that all students leaving school are familiar with digital tools, have followed courses in information and media, and are aware of the historical, cultural, artistic, economic and social challenges brought about by the information society;</li><li>Creating more digitally accessible universities, i.e. ensure that distance learning programmes and diplomas can be obtained in all fields where this is possible, and that 20% of educational programmes are available through digital means;</li><li>Promoting ICT related jobs, as to increase the number of graduates obtaining ICT related degrees by at least 3,000 per year; and</li><li>Reinforcing awareness-raising campaigns. </li></ul><p><strong>Reinforcing competitiveness</strong></p><p>Four objectives were defined under this pillar:</p><ul><li>Encouraging the development of global digital companies;</li><li>Encouraging research and innovation;</li><li>Guaranteeing digital take-up for the entire economy; and</li><li>Developing a 21<sup>st</sup> century infrastructure. </li></ul><p><strong>Promoting French values in society</strong></p><p>Six objectives were defined under this pillar:</p><ul><li>Encouraging the use of digital tools to tackle exclusion;</li><li>Protecting French sovereignty and establishing a trustful environment for citizens;</li><li>Defining a new digital pact to promote cultural activities;</li><li>Modernising public policy through the use of digital tools and resources;</li><li>Promoting the use of digital means in the health sector; and</li><li>Responding to cyberspace-related challenges.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">&#x2018;State Start-up&#x2019; Strategy</p><p>Since 2013, the <a href="https://beta.gouv.fr/">Beta.gouv mission/programme</a> within DINUM has been helping French administrations design useful and easily usable digital public services. The method proposed by the programme is based on two pillars:</p><ul><li>Developing digital services centred on users&apos; needs and continuously improving them based on the feedback received from those who used the service; and</li><li>Supporting civil servants with strong business expertise to project themselves as product managers and, accompanied by a small technical team (1 or 2 developers maximum), to directly manage the development of digital-native public policies. </li></ul><p>This process, called the <a href="https://www.fondapol.org/etude/pierre-pezziardi-et-henri-verdier-des-startups-detat-a-letat-plateforme/">&#x2018;State Startup&#x2019; method</a>, is an adaptation of the &#x2018;Lean Startup&#x2019; method, which is popular in entrepreneurial circles, to public administrations. It is an interesting alternative to the traditional IT development cycle (known as the &quot;Waterfall cycle&quot;), allowing for a more exploratory approach and prioritising the search for impact. This method is particularly suited for the creation of digital services for individuals. Supported by DINUM, this method has spread to various administrations, which have gradually created digital service &quot;incubators&quot; and set up various actions to identify civil servants who volunteer to take on the role of &#x2018;digital entrepreneurs&#x2019; and/or to identify public policy problems that can be addressed by creating impact-oriented digital services. </p><p>The Beta.gouv programme is now a genuine network of digital innovators within the State, trained in &#x2018;lean product management&#x2019; methods and contributing to a collective learning community. There are now 16 such incubators, dealing with business issues as diverse as those encountered by the Ministry for the Armed Forces, the Ministry of Justice, the French Employment Agency (P&#xf4;le Emploi) and the National Agency for Territorial Cohesion (to name just four partner institutions). </p><p>The Beta.gouv community, the backbone of the programme, reached 800 members in 2022.

From creation to transfer, the PACTE removes obstacles, simplifying business creation and easing workforce thresholds. In particular, entrepreneurs&#x2019; lives will be simplified thanks to the creation of a single online platform for business formalities. The PACTE is a new step in the country&apos;s economic transformation and the fourth phase of the economic reforms initiated by the government more than two years ago.

Moreover, the PACTE acts in parallel with the Law on the Freedom to Choose One&apos;s Professional Future to give small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the means to create jobs. The PACTE is the result of a co-construction process initiated with companies, parliamentarians, and local authorities in October 2017.

The ANCT can facilitate the implementation of various types of projects, including broadband coverage and WiFi installation in public places, and carries out various national programmes, some of which related, for instance, to digital inclusion issues.</p><p/><p>	 Digital Public Administration Infrastructure </p><p>6</p><h1>Digital Public Administration Infrastructure </h1><h2>Portals</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">National portals</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">&#x2018;Tell-Us-Once&#x2019; Principle: Continuous Enhancement of the API Catalogue</p><p>DINUM created a unique point of entry to have access to <a href="https://api.gouv.fr/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="all public apis" resource="https://api.gouv.fr/">all public APIs</a>. This <a href="https://api.gouv.fr" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="catalogue of apis" resource="https://api.gouv.fr">catalogue of APIs</a> is primarily intended for service creators and API consumers and aims to facilitate the discovery and understanding of APIs, and the access to APIs and their producers. At the same time, the catalogue enables suppliers to easily publicise their APIs. </p><p>Administrations often consume several APIs (from different producers) to implement a teleservice or a new approach. The use of an interdepartmental tool allows them to ensure consistency in the authorisation procedure and centralise their requests.</p><p>To facilitate the lives of data providers, DINUM developed a specific tool to manage the authorisation phase, called &#x2018;DataPass&#x2019;. Furthermore, DINUM created two API hubs, namely <a href="https://entreprise.api.gouv.fr/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="api enterprise" resource="https://entreprise.api.gouv.fr/">API Enterprise</a> and <a href="https://api.gouv.fr/les-api/api-particulier" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="api particulier" resource="https://api.gouv.fr/les-api/api-particulier">API Particulier</a>.</p><p><strong>DataPass</strong></p><p>DINUM worked on setting up a common legal framework to harmonise and streamline relations between data providers and service providers through the construction of DataPass, a tool facilitating the connection between suppliers and consumers. This tool is intended for stakeholders (e.g. public administrations) who wish to use personal data. DataPass delivers authorisations through a simple, standardised and compliant process, to access all protected data produced by the State.</p><p>For the stakeholders requesting access to data, DataPass contains the following features: </p><ul><li>APIs centralising authorisations stemming from public administrations (available as well for any other type of organisations, both public and private);</li><li>Single account to access API managers and request access to the DataPass tool (SSO);</li><li>Management of authorisations to access API; and</li><li>Email notification from the Data Protection Officer and the data controller of the users&#x2019; organisation when a request has been validated.</li></ul><p>For the data controller:</p><ul><li>Email notification for each new access request;</li><li>Automation of the creation of API manager access accounts;</li><li>Automation of token creation through interaction with the API manager;</li><li>Publication of validated authorisations on <a href="https://datapass.api.gouv.fr/public" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="datapass" resource="https://datapass.api.gouv.fr/public">DataPass</a> in accordance with the GDPR; and</li><li>Activity management / <a href="https://datapass.api.gouv.fr/stats" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="statistical dashboard" resource="https://datapass.api.gouv.fr/stats">statistical dashboard</a>. </li></ul><p><strong>API Entreprise</strong></p><p>Digital technology enables the pre-filling and digitisation of administrative forms that businesses are required to complete, in particular to enable the exchange of information between the different departments and agencies.
