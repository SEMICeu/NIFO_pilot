The order introduced the principle of State as a service. The principle aims to develop a new digital infrastructure and enhance the accessibility to public eServices for citizens and businesses. The Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine developed and implemented single requirements for the State service delivery system. These requirements included indicators on efficiency, maximum waiting time and user satisfaction. The order mandated State authorities to gradually digitise their services and publish quarterly reports on these activities. In addition, the order stated the necessity to develop a State customer support system for the most frequently used State services (e.g. pension and social insurance, issuing of ID cards, registration of private enterprises and legal entities, vehicle registration, issuing of driver licenses).&#xa0;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Presidential order No. 558/2019 on Some Activities to Enhance the Access to State eServices for Citizens and Businesses&#xa0;</p><p>On 29 July 2019, the President of Ukraine issued <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/558/2019" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Order No. 558/2019 on some Activities to Enhance the Access to State eServices for Citizens and Businesses.</a><span resource="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/558/2019" property="eli:title" content="Order No. 558/2019 on some Activities to Enhance the Access to State eServices for Citizens and Businesses."/> The order addresses both operational and data protection issues of State registries. Additionally, it improves the accessibility of eServices for citizens and businesses while eliminating corruption risks resulting from the delivery of such services. The order states the necessity to conduct an audit of public information resources, including the analysis of legislation framework, technical capacities and the level of registry protection. Following the results of the audit, the responsible State bodies have to implement the single unique identifier of physical persons (unique registration number), to verify data in the State Demographic Registry and to ensure the electronic interaction between the registries with the final aim of minimising the number of personal inquiries to State bodies. Also, the order obliges to develop a Diia State eServices Portal that will provide eServices to physical persons and legal entities based on the one-stop-shop principle.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Decree No. 56 on Some Questions of Digital Development </p><p>On 30 January 2019, the government approved a decree on <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/56-2019-ÃÂ¿">Some Questions of Digital Development</a>, which defined the digital-by-default principle. It emphasised key principles such as the mobile-first principle, necessity of eParticipation, digital inclusion and engagement. The implementation of the digital-by-default policy models the joint approach for the access to services via the internet, free-of-charge integration, management of electronic information resources, administration of security questions and data protection. Thus, State entities save time, reduce spending on service delivery, increase transparency and improve the quality of services provided to citizens and businesses.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law of Ukraine No. 4355 On State Demographic Registry and Documents that Confirm Ukrainian Citizenship or Identify the Person</p><p>In March 2021, the <em>Verkhovna Rada</em> of Ukraine (Ukrainian Parliament) adopted <a href="http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=70393" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law No. 4355 On State Demographic Registry and Documents that Confirm Ukrainian Citizenship or Identify People</a><span resource="http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=70393" property="eli:title" content="Law No. 4355 On State Demographic Registry and Documents that Confirm Ukrainian Citizenship or Identify People"/>, which legally regulates digital ID cards in the Diia mobile app. Starting from 23 August 2021, digital national and international ID cards which are available on the Diia mobile app will have the same legal power as paper-based documents and can be legally used to identify people.

It is a single database of administrative services designed to provide full and accurate information about public services. Previously, there was no clear understanding of the actual number of public services available or how to obtain them. Moreover, a single service could go by different names, and State authorities could demand different documents from citizens in order to provide the same service. This would create opportunities for petty corruption and waste citizens&#x2019; time and resources. Each service in the registry is assigned a unique code that is used when users receive services through the Diia portal and in ASCs. </p><p>When necessary, the registry also allows administrators to insert or edit the service description, and the registry contains a search function based on classifiers (i.e. categories, State entities, documents, results, life events, grounds for refusal). Currently, the guide contains information on over 1,600 public services (including electronic and paper-based services). The data on these services is divided into 17 categories of business activities and is arranged among 36 life events (e.g. starting a business, changing your place of residence, having a baby, or buying a vehicle; you can find all the information about where to obtain these services, their price, terms, etc. in the guide). The guide provides citizens and businesses with easily searchable and credible information about the services as well as how to obtain them.&#x202f;&#x202f;</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Diia.Business Platform</p><ul><li>A catalogue of business ideas with convenient templates and a list of all the necessary legal documents to start a business; </li><li>Information on services and support programs for businesses;</li><li>Guides and handbooks for entrepreneurs;</li><li>Success stories of people that have already started their business; and</li><li>A consulting area.
