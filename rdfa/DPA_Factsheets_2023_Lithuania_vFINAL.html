According to the programme, one of the priorities in the field of digitalisation is consolidating State information resources, as well as IT infrastructure and services. To that end, the programme ensures further consolidation of the State&#x2019;s information resources infrastructure, as well as the interoperability of State information resources. </p><p>Concerning the National Interoperability Framework (NIF), no formal document focuses on it in Lithuania. However, the country has integrated its approach towards interoperability in the <a href="https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/13206c504e8d11ec862fdcbc8b3e3e05">State Digitalisation Development Programme for 2021&#x2013;2030</a>, in the Law on the State Information Resources Management and in the State Information Resources Interoperability Platform (SIRIP). SIRIP is the multifunctional platform ensuring the provision of public and administrative electronic services on a &#x2018;one-stop-shop&#x2019; basis through a central eGovernment portal and seeking to achieve the State information resources&#x2019; functional, technical and semantic interoperability. It provides data exchange, person identification in the electronic space, payment of State fees or other charges for the provision of public and administrative services, and eService design services to institutions.</p><h2>Key Enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Data Opening</p><p>Data opening, one of the strategic goals of the Lithuanian State, was put forward in the <a href="https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/13206c504e8d11ec862fdcbc8b3e3e05">State Digitalisation Development Programme for 2021&#x2013;2030</a>. Furthermore, data are a top priority also in the Lithuanian new government&#x2019;s four-year programme, approved at the end of 2020. According to the programme, data are the cornerstone of the government&#x2019;s decisions and communication. </p><p>The Ministry of Economy and Innovation, which defines the open data policy in accordance with the recommendations of the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), ensures that the provisions of the EU legal acts on open data and reuse of public sector information are implemented in the programme.</p><p>Lithuania has reached tangible results in amending legislation in this regard. The legal amendments address obligations on opening relevant data, and seek to increase reuse of publicly funded information and to bring the legislative framework up to date with the advances in digital technologies. Amendments to the Law on the Right to Receive Information and Reuse of Data entered into force in July 2021, transposing the provisions of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information, and establishing a data opening model which obliges institutions to inventory their data to know what data are owned by the State and open data on user demand. The data opening model also establishes a centralised data opening scheme, which should significantly speed up the data opening process. Datasets of State institutions are processed and opened centrally through the State Data Management Information System managed by Statistics Lithuania. Data opening is currently being harmonised, focusing on automated processes and on establishing an organisational structure in the institutions. All public bodies are obliged to appoint a person responsible for organising the opening of the authority&#x2019;s data, the &#x2018;open data coordinator&#x2019;. The designated coordinator has to ensure that the process of opening data is carried out, together with its supervision and compliance with the requirements laid down in the legislation.  </p><p>According to the Open Data Maturity Report 2022, Lithuania is a fast-tracker in the field of open data and was ranked 13<sup>th</sup> among 34 countries. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.&#xa0;</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Cybersecurity Strategy </p><p>The <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Cybersecurity/Documents/National_Strategies_Repository/LRV+818+National+Cyber+Security+Strategy+(Lithuania).pdf">National Cybersecurity Strategy</a> was adopted on 13 August 2018 via Resolution No. 818 of the government of the Republic of Lithuania.

By submitting this information, stakeholders confirm that the operator itself or the members of its management/supervisory bodies, and the beneficial owners are familiar with the legal acts governing the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and meet their requirements. The data processor of the Register of Legal Entities also checks whether a legal entity established in the Republic of Lithuania, whose legal form is a public or private limited liability company, intending to carry out the activities of a virtual currency exchange operator and/or a depository virtual currency wallet operator has registered the authorised capital, amounting to at least EUR 125&#xa0;000.

It enables the exchange of such data among patients, healthcare professionals and institutions. The ESPBI IS strives to ensure a higher level of patient awareness about health and a more effective use of available resources for the provision of healthcare services, and seeks to base those services on modern technologies.</p><p>The structure of the ESPBI IS is based on a repository database, which consists of separate databases of patient electronic health records (EHRs), medical devices, classifiers, medical images, ePrescriptions, as well as reports and statistical information. </p><p>The ESPBI IS has been created as a single data centre which stores the medical records of each resident (patient) and also allows to integrate data from all internal information systems of healthcare institutions into a unified system. For the smaller healthcare institutions that do not own internal information systems, a special eHealth portal has been developed. Authorised healthcare professionals can now provide the required patient data to the central EHR database or other ESPBI IS databases through their computers. This means that patient data can be transferred to the ESPBI IS either directly via a special eHealth portal or by integrating the internal information systems of larger healthcare institutions. </p><p>In 2022, the ESPBI IS served 100% of insured patients who are registered with a primary healthcare institution that has a contract with the Health Insurance Fund. Furthermore, in the same year 99.7% of all reimbursed drugs were prescribed electronically, while 100% of referrals, 97% of inpatient recovery, 100% of out-patient descriptions, 100% of child&#x2019;s birth certificates and medical death certificates, and 97% of driver&#x2019;s medical certificates were provided to the ESPBI IS. </p><p>In 2022, the number of medical records decreased, because the state of emergency was canceled in Lithuania and the number of COVID-19 tests decreased.</p><p>The data stored in the ESPBI IS are also accessible to patients via a special national <a href="http://www.esveikata.lt/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="internet portal" resource="http://www.esveikata.lt/">internet portal</a>. More and more people are visiting the national eHealth portal each year, with unique visits increasing from 6&#xa0;475 to 3&#xa0;619&#xa0;342 between 2019 and 2022. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Social Support and Family Information System</p><p>The <a href="https://www.spis.lt/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="social support and family information system (spis)" resource="https://www.spis.lt/">Social Support and Family Information System (SPIS)</a> is an information system operating under cooperation agreements between the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, and all the country&#x2019;s municipalities. The purpose of SPIS is to uniformly record and accumulate information on social assistance provided in the municipalities (social benefits and compensations, social support for children, social services, activities carried out in the field of children rights protection, etc.), analyse the data by municipalities, types of support and beneficiaries, as well as prevent several municipalities from providing the same benefits at the same time. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Bailiff&#x2019;s Information System </p><p>After the implementation of the project &#x2018;Creation of eServices for Participation in the Enforcement Process, Auctions and Forced Sales Auctions&#x2019; in 2015, the following maturity-level-4 services were worked on: (i) the <a href="https://www.antstoliai.lt/ais2/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="bailiff&#x2019;s information system" resource="https://www.antstoliai.lt/ais2/">Bailiff&#x2019;s Information System</a>, consisting of internal and external portals, was created; (ii) the subsystem of electronic auctions and electronic forced sales auctions (<a href="https://www.evarzytynes.lt/evs/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="eauction" resource="https://www.evarzytynes.lt/evs/">eAuction</a>) was modernised; (iii) the <a href="https://www.antstoliai.lt/vbp/public" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="electronic enforcement file portal" resource="https://www.antstoliai.lt/vbp/public">Electronic Enforcement File Portal</a> was developed; and (iv) the Cash Restrictions Information System was established. </p><p>The Bailiff&#x2019;s Information System assists bailiffs in (i) creating an enforcement file; (ii) checking the financial situation of a debtor in real time; (iii) creating procedural documents; (iv) validating procedural documents with eSignature and sending them to the recipients by electronic means and by post; (v) submitting cash restrictions or write-offs to the Cash Restrictions Information System by electronic means; and (vi) forming and submitting property seizure acts to the Register of Property Seizure Acts by electronic means. The Bailiffs&#x2019; Information System has interfaces with the Tax Accounting System managed by the State Tax Inspectorate under the Ministry of Finance, as well as with the Tax Accounting and Control Information System managed by the Customs Department under the same Ministry. These systems send to the bailiffs, through the Bailiffs&#x2019; Information System, decisions on recovery of tax arrears from property, decisions on recovery of overdue fines imposed for administrative offences from property, decisions to recover pursuant to the request of a foreign State and other decisions on recovery from property. In addition, they also receive the information related to the recovery process from the Bailiffs&#x2019; information system.</p><p>Information about enforcement files, executed legal proceedings and adopted enforcement measures enables the Ministry of Justice, which supervises the activities of bailiffs, to control their activities. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.antstoliai.lt/vbp/public" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="electronic enforcement file portal" resource="https://www.antstoliai.lt/vbp/public">Electronic Enforcement File Portal</a> enables citizens and businesses to (i) participate in the enforcement process; (ii) familiarise with enforcement files, either personal or of an authorised person, as well as with general and financial information; (iii) look through procedural documents; and (iv) form and submit enforcement document applications and other free applications to bailiffs by electronic means. </p><p>The electronic forced sales auctions service allows bailiffs and bankruptcy administrators to announce forced auctions of property by electronic means. This service is used for the electronic sale of State-owned and municipal property organised by the State enterprise <em>Turto Bankas</em>, municipalities and other institutions. This solution ensures higher transparency of public sector solutions and procedures, as well as openness and accountability vis-&#xe0;-vis society, while decreasing the risk of corruption and saving money.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Cash Restrictions Information System</p><p>The <a href="https://www.registrucentras.lt/p/1026" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="cash restrictions information system" resource="https://www.registrucentras.lt/p/1026">Cash Restrictions Information System</a> is an automatically operating information system which enables any institution holding the right to forced recovery to place orders with credit institutions to write off cash and impose restrictions in a uniform approach. The system ensures the sequence of write-offs in accordance with the priority to satisfy the claims and distributes the debtor&#x2019;s funds proportionally to the institutions holding the right to forced recovery. The system allows to control the processes related to debtor cash restrictions and/or write-offs, and ensures effective data exchange among those participating in the cash restrictions process.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-191.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The Ministry of National Defence has taken on the leadership role for Lithuania&#x2019;s overall cyber and electronic security since the beginning of 2018. Furthermore, a unified <a href="https://www.cert.lt/en/">National Cybersecurity Centre</a> has become the main computer emergency response team (CERT), bringing together the Lithuanian public, private, governmental and military spheres. </p><p>In 2019, the Ministry of National Defence established a governmental network, detached from the public internet and encompassing State institutions having functions related to mobilisation. This will ensure that even in the event of a conflict, fundamental State institutions will remain protected and able to exchange information. </p><p>In addition to carrying out national initiatives, Lithuania, represented by the Ministry of National Defence, is a lead nation of the EU&#x2019;s Permanent Structured Cooperation in Security and Defence project called Cyber Rapid Response Teams and Mutual Assistance in Cybersecurity. Together with eleven other EU Member States, Lithuania is creating a common capability to respond to cyberattacks &#x2013; a multinational team with a well-developed cyber toolkit, which will be able to support Member States in times of need.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Agenda Council</p><p>In Lithuania, the field of digitalisation is coordinated by the Digital Agenda Council.

To that end, it runs a structured programme, called GovTech Challenge Series, designed to solve public sector challenges that do not have a clear answer but have a potential to foster the creation of innovative digital solutions, co-created with start-ups and SMEs. The GovTech Lab also works on spreading the knowledge about GovTech and building networks of innovators both within and outside the public sector. The team of GovTech Lab organise community events for both the public and private sectors, from local meetups and training sessions to public sector officials, to international conferences. To build a local GovTech community that could have a global impact, GovTech Lab has also co-founded and run an international network of similar organisations that connects the global GovTech community &#x2013; CivTech Alliance.</p><p/><p>6</p><p>Cross-border Digital </p><p>Public Administration Services </p></div><h1>Cross-border Digital Public Administration Services for Citizens and Businesses</h1><p>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to &#x2018;life and travel&#x2019;, as well as &#x2018;doing business&#x2019; abroad.
