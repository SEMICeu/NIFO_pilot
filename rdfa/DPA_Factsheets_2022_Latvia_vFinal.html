The information is organised according to a life event approach, covering in total 152 life events: life events bring together successive steps for the use of different eSolutions (ICT platforms, eTools and eServices) in one place. These eSolutions enable a person to successfully complete the formalities related to a particular life situation, such as changing residence, changing work, setting up a company and many other situations. The portal has three main functions: information, consultation and access to eProcedures, from basic eDocuments sent by e-mail to advanced, fully automated eServices. </p><p>The most popular eServices are: the E-application for <a href="https://www.vsaa.gov.lv/en" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="state social insurance agency" resource="https://www.vsaa.gov.lv/en">State Social Insurance Agency</a> (SIAA) services; the document check of the Invalid Documents Register; the application to an institution; the account statement for subscribers in the State-funded pension scheme (2<sup>nd</sup> pillar pension); and the payment of the immovable property tax. </p><p>There is a wide range of authentication tools available to access eServices in the State and local government services portal including eID cards, eSignature cards, eSignature Mobile, eIDAS (for cross-border authentication) as well as eight different iBanking authentication tools. The portal also provides the opportunity to carry out ePayment services.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eHealth System</p><p>In the eHealth system, health professionals can: prescribe via ePrescription and give eSick leave certificates; view and add data in a patient&#x2019;s file (diagnoses, allergies and administered drugs); create an eReferral for a specialist consultation or a diagnostic test; prepare medical documents during a consultation, examination or treatment; view medical documents prepared by other doctors; deny a patient the right to view certain medical data; and fill in the patient data in the register for specific diagnoses. Pharmacists can dispense the prescribed medicines, as well as make their own statistical reports.
