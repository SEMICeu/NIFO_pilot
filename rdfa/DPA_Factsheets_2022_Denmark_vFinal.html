The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Public Administration and COVID-19</p><p>The public digital infrastructure has shown its worth during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it has enabled public services to uphold their high level even with a considerable degree of remote work within the State, regions and municipalities. Furthermore, the government has launched a range of new digital services to cope with COVID-19, including a contact-tracing app and the digital booking of tests and vaccines.</p><p>Thanks to digital-ready legislation and an advanced digital infrastructure, the central government was able to process <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/news/2020-11/Case Collection - Reducing administrative burdens with digital-ready legislation.pdf">COVID-19 stimulus checks</a> addressed to 2.2 million recipients in a fully automatic mode and in less than eight days.</p><p>Furthermore, 2.1 million residents were able to digitally apply for and receive early holiday allowance for a total value of approximately EUR 14.5 billion. The first round of the two holiday allowance pay-outs (EUR 7 billion in October 2020) resulted in a monthly increase in retail spending of 8.2% leading to the highest ever consumer spending index in the month of October 2020.</p><p>Finally, businesses were able to apply for the Danish stimulus packages for businesses during the pandemic <a href="https://virksomhedsguiden.dk/content/ydelser/kompensation-til-virksomheder-og-selvstaendige/be51dffe-da7b-4482-8a51-1568f8dc9966/">digitally</a> (<em>i.e.</em> for lost turnover), as the Danish <em>&#x2018;Virksomhedsguiden&#x2019;</em> incorporated a platform for applications and the provision of information before the final settling of accounts in the Danish Business Authority.

The <a href="https://uk.rigsrevisionen.dk/">Guidelines on How to Make Legislation Digital-Ready</a> outline the <a href="http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do">principles</a> and how to apply them in the legislative process. </p><p>Additionally, all proposed legislation must be assessed for potential impacts regarding project risk, organisational changes, data protection and citizens&#x2019; rights. The findings must be described in the legislative proposal together with possible mitigating measures.</p><p>To ensure that legislation is digital-ready, every legislative proposal is screened for compliance with the guidelines and consultation responses are sent to the responsible ministries by a unit established within the Ministry of Finance. Since 2018, approximately 400 consultation responses were sent.</p><p>In support of this approach, a <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">course on digital-ready policymaking</a> is available to legislative drafters and policy officers in government departments.</p><p> </p><p>A report documenting the initiatives results was <a href="https://en.digst.dk/news/news-archive/2021/may/review-new-legislation-enables-responsible-digitisation-to-an-increasing-degree/">published</a> in May 2021. The report concludes among other things that the effort is well under way and that new legislation is increasingly digital-ready. The report however also shows that existing legislation has not been systematically reviewed for digital-readiness. </p><p>As part of the agreement on the Finance Act for 2022, it was decided to continue the work on ensuring that legislation is digital-ready.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategy for ICT Management in Central Government</p><p>A <a href="https://en.digst.dk/policy-and-strategy/strategy-for-ict-management/">Strategy for ICT Management in Central Government</a> was launched on 21 November 2017, aiming to improve the operational management of information and communication technology (ICT) systems. The 13 initiatives forming the framework for a better management of ICT systems address issues such as the mandatory compliance to the central government&#x2019;s ICT system portfolio management model and the periodic review by the National ICT Council of each ministry&#x2019;s ICT system management. The initiatives also address the development of cross-governmental network activities amongst leaders and employees working with digitalisation and developing the technical and professional competencies and skills required to manage ICT.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Common Framework for Public-Sector Digital Architecture (Danish NIF)</p><p>Finally, the FDA encompasses a number of common technical solutions such as the national infrastructure solutions for ID, Digital Signature, Single Sign On and Digital Post, among others.</p><p>The application of the <a href="https://indberet.virk.dk/">general governance structure</a> is voluntary depending on relevance, logic, and business case.

NemID is a central element in the digital infrastructure and is a part of the everyday life of many citizens and businesses. NemID is used to either sign a document digitally or verify a user&#x2019;s identity when entering a self-service. More than 5.3 million citizens aged 15 or more have a personal NemID, and more than half a million companies use NemID to log in to digital self-service solutions (e.g. <a href="https://ast.dk/">Virk</a> and <a href="https://rm.coe.int/16806af0e6">Digital Post</a>) on behalf of the business entity, which makes reporting to the public sector easier. </p><p>NemID is the result of the collaboration between the State, municipalities and regions, the financial sector, and a private contractor. In cooperation with the <a href="https://datafordeler.dk/">Danish Association of the Blind</a>, a special solution was also developed for blind and partially sighted people.</p><p>The MitID business solution (MitID Erhverv) is scheduled to be launched in the second half of 2022 and will enable businesses and their employees to access digital self-service solutions with MitID on behalf of the business entity.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Strategy for Cyber and Information Security</p><p>On 15 December 2021, the government launched  to replace the previous strategy covering the period 2018&#x2212;2021.

The initiatives aim to strengthen security through:</p><ul><li>Robust protection of the key functions of society (16 initiatives);</li><li>Increased level of competencies and management responsibilities (six initiatives);</li><li>Strengthened public-private cooperation (seven initiatives); and </li><li>Active international engagement in the fight against cyberthreats (five initiatives).</li></ul><p>The threats related to cyberespionage and cybercrime are very high and the new national strategy seeks to address them by increasing the level of ambition regarding the efforts of the industry and in relation to the national critical infrastructure and cross-sectoral commitments. The strategy also focuses on increasing the level of the cyber and information security of citizens, businesses, and authorities.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Basic Data Programme</p><p>Established in 2012 and completed in 2019, the <a href="https://en.digst.dk/data-and-it-architecture/basic-data/">Basic Data Programme</a> acted as a driver for growth and efficiency by improving the quality and interconnectivity of Danish base registries. The initial goal of the programme was to create a common distribution platform (the Data Distributor) for easy-to-access, secure, high-quality basic data, whilst ensuring their correctness by increasing the coordination between the different authorities responsible for the base registries. The coordination among base registries continues in the Basic Data organisation.

Regions are now investing in developing and replacing electronic health record systems, and municipalities are radically changing the way they use health data by implementing structured electronic medical records. The strategy creates a foundation for a joint digitalisation effort of the entire Danish health system. By strengthening the digital foundation for providing healthcare across the sector, the strategy &#x2013; when implemented &#x2013; will also strengthen the security of personal health data and enable the safe and secure exchange of relevant data in the health sector.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">White Paper: Towards a Better Social Contract with Tech Giants </p><p>In June 2021, the Danish government published a <a href="https://techamb.um.dk/-/media/country-sites/techamb-en/media/white-paper-engelsk-version-.ashx">White Paper</a> with a proposal for debate and nine principles for a more responsible and fair society with major tech companies.

The portal is a shared infrastructure funded by national, regional and local authorities. The Citizen Portal also contains an English <a href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="sub-site for international citizens" resource="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/">sub-site for international citizens</a>. The Citizen Portal provides general, location-specific (e.g. region or municipality) and personal information, data and eServices for citizens, including access to Digital Post (more information on Digital Post below). In addition, the Citizen Portal features a range of &#x2018;self-service&#x2019; solutions, allowing citizens to manage their communications with the public sector effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, a single sign-on solution allows citizens to receive and access information and services from several agencies, without having to log on several times.</p><p>The portal currently contains more than 2&#xa0;000 self-service solutions. In 2021, 70.7 million visits were reported in the portal (with a population of 5.8 million citizens). The Citizen Portal offers a user-friendly interface, personalisation of content and syndication of borger.dk content, as well as flexibility for authorities wishing to add location-specific content to the portal. The most recent user survey shows that 92% of the users are &#x2018;satisfied&#x2019; or &#x2018;very satisfied&#x2019; with the Citizen Portal and 91% of the users feel safe using it.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">My Overview</p><p>My Overview is the citizens&#x2019; personal page on the Citizen Portal. Here, citizens can log on using their MitID to access some of the personal information public authorities have registered, such as information on tax, debt, student grants, or housing as well as status on benefits and ongoing cases with public authorities, upcoming agreements, and deadlines. The development of My Overview is part of a joint public political vision for creating transparency, and a better and more coherent digital service in the public sector. The overview is personalised, and therefore no one but the citizens themselves have access to the data on the site. My Overview is a supplement to existing websites or self-service solutions offering a wider digital overview of a citizen&#x2019;s data and interactions with the public sector as well as links to the relevant public websites. New public authorities join My Overview every year and display relevant information and data to citizens.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Guides to Life Events</p><p>The Agency for Digital Government and the Danish Business Authority are developing Digital Guides to support coherent user journeys in relation to the eleven most common life events for <a href="https://digiplace.sharepoint.com/sites/WE-EUROPEANCOMMISSION-ABCIV-SC442/Shared Documents/D04.01 Digital Public Administration factsheets and infographics/Country factsheets 2021/Denmark/Factsheet/-	www.borger.dk/flytteguide" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="citizens" resource="https://digiplace.sharepoint.com/sites/WE-EUROPEANCOMMISSION-ABCIV-SC442/Shared Documents/D04.01 Digital Public Administration factsheets and infographics/Country factsheets 2021/Denmark/Factsheet/-	www.borger.dk/flytteguide">citizens</a> and the ten most common life events for <a href="https://virk.dk/assistent" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="businesses" resource="https://virk.dk/assistent">businesses</a>.

The portal also provides an overview of the buying and selling processes at work. The portal thus offers an insight into housing transaction processes designed to prepare the property owner to engage with professional advisers. Several tools and documents enable property owners to carry out parts of a housing transaction single-handedly. Furthermore, property owners get access to large national databases containing data about buildings and can get acquainted with/or updated on rules regarding business rentals, purchase and rental of summer houses and holiday homes as well as real estate services.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">&#x2018;Live&#x2019; Operational Status</p><p>On the site <a href="http://www.datatilsynet.dk/english/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="digitalis&#xe9;r.dk/services" resource="http://www.datatilsynet.dk/english/">Digitalis&#xe9;r.dk/services</a>, businesses and citizens are able to see the operational status &#x2018;live&#x2019; on common public sector digital services.

The portal is managed jointly by mainly the Agency for Digital Government and the Danish Business Authority in collaboration with various other authorities and NGOs.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Automated Business Reporting</p><p>Automated Business Reporting also provides clear benefits for the authorities both through potential efficiency savings and also through a more targeted auditing and financial monitoring. Increased automation and digitalisation in the companies allow for a more efficient monitoring by the authorities. Equally, when financial records are kept in digital accounting systems, any changes in the records are logged and disclosed to the authorities. Based on this information, authorities can target monitoring operations and minimise the amount of audits made on law-abiding companies. Consequently, authorities are able to combat economic crime and tax fraud more efficiently.  </p><p>Finally, Automated Business Reporting will have a clear positive effect on the economy at large, as the projected GDP-effects are estimated to be at least EUR 255 million.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Climate Compass</p><p>To give businesses a user-friendly, transparent, and uniform tool to calculate their carbon footprint and gain an overview of how their climate impact is spread across activities over time, the Danish Business Authority and the Danish Energy Agency have introduced the &#x2018;Climate Compass&#x2019; tool, which targets SMEs. </p><p>The Compass allows businesses to: (i) calculate direct carbon emissions of company activities (i.e. own transportation and oil and gas consumption); (ii) calculate the indirect carbon emissions from their energy providers, subcontractors and customers; and (iii) estimate the climate impact of various carbon-reducing initiatives in the company. Currently, further functionalities of the Climate Compass are being developed.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Subnational Portals</h3><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Broadband Speed</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Data Distributor</p><p>The <a href="https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2018/439" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="data distributor" resource="https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2018/439">Data Distributor</a> is the main channel for accessing basic data from several authorities. It replaces a series of public distribution solutions and ensures that authorities and companies are provided with easy and safe access to basic data in one collective system, rather than resorting to many different systems and interfaces. By now, the Data Distributor samples a unique variety of basic data, e.g<em>.</em> civil registration numbers, registered data on land, properties, parcels and buildings, registered data on companies, registered data on addresses, administrative divisions and place names, geographical base maps, geodata, etc. More data will be constantly made available on the Data Distributor.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Reference Architecture for Sharing Data and Documents</p><ul><li>Transmission on request: typically, system-to-system integrations using an API; and</li><li>Transmission by message: typically, the legally binding communication of data (possibly in the form of documents) from public authorities to citizens and businesses, but also a classical pattern in system-to-system integrations.</li></ul><p>The fundamental difference between these two scenarios is whether it is the actor transmitting data or the actor receiving data, who is responsible for the concrete data process flow.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">New Application Profiles</p><p>A Danish application profile of version 2.0 of the <a href="https://eng.em.dk/media/13081/305755-gb-version_4k.pdf" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="dcat application profile" resource="https://eng.em.dk/media/13081/305755-gb-version_4k.pdf">DCAT Application Profile</a> for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP) has been completed and approved for use in the context of the Danish public sector (DCAT-AP-DK). </p><p>Furthermore, to support higher reuse and quality of metadata about IT systems, two application profiles have been established: a Basic Application Profile describing the core properties of public sector IT systems and an Archive Application Profile extending the basic profile elements relevant to the submission of information about IT systems to the National Archives.</p><p>In addition, a method for describing Dataset Quality has been established. The method has been developed on the basis of international standards such as the W3C Data on the Web Best Practices, including the Data Quality Vocabulary, and ISO 25012 on Data Quality.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">NemID Digital Signature and the New Danish eID, MitID</p><p>More information can be found in Section 3.3.2 (eID and Trust Services).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eIDAS eID-Gateway Node</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">NOBID Project</p><p> </p><p>NOBID has been extended until the end of 2024 and has become a sub-project under the Cross-Border Digital Service Programme (CBDS) with the aim of creating a common Nordic-Baltic platform for the implementation of parts of the eIDAS Regulation and the Single Digital Gateway Regulation.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">NemLog-in: Sign-In Solution</p><p>NemLog-in is a vital part of the public infrastructure and is the primary joint identity broker/identity provider solution. It also serves as integration point for public IT service providers and self-service solutions.</p><p>NemLog-in consists of a number of components that make up the Danish national platform for login and user access management. Established in 2008, NemLog-in is today in its third generation with over 150 IT service providers. It offers 500 self-service solutions and records more than a 100 million logins a year. One of the primary components is a login/authentication service with Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality. Citizens, employees in companies and authorities can log on to public self-services solutions and portals. Other NemLog-in components include central user access management, a signing service (including signature validation and possibly long-term storage), a power of attorney functionality and a Security Token Service (STS) functionality. Lastly, NemLog-in provides an administration component, where IT service providers and IT vendors can maintain their self-service solution integrations to NemLog-in.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Driving License App (<em>K&#xf8;rekort-appen</em>) and Digital Health Card</p><p>Since 24 November 2020, Danish citizens have been able to download their driving license in a <a href="https://digst.dk/it-loesninger/koerekort-app/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="new app" resource="https://digst.dk/it-loesninger/koerekort-app/">new app</a> (information not available in English) and leave their physical driving license at home. With more than 500&#xa0;000 downloads of the new app in the 24 hours after its release, almost 750&#xa0;000 in the first week, and now almost 2 million citizens have quickly adopted the new digital driving license.</p><p>Citizens who wish to subscribe to the app must possess a Danish driving licence, a NemID or MitID and a Danish passport. Users simply log in with their eID and scan their passport in order to download the passport photo to their driving license app. </p><p>The app has a built-in QR-code that enables the Danish police to use their dedicated app to confirm the digital driving license validity without touching the driver&apos;s phone. The app also displays a secondary QR-code with less information, which can be used as proof of identity, for instance to buy age-restricted products or pick up a parcel at the post office. The digital driving license app is only valid within the Danish borders.</p><p>Neither the digital driving license app nor the Digital Health Card replace the physical ID-cards. Physical driving licenses will still be assigned upon passing the driving test, and the health insurance card will also be issued physically. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Corona Passport</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Procurement Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.udbudsportalen.dk/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="procurement portal" resource="http://www.udbudsportalen.dk/">Procurement Portal</a> offers public and private providers guidance on the knowledge and tools necessary for the provision of tendering services.

In 2017, <em>Nemhandel</em> began to be integrated into Peppol, and in the years 2019 and 2020, it became mandatory for all public authorities to be affiliated to the Peppol network, via the <em>Nemhandel</em> Registry, which is also a Peppol registry. From January 2023, Peppol-based eCatalogues and eOrders will also be mandatory for public entities for certain categories of goods and services.</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">NemKonto</p><p>Most Danish citizens and companies occasionally receive payments from the public sector. These payments can be tax or VAT refunds, child subsidies, pensions, student loans, unemployment benefits, housing support or social welfare payments etc. All payments from public institutions are transferred directly to what is called a NemKonto account. </p><p>All citizens and companies registered in Demark are required to have a NemKonto. A NemKonto is a normal bank account that you assign as your NemKonto. Some private enterprises such as insurance and pension companies, are also able to make payments to a NemKonto as well. </p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Multi-Platform Knowledge Management</p><p>Knowledge management related to the Danish digital public administration infrastructure is distributed across a number of platforms and websites and managed by various government bodies. </p><p>The Agency for Digital Government is responsible for website hosting methodology, reference architectures, and specifications related to cross cutting digital government. The target group includes ministries, regions and municipalities, and the focus is on general digital government capabilities and interoperability. The agency is also responsible for a catalogue of core concepts and data models used across government as well as a central portal harvesting metadata from decentralised data catalogues. A new and thoroughly revised metadata portal is expected to be launched during 2022, which aims to be fully compatible with the European data portal (see also Section 3.3.4 above).
