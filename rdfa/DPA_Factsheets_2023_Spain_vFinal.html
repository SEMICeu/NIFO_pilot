The strategy involves different measures, reforms and investments, articulated around ten strategic areas (aligned with the European Commission&#x2019;s strategy). The overall goal of the strategy is to ensure that the benefits of the digital and ecological transition reach the whole society. </p><p>Digital Spain 2026 is the update of the strategy launched in July 2020. This agenda consists of nearly 50 measures articulated around ten strategic axes and classified into three dimensions: infrastructure and technology, economy and people.</p><p>It adds two new transversal axes referring to the Strategic Projects for Economic Recovery and Transformation (PERTE) and the RETECH initiative. The former consists of promoting large projects with the capacity to drive economic growth, employment and the competitiveness of the Spanish economy. The latter, called RETECH, includes a series of transformative strategic projects in the digital area proposed by the autonomous communities. It will receive additional financing from the general State administration and territorial administrations.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Administrations Digitisation Plan 2021&#x2013;2025</p><p>On 28 January 2021, the Spanish government presented the <a href="https://administracionelectronica.gob.es/pae_Home/pae_Actualidad/pae_Noticias/Anio2021/Enero/Noticia-2021-01-28-El-gobierno-invertira-en-planes-despliegue-de-la-Agenda-Espana-Digital-2025.html">Public Administration Digitisation Plan</a>, which is part of the higher-level strategy <a href="https://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/presidente/actividades/Documents/2020/230720-EspaÃÂ±aDigital_2025.pdf">Digital Spain 2025</a> and the 11<sup>th</sup> component of Spain&#x2019;s <a href="https://administracionelectronica.gob.es/pae_Home/dam/jcr:ad220c8a-d943-47f8-8474-df14783577d5/130421-Plan-de-recuperacion-Transformacion-y-Resiliencia.pdf">Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan</a>. The plan will be supported with a public investment of EUR 2.6 billion, in order to achieve its main goal: a simple, agile and efficient public administration. This goal will be pursued through the improvement of public administration accessibility by citizens and businesses, paired with strong data protection guarantees. In addition, the plan aims to overcome the digital gap between the different territories.</p><p>In addition to general actions covering all ministries, the digitisation programme will address specific sectors including health, justice, employment policy, diplomatic services and social integration. Among the different measures, for instance, the plan foresees the reinforcement of data interoperability in the health sector.</p><p>The plan will be structured around three lines of action:</p><ul><li>Digitally transforming the administration with horizontal initiatives for the deployment of efficient, safe and easy-to-use public services and for a generalised access to emerging technologies;</li><li>Deploying leading digitisation projects, e.g. in the areas of health, justice or employment; and</li><li>Supporting the digitisation of territorial administrations, Autonomous Communities and local entities.</li></ul><p>Some of the plan&#x2019;s key measures are:</p><ul><li>App Factory: this initiative will enhance mobile application development in the public sector;</li><li>One-click Administration: this initiative will facilitate and improve access to citizens and businesses to public information and digital services; and</li><li>GobTechLab: this programme will create an innovation lab within the government public administration in order to promote co-creation and innovation in public services.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Spain government signed the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government, thus re-affirming its commitment &#x2013; together with other EU Member States &#x2013; to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p>The General Foreign Service Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation, will promote a set of applications, infrastructures and content that will fully transform the consular service. The initiative is framed within the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan of the government of Spain and its primary objective is to facilitate electronic access to the Ministry&apos;s services by Spanish residents and non-residents abroad.

Additionally, it has been expanded to all administrative levels and can be used by any interested public administration body. </p><p>Furthermore, Cl@ve allows for people&#x2019;s identification with their National Identity Document (DNI and other eCertificates) and offers the possibility of signing in the cloud with personal certificates held on remote servers. Cl@ve is also integrated into eIDAS, the electronic identities cross-border recognition system, thus providing other EU countries&#x2019; identification mechanisms. Cl@ve and certificates in general will evolve in order to ensure cross-border use and improve both interoperability and reuse at all administrative levels.</p><p>Moreover, one of the measures included in this plan for the digitisation of the public sector is a new model of eID, providing citizens and businesses with an easier access to digital identification means.

Under this project, Spain is developing a model to create credentials with official diploma data with EBSI specifications and do a sovereign identity pilot. Spain is part of the early adopter group and, in the European framework, it has launched a pilot project that, by the end of 2021, will create credentials linked to Universities&#x2019; degrees following the EBSI specifications.</p><p>The third measure of the Public Sector Digitisation Plan 2020&#x2013;2025 sets out as an objective the creation of personalised and innovative public services that can be framed within European actions, participating with the Member States of the European Union in projects such as the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI, a blockchain network that will make it possible to provide public services throughout the European Union in a secure way), or proposals related to data and AI. As part of the GobTechLab foreseen in measure No. 3, a blockchain sandbox will be made available to administrations to work on testing this technology. </p><p>Spain is part of the Early Adopter Program to Promote the EBSI. In October 2021, it presented a use case for a verifiable identity credential prior to identification with a digital certificate and the use case for a verifiable credential for a diploma from the Rovira i Virgilli University. The development of a new identity model based on verifiable identity credentials and an ID wallet is currently being planned, as a new simpler and more intuitive system for citizens. This solution has many advantages:</p><ul><li>Storing and exchanging the information provided by trusted public or private sources; and</li><li>Citizens control their data.</li></ul><p>Moreover, on 13 November the Spanish government has approved Law No. 7/2020 for the digital transformation of the financial sector. This law foresees the creation of a regulatory and supervisory sandbox. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation has received <a href="https://portal.mineco.gob.es/es-es/comunicacion/Paginas/210224_np_-Sandbox.aspx">a total of 67 applications in the first call</a> for access to the sandbox provided for in Law No. 7/2020 for the digital transformation of the financial system. Currently two solutions have completed all tests, one of them regarding sovereign identity in the private sector.</p><p>As to regional administration, the government of Aragon, a pioneer in the implementation of blockchain bidding, has demonstrated the effectiveness of this use case.</p><p>Spain leads the DC4EU consortium for digital identity. This consortium seeks to promote the deployment and development of use cases in the new digital identity framework, testing its interoperability between cross-border systems, leveraging the blockchain technology and the experience of the EBSI project.
