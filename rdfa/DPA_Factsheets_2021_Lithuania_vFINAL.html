The law intends to simplify procedures and formalities that service providers need to comply with. In particular, it requires that unjustified and disproportionate burdens be removed in order to foster the establishment of businesses and the cross-border provision of services. The law also strengthens the rights of the recipients of such services and prohibits discriminatory conditions based on the nationality or the place of residence of the service recipient, (e.g. discriminatory tariffs).</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on Information Society Services</p><p>The <a href="https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.8A719A97956F/asr" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Law on Information Society Services</a><span resource="https://www.e-tar.lt/portal/lt/legalAct/TAR.8A719A97956F/asr" property="eli:title" content="Law on Information Society Services"/> was adopted in May 2006 to ensure the implementation of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">EU Directive 2000/31/EC</a><span resource="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML" property="eli:title" content="EU Directive 2000/31/EC"/> on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular on electronic commerce in the Internal Market (eCommerce Directive). The main purpose was to establish legal grounds to regulate the provision of information society services. The law defines the requirements for the information provided and the conclusion of agreements by electronic means, regulates responsibilities, rights/duties and activities of service providers and, furthermore, establishes the means for dispute resolution. </p><p>The law also protects the freedom to provide information society services towards a party established outside the country.
