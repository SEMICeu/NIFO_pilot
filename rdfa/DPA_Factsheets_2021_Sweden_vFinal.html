This strategy described how the Swedish government planned to further strengthen the ability of government agencies to work together in delivering digital services. More common digital services in the daily lives of both citizens and businesses have been further simplified. These digital services shall be developed in a user-centric way: simple, secure to use and easily accessible to everyone. Innovation has been enhanced by making it easier to find and use reusable public information and digital services with interfaces that can be operated by other systems. The publication of public sector information on the internet and the use of social media have promoted both transparency and citizen involvement. Quality and efficiency in government administration have been increased through standardised information management, better information security and digitised processes. Such internal efficiency in developing digital services must always be conditional on the protection of personal privacy and the need for confidentiality. The above-mentioned objectives have formed the basis of the Swedish government&#x2019;s coordinated and overriding development of inter&#x2011;agency cross-sectorial projects. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Development for the Digital Age - A New Strategy for Local and Regional Governments</p><p>In 2019, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) adopted a <a href="https://skr.se/naringslivarbetedigitalisering/digitalisering/strategifordigitalutveckling.6728.html">new strategy</a> for digital government, aiming to align efforts related to digital development in SALAR, the Swedish municipalities and regions, as well as in the SALAR groups <a href="https://www.sklkommentus.se/">SKL Kommentus</a> and <a href="https://www.inera.se/">Inera</a>. The strategy is aligned with the Swedish framework for digital collaboration and the European Interoperability Framework (EIF).</p><p>In order for the vision to be realised, both public and private efforts are required. The government will therefore work to maintain the positive development in fast broadband expansion.

In this report the Agency discusses possibilities and challenges, national and international investments in AI, legal and ethical aspects, and competence needs, specifically in the healthcare sector.</p><p> </p><p>Furthermore, Vinnova has declared that over the next ten years an additional 50 million SEK per year will be added to the annual 150 million SEK for financing AI-projects.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Standardisation Strategy</p><p>The <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/land--och-regionsstrategier/2018/07/regeringens-strategi-for-standardisering/">National Standardisation Strategy</a> <em>(Regeringens strategi f&#xf6;r standardisering)</em> was adopted in July 2018. The strategy identifies a number of Swedish strategic priorities from a national, European and international perspective, and describes how they should be addressed through an active Swedish standardisation policy.</p><p>In addition, sector-specific priorities are described. These priorities have been identified through a mapping activity and standardisation analysis of the government and other relevant authorities. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Interoperable Data Exchange</p><p>During the last years, the Swedish government has focused more on interoperability and standardisation, as demonstrated by the different government initiatives for standardised and interoperable information and data exchange. </p><p>More specifically, two government initiatives were launched in May 2018, focusing on establishing the foundation for a more standardised and interoperable national approach to base registries and information exchange. Several key stakeholders were involved in the initiatives, including some of the larger government agencies and the <a href="https://www.digg.se/en">DIGG</a>, which had the responsibility to coordinate work. </p><p>The final reports for the initiatives were submitted in 2019. In line with the proposals in the reports, two new government initiatives were started at the end of 2019 with a view to establishing a <a href="https://www.digg.se/om-oss/regeringsuppdrag/pagaende-regeringsuppdrag/nationellt-ramverk-for-grunddata/">national framework for basic data</a> in public administration and a <a href="https://www.digg.se/om-oss/regeringsuppdrag/pagaende-regeringsuppdrag/gemensam-informationsutbyte">digital infrastructure for information exchange</a>.

As a follow-up, the <a href="https://www.nordicinnovation.org/mobility" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Nordic Mobility Action Programme 2019&#x2013;2021</a><span resource="https://www.nordicinnovation.org/mobility" property="dct:title" content="Nordic Mobility Action Programme 2019&#x2013;2021"/> was adopted at a meeting of the Ministers for Nordic Cooperation in Reykjavik on 7 February 2019, the first meeting under the Icelandic Presidency of the Nordic Council of Ministers. The mobility programme, which has been extended to 2024, provides for higher funding for a range of projects and programmes that support mobility for individuals, and a list of measures that promote freedom of movement and Nordic integration for companies and individuals. </p><p>Cross-border electronic identification (eID) is one of the key enablers in this programme. The Nordic-Baltic eID Project (NOBID), which run from 2018 to 2020, had the aim of speeding up the implementation of the regulation on electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS regulation) in the Nordics and Baltics. In addition, the Nordic-Baltic cooperation on eID was on the agenda at the Nordic Prime Ministers&#x2019; meeting on 31 October 2018. The Prime Ministers supported the eID cooperation, securing access to trusted digital services across borders. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eID for Employees</p><p>The possibility to use employee eIdentifications in external services outside of the employee&#x2019;s organisation was identified as a great public and private interest in the eIdentification survey of 2019 and thus became a further goal of the Swedish government. A <a href="https://www.digg.se/4afaad/globalassets/dokument/publicerat/publikationer/eid-for-medarbetare.pdf">feasibility study</a> on this topic was published in 2020. Providers of eID and public relaying parties reached an agreement that eIDs for employees shall fulfil the same requirements as eIDs for citizens, including an approval from the DIGG, but also comprise a model where the employer acts as an identity provider in order to switch the identity attributes from the underlying eID to a pseudonym and combine it with an identifier for the organisation.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>At the beginning of March 2019, seven government agencies with responsibilities in the field of cybersecurity also presented a <a href="https://rib.msb.se/filer/pdf/28898.pdf" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Comprehensive Cybersecurity Action Plan 2019&#x2011;2020</a><span resource="https://rib.msb.se/filer/pdf/28898.pdf" property="dct:title" content="Comprehensive Cybersecurity Action Plan 2019&#x2011;2020"/> to implement the strategy at the agency level. The action plan contains 77 of the most important measures that were scheduled to begin implementation in 2019. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), together with the same seven government agencies, will release updated versions of the action plan annually up to 2022. The updated versions contain new measures to be initiated as well as an evaluation of the measures introduced starting 2019.

Several key stakeholders were involved, including some of the larger government agencies and the DIGG, which had the responsibility to coordinate work. </p><p>The final reports for these initiatives were submitted in 2019. As envisioned in the reports, two new government initiatives were launched at the end of 2019 with the aim of establishing a basic data national framework in public administration and a common digital management infrastructure for information exchange, for which an <a href="https://www.digg.se/4905d9/globalassets/dokument/publicerat/publikationer/delredovisning_etablera_nationellt_ramverk_for_grunddata_20210129.pdf">interim report</a> was published in 2021. The two initiatives will be implemented in 2021.</p><p>Furthermore, a number of Swedish authorities, mainly the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the Tax Agency and the Stockholm University, participated in the European large-scale pilot projects Once-Only Principle (OOP) and Digital Europe For All (DE4A), both exploring the OOP prior to the introduction of the Single Digital Gateway Regulation.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p>Guidance from Central Government Authorities</p><p>The National Agency for Public Procurement provides guidance on eProcurement, eCommerce, the usage of dynamic purchasing systems and sustainability analysis. The adopted method allows government agencies to focus their sustainability efforts on high impact categories.</p><p>The DIGG provides guidance on eProcurement and the use of Peppol infrastructure and standards for post-award messages. The DIGG is the Swedish Peppol authority, leading the work on the national Peppol infrastructure and offering support primarily to service providers within Peppol but also to end-users, like suppliers from the private sector and buyers in the public sector.</p><h2>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Vision for eHealth 2025</p><p>Digitisation offers great opportunities for the future of social services, health and medical care. Modern information and communication technologies (ICT) can make it easier for individuals to be involved in their own health and social care, support contact between individuals and service providers, and provide more efficient support systems for staff at service providers.</p><p>In February 2020, a<a href="https://ehalsa2025.se/visionen/"> strategy for eHealth for the period of 2020&#x2013;2022</a> complemented the vision. The purpose of the strategy is to determine how the joint work of the government and SALAR should be designed and prioritised. The priorities identified are: (i) people awareness and involvement; (ii) safe and secure information; (iii) knowledge; (iv) digital transformation; and (v) collaboration. The government and SALAR will also work together on the legal framework and the consistent use of terminology and standards.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digitisation of the Judiciary</p><p>Digitisation can contribute to a judicial system which is well-functioning, efficient, based on rule of law and trusted by the people. Authorities in the judicial system should accelerate the digital exchange of information and at the same time strengthen their digital government capability, based on the <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/forordning--20191283-om-rattsvasendets_sfs-2019-1283">Ordinance (2019:1283) on the Digitisation of the Judiciary</a>. In light of this, judicial authorities have been commissioned to jointly develop methods for managing criminal cases, focusing on efficiency, and to examine how to offer crime victims a better digital response.</p><p>In order to strengthen coordination, the government established a Council for the Digitisation of the Judiciary, consisting of representatives from the law enforcement agencies. The Council held its first meeting in September 2020.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Covid-19 and the Effects on Digitisation &#x2013; A National Study</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Covid-19 and the Effects on the Development of eHealth</p><p>The pandemic can be expected to have an impact also in the future: standards have obviously changed, as a large proportion of the population has become more accustomed to using digital tools in their everyday work. This is likely to facilitate the increased use of digital tools in the future, also in healthcare. At the same time, the digital divide remains and perhaps the gap between those who have the necessary abilities and access to new technology and those who lack them can widen. </p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">European Blockchain Partnership</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Use of New Technologies in Public Sector </p><p>The <a href="https://www.lantmateriet.se/en/">Swedish Mapping, Cadastral and Land Registration Authority</a> (<em>Lantm&#xe4;teriet</em>) and the <a href="https://www.digg.se/en">DIGG</a> jointly carried out a <a href="https://www.digg.se/om-oss/regeringsuppdrag/avslutade-regeringsuppdrag/ny-teknik-vid-automatisering-inom-offentlig-forvaltning">government assignment</a> to test new technology for automation in public administration.

The National Medication List creates a single source for data on a patient&#x2019;s prescribed medicines and other products while safeguarding the patient&#x2019;s right to privacy. The data may, for example, be used by pharmacies and healthcare providers, under certain circumstances.</p><p>As mentioned, the legislation on the National Medication List gained legal force on 1 May 2021 with a transition period of two years. During the transition period, healthcare providers must adapt their systems to the new legislation. Existing information technology (IT) services and systems will be phased out after the transition period but will continue being in production, in parallel with the new IT services that have been developed for the new list.</p><p>Registering data in the National Medication List will be mandatory for pharmacies and prescribers of medicines. Patients can block access to certain information but not opt&#x2011;out from the registration.
