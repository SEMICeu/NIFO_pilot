The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Hungary in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Hungary&#x2019;s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, with all principles falling within the EU average for which it scored 3. It is worth mentioning the performance of Principle 10 (Administrative simplification) implementation, which increased from a score of 3 to 4 in 2022. The areas for improvement are concentrated in Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 7 (Inclusion and accessibility), 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the alignment and tailoring of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies with the EIF (Principle 1 &#x2013; Recommendation 1), the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 &#x2013; Recommendation 14), the availability of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism (Principle 9 &#x2013; Recommendation 16) and the implementation of evaluation mechanisms to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of interoperable solutions (Principle 12 &#x2013; Recommendation 19) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Hungarian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall high performance with a score of 4, with the exception of the area of interoperability governance, for which Hungary scored 3. This score could be particularly improved with the existence of defined processes for the selection and adoption of standards and specifications (Recommendation 21), the use of a structured, transparent, objective and common approach for the assessment and selection of standards and specifications (Recommendation 22) and the consultation of relevant catalogues for standards, specifications and guidelines at the national and EU level (Recommendation 23) by Hungary.</p><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Hungary&#x2019;s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model, internal information sources and services, base registries and open data. It is worth mentioning that the implementation of the recommendations relating to security and privacy has led to the score moving from 3 to 4 in 2022. However, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to the catalogues, external information sources services. In particular, putting in place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions (Catalogues - Recommendation 44) as well as the lack of use of external information sources and services while developing European public services (External information and services &#x2013; Recommendation 45).</p><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Hungary concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at upper-middle performance of the country in 16 indicators. Particularly, Hungary has a high performance with the maximum score of four in Principle 8 and 11 (i.e. Security and privacy, Preservation of information) as well as Legal interoperability and Open Data (i.e. Recommendation 27, 41 and 43). However, Hungary has still margin for improvement. For instance, efforts could focus on the reuse and share solutions, and cooperate in the development of joint solutions when implementing European public services (i.e. Recommendation 6) and on simplifying processes and use digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users&#x2019; requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens.

The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Digitalisation Strategy 2022&#x2013;2030</p><p>The government adopted the <a href="https://cdn.kormany.hu/uploads/document/6/60/602/60242669c9f12756a2b104f8295b866a8bb8f684.pdf">National Digitalisation Strategy 2022&#x2013;2030</a> in November 2022. The strategy builds on the results of the previous National Infocommunication Strategy 2014&#x2011;2020 and the Digital Success Programme 2.0.</p><p>Aiming to develop the economy, education, innovation and research, and public administration, the strategy is based on four pillars and the following focus areas:</p><ul><li>Digital infrastructure: promote the development of gigabit-capable networks and 5G, expand the digital infrastructures for schools and higher education institutions, ensure the continued development of the National Telecommunication Backbone Network, and increase the supercomputing capacity for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), research networks and public institutions;</li><li>Digital skills: create programmes for digital competency, increase the number and capacity of information technology (IT) professionals and support the learning of digital skills in education;</li><li>Digital economy: increase the digital reach and use of SMEs, develop digital start-up businesses, create support programmes for the information and communication technology (ICT) industry and its development, and utilise data assets of the government for economic purposes; and</li><li>Digital State: support the digital development of both central and local, and cross-border public administration with user-friendly systems and customer-centric services, develop smart towns and smart areas, and increase electronic services.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Digital Citizen Programme 2022&#x2013;2026</p><p>The government adopted the <a href="https://dmu.gov.hu/documents/prod/DMU_nemzeti_digitalis_allampolgarsag_program_2022.pdf">National Digital Citizen Programme 2022&#x2013;2026</a> in December 2022 as a sectoral strategic programme introducing the &#x2018;digital citizen&#x2019; concept. This concept aims to reinterpret the relationship between the State and the citizen based on the digital identity initiative launched by the EU, through basic services (eID, ePost, eDocuments and ePayment) and user-friendly channels operating on a single platform, with a &#x2018;mobile first&#x2019; approach.</p><p>One of the most important basic services is Mia Chatbot easy-to-use digital identification service, which can support many complex administration processes. In this context, a new mobile application will be developed and implemented for electronic identification (eID), in accordance with the legal provisions of the successor regulation of the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation), which will establish the framework for a European digital identity. With the help of the new mobile wallet to be developed, citizens can log in to the digital citizen platform and use the main digital public services according to the life events covered.</p><p>In accordance with EU requirements, the application will be able to receive and store user data, with an appropriate level of encryption. Its functions include mutual authentication for external (public or private) parties, the sharing of designated data and the creation of authentic eSignatures. The application will provide the above-mentioned functions on a simple, user-friendly interface and will be compatible with the systems of other (including foreign) stakeholders. According to the schedule of the National Digital Citizenship Programme, by 2026 citizens will be able to use all necessary digital public services online, on their mobile devices.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Digitalisation Strategy 2022&#x2013;2030</p><p>The <a href="https://cdn.kormany.hu/uploads/document/6/60/602/60242669c9f12756a2b104f8295b866a8bb8f684.pdf">National Digitalisation Strategy 2022&#x2013;2030</a> presents increased interoperability as one of the requirements for the fourth pillar on the development of a digital State. More specifically, it identifies the need to establish a data-based administration in the country, with interoperable data connections between administrative services on different levels (local, national and European) and aspects (legal, organisational, semantic and technical).</p><p>In addition to technology neutrality and IT security requirements, a development based on software with open-source codes needs to be encouraged. The necessary legislative framework to that end was established according to the National Infocommunication Strategy 2014&#x2013;2020 with the adoption of <a href="http://njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=193173" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">Act No. CCXXII of 2015 on the General Rules for Electronic Administration and Trust Services</a><span resource="http://njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=193173" property="dct:title" content="Act No. CCXXII of 2015 on the General Rules for Electronic Administration and Trust Services"/> (hereinafter, the eAdministration Act). Pursuant to the eAdministration Act, from 1&#xa0;January 2018 the cooperating bodies involved in administrative processes shall obtain information (data or documents) from another cooperating body rather than asking the customer (citizen or business) to resubmit it. Information must be obtained by automated data exchange processes, where possible, or otherwise by a simple secure information exchange. Furthermore, according to the eAdministration Act electronically cooperating organisations are obliged to prepare and publish information transfer rules, as well as send them to the Electronic Administration Supervisory Authority (E&#xdc;F) within the Ministry of the Interior.</p><h2>Key Enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Public Sector Information Reuse</p><p>In 2012, the public sector information (PSI) Directive was fully implemented in line with all EU requirements in the form of the Public Data Act (Act No. LXIII of 2012). The 2013 amendment of the PSI Directive was then implemented by the deadline of 2015 (Act No. XCVI of 2015), with the Hungarian implementation going beyond the provisions of the PSI Directive in some aspects. The Public Data Act was subsequently modified in 2022 to implement the Open Data Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/1024), ensuring full harmonisation with EU law in this respect.</p><p>Furthermore, the new <a href="https://ai-hungary.com/api/v1/companies/15/files/137203/view">Strategy on Artificial Intelligence 2020&#x2013;2030</a> was adopted, including a dedicated part on data policy and data reuse which calls for a proper institutional background and a one&#x2011;way&#x2011;access data portal. Within the framework of the strategy, the national open data portal has been launched and the National Data Asset Management Agency (<em>Nemzeti Adatvagyon &#xdc;gyn&#xf6;ks&#xe9;g,</em> NAV&#xdc;) has been established with the main purpose of facilitating and coordinating the reuse of public sector data among public sector bodies. The Agency also provides analysis and information services to public sector bodies. That way, the proper institutional background outlined in the strategy has been successfully created. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Central Authentication Agent</p><p>The <a href="https://nisz.hu/hu/kaÃÂ¼-Ã¢ÂÂ-kÃÂ¶zponti-azonosÃÂ­tÃÂ¡si-ÃÂ¼gynÃÂ¶k">Central Authentication Agent</a> building block supports the use of different eID services, including the Client Gate trusted profile, Client Gate+ (the two-factor version of the Client Gate), the national eID card, partial code telephone authentication and video-based facial recognition authentication. All eServices integrated with the Central Authentication Agent can be accessed via all these eID methods. </p><p>eIDAS authentication will also be available within the Central Authentication Agent. The Hungarian eIDAS node&#x2019;s development has been finished and the bilateral tests conducted with Member States should be completed by the first half of 2023. Once this process is ended, it should be possible to publish eIDAS identification in the Central Authentication Agent service and to put the eIDAS identification option into operation in the Central Authentication Agent for the connected sector-specific systems. The latter may also need to examine their administrative processes and implement the necessary developments to be able to accept eIDAS identification.</p><p>In January 2023, the number of valid, chip-containing eID cards issued since the launch in January 2016 surpassed 6.6 million and the number of Client Gate accounts exceeded 5.5 million.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security Aspects</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>The <a href="https://nki.gov.hu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Strategy-for-the-security-of-network-and-information-systems-in-Hungary.pdf">Cybersecurity Strategy</a> of Hungary was adopted at the end of December 2018 (1838/2018 (XII 28)) by governmental resolution, aiming to establish a free, safe, innovative and competitive cyberspace, increase Hungary&#x2019;s competitiveness, introduce innovations and new technologies in a secure manner, and adapt them to the digitalised public administration, government and economy. The strategy has created a safer electronic public administration system and led to an innovative development of public services, as well as raised awareness in all areas of society.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Government Projects and Cybersecurity</p><p>The National Cyberdefence Centre of the Special Service for National Security must assess the conformity of each public administration IT and eGovernment service development project with the rules of Act No. L of 2013.

As a result, in Hungary the interconnection of base registries is not a matter of political communication, but a legal obligation.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Domain-specific Political Communications</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Digital Citizen Programme</p><p>The Hungarian government adopted the <a href="https://www.dmu.gov.hu/documents/prod/DMU_nemzeti_digitalis_allampolgarsag_program_2022.pdf">National Digital Citizen Programme</a>, aimed at creating the conditions for simple, convenient and efficient administration, as reported by the Digital Hungary Agency at the end of December 2022. The programme formulates the policy objectives and principles for the first half of the period covered by the National Digitalisation Strategy, i.e. 2022&#x2013;2026, by which the goals and measures formulated in the strategy shall be achieved.</p><p>In practice, the concept aims to create a truly user-friendly service environment entirely meeting customers&#x2019; needs, with services that are fully functional on mobile devices, and eID for domestic and cross-border use. </p><p>In other words, the programme aims to create public administrative spaces that can be accessed online at any time and are suitable for handling all administrative formalities that can be dealt with in person. A Digital Citizen Mobile App will be developed, where all important services will be available in a user-friendly way on smartphones. It will include digital citizenship, as well as the use of national data assets and the application of cloud technology. </p><p>The goal of the first strategic phase &#x2013; namely that citizens should be able to handle almost all public administration matters online &#x2013; is set to be reached in 2026. However, the development of the most important services will start in 2023.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">National Digital Agricultural Strategy</p><p>The <a href="https://digitalisjoletprogram.hu/files/24/2e/242e263bd2b441f6f30cf400e06e1e4a.pdf">National Digital Agricultural Strategy</a>, adopted in 2019, aims to support the increase in efficiency of the agricultural sector.

The aim of Hungary&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.mnb.hu/letoltes/mnb-fintech-strategy-eng-cov.pdf">Fintech Strategy</a>, as part of the Digital Success Programme, is to create a favourable regulatory and market environment for both traditional and new stakeholders of the financial market, enabling them to supply customers with innovative, easy-to-use and cost-effective solutions.</p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Artificial Intelligence Coalition</p><p>The <a href="https://ai-hungary.com/en/content/ai-coalition">Hungarian Artificial Intelligence Coalition</a> was founded on 9&#xa0;October 2018 with the following goals:</p><ul><li>Providing a continuous cooperation forum for artificial intelligence (AI) developers, market operators, State participants representing AI users, academics and professional organisations;</li><li>Developing a Hungarian AI Strategy; and</li><li>Analysing the social and economic impacts related to the spread of AI.</li></ul><p>The Coalition has developed an action plan that lays the groundwork for the Hungarian data market and the institutional framework of the local AI ecosystem. It also defines the legislative and infrastructural structure of data capital management by creating data markets and making personally non-identifiable public data searchable. In addition, widespread multi-stage awareness-raising campaigns have been launched by relying on a diverse range of communication tools. In May 2020, the Coalition presented the<a href="https://ai-hungary.com/files/e8/dd/e8dd79bd380a40c9890dd2fb01dd771b.pdf"> Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2020&#x2013;2030</a>, offering an overview of the current state of development of AI, but also setting the objectives and target indicators to be met. The strategy was officially approved and announced in September 2020.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed Ledger Technologies </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Blockchain Coalition</p><p>Hungary is a member of the European Blockchain Partnership, in the framework of which it has established its own European Blockchain Service Infrastructure node (in cooperation between the Digital Success Programme and the Governmental Agency for IT Development or KIF&#xdc;). The aim is to become more involved in European cooperation.</p><p>To build a broader industry consensus on the applicability of blockchain technology, in March 2022 Hungary established a Blockchain Coalition. This new cooperation platform is a permanently open forum for public, educational, civic and corporate stakeholders active in the Hungarian blockchain ecosystem and seeks to build international partnerships.</p><p>The Hungarian National Bank &#x2013; as a key supporter of blockchain technology &#x2013;developed in May 2022 a dedicated non-fungible token (NFT) platform based on a private blockchain, which could be considered a global first.</p><p>An amendment passed in December 2022 introduced financial assets issued using distributed ledger technology (DLT) into the definition of financial assets in the Law concerning investment companies and commodity exchange service providers, as well as the rules for the activities they can perform.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big Data</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud Computing</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Data Centre</p><p>According to the National Digital Citizen Programme adopted by the government in December 2022, the development of the cloud for public administration use is one of the main strategic goals of the Digital Hungary Agency for the upcoming years. It will contribute to better policy making and internal management within the public administration, by providing more secure, more economic and easily scalable services that can further improve the efficiency of the functioning of the public sector.</p><p>As part of this goal, the Digital Hungary Agency aims to establish a data centre in Hungary in collaboration with an international cloud service provider, where a dedicated server space would be created for the Hungarian digital public service systems. Such a cooperation between the public and the private sector would be mutually beneficial: as in the region at the moment only one leading cloud provider has a data centre (in Vienna), this could result in potential gains for international cloud providers, while keeping the costs lower for the State budget.</p><p>On a short term, a mixed cloud service model is planned, based on a close cooperation between a cloud service provider and the government&#x2019;s own cloud service offered on the basis of the already existing Government Data Centre. On a longer term, a multi-cloud model is envisioned, where more international cloud operators become part of this cooperation. </p><p>According to the classification of data, non-classified data can be stored in the public cloud in an encrypted form, while classified data remain in the local Government Data Centre. Therefore, the Government Data Centre also has to be further developed so that it can support systems that cannot be channelled into the international cloud service, with modern functions.</p><p>In line with the above-mentioned goals, new eGovernment applications and systems need to be developed in a way that is fully optimised for the cloud environment.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance Computing</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">High Performance Computing Infrastructure and Ecosystem</p><p>Government Decision 1422/2020 (VII 23) set the direction for the development of the Hungarian high performance computing (HPC) ecosystem. It also appointed KIF&#xdc; as the operator of the National HPC Competence Centre, and provided EUR 1.36 million for the infrastructure and EUR 0.66 million for the National HPC Competence Centre operation for 2022.</p><p>In the framework of the Economic Development and Innovation Operational Programme (GINOP), KIF&#xdc; procured and installed a new 5-PetaFlops HPC called &#x2018;Komondor&#x2019;, which was put into operation in December 2022 at the premises of the Debrecen University. The project, with an overall budget amounting to EUR 16.5 million, was finalised in the first quarter of 2023. The &#x2018;Komondor&#x2019; HPC is built with modern, energy-efficient technologies. As a result, despite the large computing power, the electricity need is just over 300 kW. In addition, the machine uses a hot water-cooling solution, enabling the recycling of the waste heat produced by the machine. </p><p>Currently, together with the Komondor, KIF&#xdc; operates three different HPCs with an overall capacity of 5.4 PetaFlops, offering specialized AI, big data, graphics programming unit (GPU) and central processing unit (CPU) partitions. The main clients of KIF&#xdc;&#x2019;s HPCs are educational and research institutes, as well as SMEs.</p><p>Hungary is among the founding States of the EuroHPC joint undertaking (JU). Together with the EuroHPC JU, KIF&#xdc; is working on a project aimed at building and hosting in Hungary the 20&#x2011;PetaFlops HPC called &#x2018;Levente&#x2019; by 2025 at the latest. In parallel, in cooperation with the German partners J&#xfc;lich Research Centre and ParTec AG, work has started towards extending &#x2018;Levente&#x2019; with a quantum module. The demanding and ambitious Hungarian plans towards research and implementation of a quantum computing module into the modular structure of the future &#x2018;Levente&#x2019; HPC has also resulted in an ambitious German-Hungarian 4-party framework agreement. In addition to quantum development, it is aimed at HPC software and parallel algorithm development work, as well as HPC application development for analysing and modelling challenging problems such as the energy crisis and climate change, increasing the quality of meteorological services, supporting the Industry 4.0 and 5.0, etc. </p><p>KIF&#xdc; also successfully took part in the action called &#x2018;National Competence Centres in the Framework of EuroHPC&#x2019;, which ended in December 2022. The overall budget of the action was EUR 2 million, with 50% of the funds provided by the EuroHPC call and 50% by the national budget. Based on the results of this action, KIF&#xdc; started the preparations for participating in EuroCC 2, which starts in the first quarter of 2023. </p><p>As part of the EuroHPC launched activities, the National HPC Competence Centre has joined the consortium of the European Competence Centres. The yearly budget of the National HPC Competence Centre amounts to EUR 1 million, of which 50% is covered by EuroHPC support and 50% by national financing.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed Broadband Connectivity </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Superfast Broadband Programme</p><p>The Hungarian government launched the Superfast Broadband Programme in 2015. The original aim was to reach 100% broadband connectivity footprint, with minimum 30Mbps download speed, by the end of 2018. The programme has then continued beyond 2018, aiming at meeting higher bandwidth needs and also including the development of fibre optic backhaul connectivity, especially in rural areas. The programme includes the direct deployment of the State aid network as well as the operators&apos; own developments coordinated by the Ministry.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">5G Coalition</p><p>The objective of the Hungarian government is to make Hungary a frontrunner in 5G development in terms of regulation and technological advances in the fields of automotive industry (autonomous and connected vehicles), industrial Internet of Things (IoT), health, transport and other areas.

The NTCA also provides an online invoicing solution free of charge, mainly for SMEs, that can be used to issue eInvoices as well as paper invoices, and automatically sends the invoice data to the NTCA, regardless of the amount of output VAT. To promote and encourage eInvoicing and digital administration, in May 2020 this free online invoicing programme was made available through a mobile app, also helping to reduce administrative burdens. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing in Public Procurement</p><p>To comply with Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement, since 18&#xa0;April 2019 the Public Procurement Act has been requiring contracting authorities to receive and process invoices complying with the relevant European standard.

All three AI-assisted services use deep learning to learn continuously in a supervised way. The new central AI-based building block services are offered from the Government Data Centre, thus ensuring the highest security requirements for closed electronic information systems, so that services used by the client will not be available to third parties.</p><p>For illustration, the AI-supported MIA Chatbot of the Government Hotline was introduced in May 2021 for responding to written inquiries using a combination of artificial and human intelligence. Based on the communication of customer service operators, the chatbot offers response options to operators and then, continuously learning from the accepted response suggestions, it can enter into fully automatic mode. The MIA Chatbot currently provides assistance to citizens in using the Client Gate service, the Company Gate eDelivery service for businesses. In 2022 the Government Hotline answered more than 600&#xa0;000 customer questions via the MIA Chatbot service, of which 38% automatically, 60% semi-automatically (with the operator choosing from the options suggested by the bot) and only 2% by manual answering. The use of the MIA Chatbot is planned to be further expanded in 2023 by adding further services, with new functions. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Blockchain Module </p><p>A blockchain module has been implemented to issue the first driver&#x2019;s licenses through an automated service.

The received exam data are handled in an irrevocable and irrefutable way by linking the received data packages to each other and authenticating them with a time stamp, depending on the person and the procedure. More in detail, the blockchain module:</p><ul><li>Processes the chronologically-chained certification data received, linking them to the person;</li><li>Based on the received data, makes an evaluation decision as to whether all the conditions for the driver&#x2019;s license are met, i.e. whether the document issuance procedure can be initiated;</li><li>is capable of providing a snapshot of the entire history of the data container at a given moment in time, as well as transmitting only valid data; and</li><li>after the successful issuance of the driver&#x2019;s license, closes the data containers and monitors the data retention period for data protection reasons.</li></ul><p>As another example, the Hungarian National Bank &#x2013; as a key supporter of blockchain technology &#x2013; developed in May 2022 a dedicated NFT platform based on a private blockchain.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big data </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud computing</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Government Data Centre</p><p>Avoiding using external (public and hybrid) cloud services in the public administration is a key element of the Hungarian government&#x2019;s IT policy.
