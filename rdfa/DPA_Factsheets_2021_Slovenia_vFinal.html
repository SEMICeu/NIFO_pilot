After the technological renovation at the end of 2018, the system combines functionalities that were originally developed as part of different stand-alone modules/applications </a>(eSubmissions, eAuctions, eDossier, eCatalogue and eInternal procedures for public authorities). </p><p>Furthermore, the 2017 amendment to the <a href="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Sistem_javnega_narocanja/ZPVPJN/ZPVPJN_ang_julij_18.pdf" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Legal Protection in Public Procurement Procedures Act</a><span resource="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Sistem_javnega_narocanja/ZPVPJN/ZPVPJN_ang_julij_18.pdf" property="eli:title" content="Legal Protection in Public Procurement Procedures Act"/> introduced an electronic information system for legal protection procedures in public procurement, i.e. the <a href="https://www.portalerevizija.si/">eRevision Portal</a>. The eRevision Portal was established in September 2019 and enables the exchange of information and documents between contracting authorities, selected tenderers, the National Review Commission and other participants in the appeal proceedings. The eRevision Portal enables a widespread flow of information about the course of the review procedure. It communicates with the Public Procurement Portal to allow a smooth flow of information and documentation. This will significantly reduce the duration of the procedure and the administrative burdens and costs for the parties involved. The use of this portal is mandatory from 1 January 2021. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing Legislation</p><p>In Slovenia, the competent authority with purview on eInvoicing is the <a href="https://www.ujp.gov.si/dokumenti/dokument.asp?id=295">Public Payments Administration of the Republic of Slovenia</a>, attached to the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>Since 1 January 2015, public sector institutions have begun receiving electronic invoices for any goods and services.

Ever since, considerable progress has been made in terms of development, availability and use of eHealth. The Healthcare Databases Act was amended in 2018 to support cancer screening programmes and clinical registries. In 2020, the act was further amended in order to respond to the challenges of the COVID-19 epidemics and the related data processing requirements. The amendment provided legal ground for comprehensive digitalisation of communicable disease surveillance. Moreover, it facilitated the processing of health records for all persons receiving medical treatment in Slovenia, irrespective of their nationality, by means of enabling cross-border exchange of healthcare records within the Central Registry of Patient Data (CRPD). </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act </p><p>The <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4284" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act</a><span resource="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4284" property="eli:title" content="Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act"/> and the accompanying Regulation on Documents and Archives Protection were both passed in 2006 to regulate the management of electronic content. The act states that all electronic records, including digitalised documents, have full legal status provided they comply with certain technical conditions. The accompanying regulation governs the activities and internal rules for individuals to keep documents and/or archives, the storage of such materials in physical and digital forms, the general conditions, the registration and accreditation of digital storage equipment and services, the selection and transfer of archives to public archival institutions, the processing and keeping of registers of archives, the protection of film and private archives, the use of archives in archival institutions and the work of the Archives Commission. The law also contains provisions regarding the long-term validity of eSignatures. Later amendments to the act took place in 2014. </p><p>This law eliminated the obligation of certifying internal rules for companies and public authorities at the Archives Commission and simplified the procedures for accreditation.

To be able to provide all the necessary knowledge and equipment, the DIHs need to collaborate with research &amp; technology organisations (RTO) and various different stakeholders. They normally combine the national, regional and local level and, to be able to do so effectively, they need to have a wide range of partners. The DIHs are currently filling the existing gaps on the market, and some of the existing DIH will become EDIH and thus offer an even wider variety of services, according to EC rules. For the time being, the DIHs benefit from a great support from the European Commission, which aims to gather all European DIHs under one umbrella, the EDIH network. However, each Member State is free to organise national DIHs in the way it deems best.

In this framework, human resources often prove to be as challenging as financial ones. Generally, urban municipalities, i.e. the 11 main regional centres, achieved significant improvement in the digitalisation of services by developing various portals and digital solutions, including the digitalisation of public services data.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Smart Mlaka - a Smart Pilot Project</p><p>A prominent digitalisation and smart city project is being implemented in the city of Kranj.

It was completely redesigned using a new system architecture and a new user interface. It was based on a CMS system, which enables effortless content maintenance.</p><p>In 2021, more than 30 back-offices, registers and other databases have connected to the portal. Services are provided according to life events. </p><p>The main elements of the renewed portal are the electronic services, which are seamlessly integrated into the content and easily accessible. Users may access various services (currently about 250) through the integration of public bodies&#x2019; information systems. Every authenticated user can use their digital certificate to access personal storage, which allows them to store their private documents. The users can also view their personal data from various public records (e.g. personal information, information about their vehicle and real estate property).</p><p>eUprava is the first portal that enables its users to authenticate and eSign the applications with mobile phones. This functionality is based on the integration of SI&#x2011;PASS (the authentication and eSignature service) that, since April 2018, also offers an authentication and eSignature mobile service called smsPASS (see below for more info on SI-PASS and smsPASS). </p><p>Since November 2020, the portal has been integrated with the new central solution for eDelivery SI-CeV. The users can activate their secure mailbox within their My e-Government personal space to receive official documents according to the administrative procedure legislation from more than 100 public institutions. In 2021, the possibility has been introduced to authenticate on the portal using foreign certificates via eIDAS mechanisms.</p><p>In 2020&#x2013;2021, new electronic services for municipalities were published on the portal, both on the Portal for Citizens eUprava and on the Business Portal <a href="https://spot.gov.si/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="spot" resource="https://spot.gov.si/">SPOT</a>.</p><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, some successful new electronic applications were offered, also without eAuthentication, to increase the number of possible users (e.g. financial aid for students, residence registrations).

Through the SPOT Portal, businesses can use electronic services to establish a company and carry out other obligatory or frequent procedures, either at start-up or later (submission of forms for social insurance registration, declaration of changes to information on family members, notification of needs for workers, declaration of tax information, etc.). Users can carry out certain procedures independently online, using a valid digital certificate, while for some other more complicated procedures they would need to visit one of the 139 One Stop Shop contact points, the VEM point or a public notary. </p><p>The main advantages of the SPOT Portal are the following: it enables a free-of-charge sole trader registration within one day (in the past it took seven days), the registration of a company with limited liabilities within three days (in the past it took more than 60 days). It also enables several eServices. </p><p>The majority of services carried out via the SPOT Portal or the SPOT points are free of charge. New services are constantly developed for SPOT. In terms of development of new services, relevant stakeholders are being involved and the principles of interoperability are followed. The development is carried out with the cooperation of different governmental bodies. It includes the connection of different IT systems into the eService of SPOT, aiming at reusing already available data from different registries or systems and following the Once-Only principle, where possible.</p><p>In 2020, an important new functionality - the &#x2018;electronic sick leave&#x2019; - was introduced on the portal, which significantly reduced the administrative burden.
