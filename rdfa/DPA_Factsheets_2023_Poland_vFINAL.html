The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation.

Poland&#x2019;s performance on Principle 1 increased since 2021, scoring above the EU average for this Principle. Possible areas of improvements are particularly concentrated in Principle 9 (Multilingualism) for which the score of 3 shows a medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the country could invest more efforts in information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 &#x2013; Recommendation 16), so as to reach a higher score in this Principle. </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Polish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall a strong performance with scores of 3 on interoperability governance and a score of 4 on the other layers. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country&#x2019;s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance. More specifically, the score of 1 for Poland in Recommendation 23 could be improved by further consulting relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level when procuring and developing IT solutions.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Poland&#x2019;s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance, globally aligned with the European average, in the implementation of recommendations associated with all indicators of the conceptual model, expect for catalogues (no data). Poland&#x2019;s scores increased for two principles since 2021: internal information sources and services (from one to four) and Security and Privacy (from three to four). However, there is room for improvement with regard to recommendations associated with external information sources and services. More specifically, the lack of use of external information sources and services while developing European public services (Recommendation 45) hinders the overall Polish score with regard to external information sources and services.</p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Poland&#x2019;s results on Cross-Border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show a medium performance of the country, as well as missing data for multiple indicators. Based on the available data, Poland reaches the maximum score of four for three principles, for legal and technical interoperability, as well as open data and security and privacy. However, Poland has still margin for improvement in relation to two main indicators where the country obtains a lower performance: Principle 10 (Administrative simplification &#x2013; Cross-border) and Internal information sources and services, which both scores below the EU average. To improve its performance on Principles 10, Poland&#x2019;s efforts could focus on simplifying processes and using digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users&#x2019; requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens (Recommendation 17).</p><p>Additional information on Poland&#x2019;s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring" property="dct:relation">interactive dashboards</a><span resource="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring" property="eli:title" content="interactive dashboards"/>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="../html/img/32-439.png" alt="32-439.png" class="keepElement"/></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p></div><div resource="http://example.org/ContactPoint/Poland" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2>Specific political communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government </p><p>In December 2020, the Polish government signed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment &#x2013; together with other European Union (EU) Member States &#x2013; to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategy for Responsible Development </p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/documents/33377/436740/SOR_2017_streszczenie_en.pdf">Strategy for Responsible Development</a> for the period up to 2020 (including the perspective up to 2030) sets basic conditions, objectives and directions for the country development in social, economic, environmental and territorial terms for 2020 and 2030. The main objective of the strategy is to create the conditions for an increase in the income of Polish citizens while improving social, economic, environmental and territorial cohesion. The key indicators of the strategy include the growth of Polish gross domestic product (GDP) per capita up to 95% of the EU28 average by 2030, and a drop in the risk of poverty and social exclusion indicator to 17 by 2030.</p><p>Ensuring a high and stable growth rate will be facilitated by the implementation of the following measures among others:</p><ul><li>Total investment growth to account for 22-25% of the GDP by 2020 and 25% by 2030;</li><li>Increase in the share of research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures to 1.7% of the GDP by 2020 and 2.5% by 2030;</li><li>Average annual growth rate of exports of 7.2% by 2020 and 6.8% by 2030; and</li><li>A 10% share of advanced technology products in total exports by 2020 and 15% by 2030. </li></ul><p>The main objectives include eGovernment measures, particularly those involving the effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the public administration. The concept of eGovernment and digital public services implies that high-quality services for citizens, including entrepreneurs, are to be provided by modern information technology (IT) solutions supporting a logical and coherent government IT system, developed and maintained with the cooperation of all actors at various levels of public administration.</p><p>A priority task in the field of eGovernment is to allow the widest possible range of public services to be provided digitally, thereby enabling citizens to handle their businesses remotely. To that end, it will be necessary to ensure the interoperability of public IT systems and to computerise the internal processes of the administration.</p><p>In this field, the strategy sets out the following measures:</p><ul><li>Providing eServices relevant for citizens and entrepreneurs;</li><li>Creating a single information and eServices website for the government administration;</li><li>Introducing a uniform and secure system for identifying citizens (eID) in the eServices systems of the public administration;</li><li>Ensuring a dominant share of digital document flow in administration and economic trade;</li><li>Increasing access to public sector information (PSI), including through application programming interfaces (APIs) for software developers;</li><li>Adopting a standard for digital documentation management systems in public administration, guaranteeing an efficient exchange of information with the public administration&#x2019;s domain-specific systems; and</li><li>Integrating the eGovernment data processing infrastructure and the development of a State register system, ensuring the necessary reliability and availability of eGovernment systems and their integration.</li></ul><p>Other elements link this strategy to the European Commission&#x2019;s Digital Single Market Strategy, whose implementation is governed and monitored be the Ministry of Digital Affairs.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Operational Programme Digital Poland 2014&#x2013;2020 and European Funds for Digital Development 2021&#x2013;2027</p><p>The aim of the <a href="https://www.funduszeeuropejskie.gov.pl/media/1655/POPC_eng_1632015.pdf">Operational Programme (OP) Digital Poland 2014&#x2013;2020</a>, which is to be implemented until the end of 2023, is to strengthen the foundations for the development of a digital country, including broad access to high-speed internet, efficient and user-friendly public eServices, and an ever-increasing level of digital literacy in society. </p><p>This programme acknowledged that Poland was significantly lagging behind other Member States in the use of the development potential of ICT. In particular, the Council took note of:</p><ul><li>A low fixed broadband coverage;</li><li>A relatively low efficiency of public administration;</li><li>A relatively low level of use of eGovernment; and</li><li>A very low percentage of adults engaging in lifelong learning.</li></ul><p>The report recommended the development of broadband networks, and an improvement in the quality and efficiency of public services through digitalisation. The method for implementing eServices includes mechanisms to prevent the phenomenon of &#x2018;digitalisation bureaucracy&#x2019;, forcing the positive impact of projects on administrative processes, and to train as many people as possible in the use of ICT to improve their quality of life, also socially, and increase the competitiveness of the labour market. </p><p>By the end of 2021, over 1&#xa0;000&#xa0;000 households had been connected to high-speed internet. Human capital-related actions had resulted in 227&#xa0;540 people trained in using internet, including eServices, and more than 121&#xa0;300 acquiring increased digital competences. In the area of eAdministration, 99 new public eServices and 87 new databases accessible through API had been provided. </p><p>Under a combination of State and OP Digital Poland budget, the Polish government launched in 2017 the Nationwide Education Network (OSE), an initiative established to provide high-speed internet connections with at least 100 Mbps symmetrical to all schools and make more eResources available to teachers. The National Act establishing the OSE was adopted and entered into force in December 2017, and in 2018 the first educational centres were connected to the network. Since 2021, 90% of schools, over 20&#xa0;000, have subscribed to OSE services.</p><p>The new edition of the OP Digital Poland for the years 2021&#x2013;2027, which is named <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/ncbr-en/european-funds">European Funds for Digital Development</a> and is to be implemented until the end of 2030 with a similar thematic scope, was adopted by the government in January 2022 and approved in November by the European Commission. It contains the following components: broad access to ultra-fast internet, implementation of advanced and user-friendly public eServices, digital cross-sector cooperation, effective operation of the national cybersecurity system, support for digital skills of employees of public institutions, and digital availability and reuse of PSI.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Recovery and Resilience Facility for Poland </p><p>A part of the Polish Recovery and Resilience Plan aims to accelerate the digitalisation process of the country through the digital transformation of the public sector, the economy and the society. It&#xa0;consists of three sub-components, based on its specific objectives: </p><ul><li>Improving access to high-speed internet; </li><li>Developing and consolidating eServices, creating the conditions for the development of&#xa0;digital breakthrough technologies in the public sector, the economy and the society, as well as&#xa0;improving communication between public institutions, citizens and businesses; and</li><li>increasing security in the cyberspace, securing the data processing infrastructure and digitising the security services infrastructure.</li></ul><p>The above-mentioned activities are expected to promote the digital transition by developing the Next Generation Access broadband infrastructure, enhancing the use of digital tools in the public sector and boosting eCompetences in society (companies, public administration, teachers and students). The plan should also contribute to optimising cybersecurity, improving data processing efficiency and upgrading the infrastructure of State services responsible for security. Finally, the potential deployment of&#xa0;innovative next generation cloud solutions is expected to create stable and sustainable cloud infrastructures.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-451.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

This strategic document defines government actions aimed to develop the public administration using modern digital technologies and, as a result, improve the functioning of the State, while creating conditions that facilitate citizens&#x2019; communications with the public administration, and the use of information resources and shared solutions for their needs. In other words, the main objective of the PZIP is to modernise the public administration with the use of digital technologies, thus improving the efficiency of the State and the quality of the relations between the administration, citizens and other stakeholders. </p><p>Currently, the Ministry of Digital Affairs is working on a new digital transformation strategy. The document will be oriented towards the targets of the Digital Decade Policy Programme and the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) indicators. The strategy should be adopted in 2023. At the same time, the Ministry of Digital Affairs has advanced preparations and started the drafting of the National Digital Decade Strategic Roadmap with a view to submitting it to the European Commission by 9 October 2023.		</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">State Information Architecture </p><p>In 2018, the Ministry of Digital Affairs in cooperation with other institutions, created the <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-zintegrowanej-informatyzacji-panstwa">State Information Architecture</a> and entrusted it with the task to organise the IT systems and adopt a method for managing their development in accordance with the guidelines of the PZIP.</p><p>The State Information Architecture contains principles, standards, models and management processes, as well as elements necessary to implement the digital vision of the State covering legal, organisational, semantic and technical layers. The developed concept allows for an agile approach to the process of organising and expanding the architecture of the State&#x2019;s information systems. </p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">State Information Architecture </p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/architektura-informacyjna-panstwa">State Information Architecture</a> consists of a vision of the future architecture and models, standards and documentation, which is the basis for planning development and ensuring the consistency of IT activities undertaken by various institutions.

It aims to develop an ecosystem in which a large amount of good quality data will allow for the development of innovative solutions, increase the transparency of the activities of administrative bodies and increase the quality of research, accelerating scientific progress.</p><p>In 2019, a new project called Open Data Plus was inaugurated as a continuation of the project &#x2018;Open data - Access, standard, education&#x2019;. Under the project, new datasets were released through API and two new tools were established within the Ministry of Digital Affairs to support the opening of public data, i.e. the Open Data Laboratory (technical and legal advice) and the Open Data Academy (trainings). The Open Data Plus project was completed in 2022.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Open Data Standards </p><p>Opening public data makes public administration activities more transparent and allows civic control thereover. In 2018, the Ministry of Digital Affairs published <a href="https://dane.gov.pl/media/ckeditor/2019/07/04/open-data-good-practice-guide.pdf">guidelines</a> to prepare and share data for reuse. The guidelines concern the API standard, the security standard, the technical standard and the legal standard. The Ministry of Digital Affairs elaborated them as part of the project &#x2018;Open data &#x2013; Access, standard, education&#x2019; to ensure that data provided by the public administration would be of a higher quality. Open data may now be reused for research or business purposes. </p><p>In 2019, open data standards were subject to extensive public consultations. Most of the proposals submitted during the consultations were implemented in the new versions of the documents published in 2020. The technical standard and the API standard were also included as appendices to the Open Data Programme 2021&#x2013;2027. This will trigger an increase in the quality of data provided by the administration, and used in innovative products and services.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date. </p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>In the course of 2018, Poland created a solid base for strengthening cybersecurity within the country. Then, in October 2019, the Council of Ministers adopted, by means of a resolution, the <a href="https://www.gov.pl/attachment/6a4aafc6-e339-4cd5-a8e6-cd47257f02d8">Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019&#x2013;2024</a>. The State aims to increase the level of resilience to cyber threats and protection of information in the public, military and private sectors, while promoting knowledge and good practices to enable citizens to protect information better. </p><p>The strategy defines five specific objectives that should be fulfilled by the government: </p><ul><li>Developing the national cybersecurity system (including the adoption of the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act into the Polish legal system); </li><li>Increasing the level of resilience of information systems of the public administration and private sector, and achieving the capacity to effectively prevent and respond to incidents; </li><li>Increasing the national capacity in the area of cybersecurity technology; </li><li>Raising public awareness and competences in the area of cybersecurity; and</li><li>Ensuring the Republic of Poland has a strong international position in the area of cybersecurity.</li></ul><p>The objectives are executed through a dedicated action plan that was consulted within the government in 2020. The action plan identifies mechanisms and measures to strengthen Poland&#x2019;s cybersecurity capabilities by 2024. The pandemic showed that there is a need to rethink some previously proposed actions, such as addressing an increasing number of incidents inter alia in the healthcare sector. Moreover, the action plan needs to be fully in line with the actions to be implemented as part of the national Recovery and Resilience Plan (which is currently expecting to be accepted by the European Commission). </p><p>The strategy is in line with the obligations laid down in the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive with regard to the adoption of the national cybersecurity strategies by Member States. It also establishes an effective public-private partnership (Programme for Cooperation in Cybersecurity) with global and national technological companies that aims to strengthen cooperation in areas such as information sharing on incidents or vulnerabilities, education, cyber hygiene, etc.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Interconnection of Base Registries </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Efficient State Strategy 2020 </p><p>According to the <a href="https://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WMP20130000136">Efficient State Strategy 2020</a>, high interoperability of all IT systems and public registers is a fundamental condition for the implementation of common standards for electronic communication in the public sector and for the provision of reference data for current office work. The possibility of automatic verification of data provided by persons using public services with reference data from public registers will allow to improve the current work of public entities, which are obliged to perform the tasks specified in the law, and at the same time will speed up the settlement of matters. It is necessary to introduce and enforce principles for limiting to the necessary minimum the range of data which will be required from the citizen when dealing with official matters. Units keeping registers must have the obligation of mutual exchange of information and direct information requests from registered entities should only be possible if the data obtained from other records are insufficient. Two-way communication between secondary and primary records (supplied directly with data obtained from the registered entities) should be provided. A modern and secure IT infrastructure, built on robust integrated tele-information systems, is now the basis for the functioning of offices and the exchange of information between offices and citizens, as well as the offices themselves and other public bodies.</p><p>The Personal Data Register (PESEL) shall be a reference set of data about citizens. Since 1 January 2022, government administration bodies, as well as law enforcement bodies, courts, organisational units of the prosecutor&#x2019;s office, local government units and their bodies that keep a public register using ICT systems have to verify the data entered with the data in PESEL.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Reinforcement of Data Reference in Basic Registers </p><p>The formal designation of registers containing reference master data is planned in the amendment to the Act on the Digitalisation of the Activities of Entities Performing Public Tasks.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Recommendations for Public Administration Registers - Good architectural and legislative practices</p><p>The Ministry of Digital Affairs has developed recommendations for people designing public administration registers and the legal provisions that are the basis for the operation of these registers. The aim is to indicate good practices in the creation and development of registers and legal regulations regarding new and modified registers. The best practices concern registers providing reference master data and cooperation between registers, as well as the practical implementation of the Once-Only principle and the obligation to use reference data.

This legislation defines the national cybersecurity system, as well as the tasks and responsibilities of the entities in the system. The purpose of the national cybersecurity system is to ensure cybersecurity at national level, including the uninterrupted provision of essential services and digital services, by achieving an appropriate level of security for the information systems used to provide these services and by providing for incident handling. The act also provides for:</p><ul><li>The scope of the Polish National Cybersecurity Strategy;</li><li>The establishment of a single point of contact for cybersecurity run by the Minister competent for digitalisation;</li><li>The establishment of three Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) at national level and seven competent authorities responsible for cybersecurity within essential sectors in Poland (listed in the annex to the act). Based on the leading role of the three CSIRTs at national level (CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK and CSIRT GOV), the act also creates a coherent incident response system, with a certain and clear division of responsibilities; </li><li>The institution of the Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity, responsible for the coordination of activities and the implementation of the government policy in the field of cybersecurity; and</li><li>The addition of the public administration to the system with regard to incident handling and reporting.</li></ul><p>The government decided to maintain and develop its decentralised approach towards a governance structure of its cybersecurity system. There is a clear division of responsibilities and capabilities between all the involved institutions established pursuant to the act. That way, the act allows the creation of an efficient, comprehensive system enabling stakeholders to detect, prevent and mitigate the impact of incidents that affect Polish national interests, while contributing to crucial societal and economic activities.  </p><p>In this context, Poland has almost completed the identification and designation of operators of essential services. Also, a legal act (secondary legislation) &#x2013; an Ordinance of the Minister of Digital Affairs on Organisational and Technical Conditions for Entities Providing Cybersecurity Services and the Internal Organisational Structures of Operators of Essential Services Responsible for Cybersecurity &#x2013; was amended due to market needs.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Act on the Protection of Personal Data </p><p>The initial Act on the Protection of Personal Data was adopted on 29 August 1997 and later amended.

Furthermore, it defined cases where transferred data must be supplied with a qualified electronic signature. </p><p>In 2017, the Law on Public Procurement was amended again to include the changes introduced by the <a href="https://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=wdu20160001579" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification</a><span resource="https://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=wdu20160001579" property="eli:title" content="Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification"/> of 5 September 2016.</p><p>On 1 January 2021, a new <a href="https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2019/2019" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Public Procurement Law</a><span resource="https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2019/2019" property="eli:title" content="Public Procurement Law"/> came into force.

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>Law on Electronic Communications </p><p>Poland has been striving to implement Directive (EU) 2018/1972 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code into the Polish legal system as soon as possible. The implementation of the European Electronic Communications Code in Poland is achieved through the adoption of two legal acts: a new substantive act (i.e. the Law on Electronic Communications or PKE, replacing the Law of 16 July 2004 on Telecommunications) and a separate act (i.e. the Act Introducing the Law on Electronic Communications or wPKE), which includes in its scope dozens of amendments to other acts. The main part of the provisions will enter into force six months after the date of promulgation of the act.</p><p>The presentation of the proposed laws, due to their broad scope, had to be preceded by a number of substantive and legislative analyses. The drafts were the subject of a wide consultation, both with the public administration, and with consumers and entrepreneurs. The PKE and wPKE bills have now completed the government legislative process. They have been submitted for the final stage of the procedure and are currently in the parliamentary legislative process. On 13 January 2023, the first reading of the bills was held in the Parliament, after which they were referred to the Committee on Digitalisation, Innovation and Emerging Technologies for further analysis. On 6 March 2023, the Committee held a public hearing on the bills. After the completion of the parliamentary procedures and votes, the bills will be forwarded to the President of the Republic of Poland for signature. The PKE and the wPKE signature was planned in the first half of 2023. Immediately after publication, the acts will be notified to the European Commission.</p><p>Poland aims to guarantee the highest quality of the regulations implementing the European Electronic Communications Code. The provisions covered by the PKE and the wPKE will ensure a comprehensive regulation of the electronic communications market and will have a significant impact on the welfare of consumers. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-601.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Its goal is to accelerate and further digitise the investment and construction process. The act regulates the functioning of the <a href="https://e-budownictwo.gunb.gov.pl/">government application</a> for the submission of construction process applications. Currently, applications are submitted as an electronic document via this portal. </p><p>Furthermore, the provisions on the Electronic Central Register of Persons Holding Building Licenses (e-CRUB System) entered into force on 1 August 2022, while the regulations introducing the Digital Book of Building Objects (c-KOB System) and the Electronic Construction Journal System (EDB System), replacing these documents in paper form, entered into force on 1 and 27 January 2023, respectively.</p><p>Currently, work is underway on another amendment to the Construction Law. Based on the draft published on 3 October 2022, it provides for, among others, the acceleration of the existing changes, and the complete digitalisation of the investment and construction process (submitting applications and notifications, setting up a building logbook, issuing a construction log, drawing up a construction project, etc.). To that end, the Construction Design Database and the System for Handling Administrative Proceedings in the Construction Industry will be created.</p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Artificial Intelligence (AI) </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-607.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>Artificial Intelligence Act</p><p>Poland, as a Member State of the EU, is involved in the negotiations and, currently, the trilogue process to approve the Artificial Intelligence Act. This act will be directly applicable in Polish national law and jurisdiction. As a result, no local legislative initiative in the domain of AI will be needed, except for the establishment of a local authority exclusively entitled to be the executive body to enforce AI matters locally as they will appear in the text of the Artificial Intelligence Act as finally approved. </p><p>In parallel, Poland is engaged in a negotiation process in the Council of Europe for approving the new Convention on artificial intelligence, human rights, democracy and rule of law. After ratification of the Convention, local laws could need to be completed with specific measures to ensure that the Convention is properly implemented and enforced.   </p><p>After 2023, i.e. the first short-term implementation period, Poland also plans to review the implementation of its AI Development Policy and modify it, if necessary. In addition, Poland is involved in the work of the OECD Expert Group on AI (AIGO) aimed at internationally coordinate AI policy, as well as in the work to implement the Recommendations of UNESCO on the Ethics of AI. The latter establish non-binding legal instruments, but binding provisions in local national laws could turn out be necessary to ensure their effectiveness. </p><p>Finally, Poland expects the upcoming results of the work of other international organisations (such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation in the domain of intellectual property for AI, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law in the domain of data transactions for AI and the World Trade Organisation in the domain of digital trade for codes of AI). This input will be used by experts to conclude the drafting proposal for the negotiation process of Member States in these international organisations.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Distributed Ledger Technologies </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Big Data </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Cloud Computing </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Internet of Things (IoT) </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-performance Computing </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">High-speed Broadband Connectivity </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;"><img src="../html/img/32-613.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The services provided by the mCitizen application are the result of cooperation between the Ministry of Digital Affairs, and many public and private institutions. </p><p>In 2022, the mCitizen application integrated the Diia.pl service, allowing Ukrainian citizens who have arrived on the territory of the Republic of Poland in the period starting from 24 February 2022 and whose stay on the territory of the Republic of Poland has been recognized as legal to confirm their identity in the EU. Diia.pl allows Ukrainian citizens to download personal data from a dedicated register, store it in encrypted form on their mobile device and present it to others to confirm their identity. </p><p>Furthermore, users of the application have access to a service allowing citizens to easily apply for financial support from the State in connection with the energy and heating crisis as well as to a service enabling to send information about an event that may have an adverse impact on the environment.</p><p>In January 2023, additional documents were added: a pensioner&#x2019;s card, an attorney ID card (confirming the professional qualifications of the attorney) and a parliamentary ID card making it easier for deputies to perform their duties resulting from their parliamentary mandate. </p><p>Currently, mCitizen is not only a mobile application on smartphones, but also an extensive website available at mobywatel.gov.pl.

The system is a database that collects information about the availability of fixed-line internet services on the basis of notifications from customers and internet service providers. It facilitates access to broadband internet services for consumers and enables providers of these services to adjust network expansion plans to the real needs of customers. </p><p>Furthermore, on 1 January 2023 the provisions of the Regulation on the Inventory of Telecommunications Infrastructure and Services entered into force. The inventory is public and is a source of reliable data on the coverage of telecommunications infrastructure and networks, available to all interested entities. It also provides information on the route of fibre-optic and other cable lines providing or enabling broadband internet access. The inventory allows for a significant improvement of the planning and construction of public telecommunications networks, including the rationalisation of their location by considering the route of existing networks. Entrepreneurs and local government units obtain information allowing more effective investment in the construction of telecommunications infrastructure. As a result, the availability of broadband internet access for end users increases, which in turn has a positive impact on the development of commercial and public services provided in electronic form and other IT applications in society.
