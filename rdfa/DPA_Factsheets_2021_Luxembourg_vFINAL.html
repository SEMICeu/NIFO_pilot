The goal is promoting transversal digital accessibility, developing user-centred services, offering attractive online public services and investing in citizens&apos; trust in online State services.</p><p>Furthermore, the strategy analyses the essential conditions for the central public administration so as to enable it to respond effectively to the needs of society. The overarching objectives in the digital context are to facilitate the transition to an efficient paperless administration and to have an IT environment conducive to new ways of working. In addition, the strategy underlines the importance of being able to rely on a central IT partner who is competent, agile and reliable. To this aim, the CTIE aims to strengthen its digitalisation services, develop cutting-edge infrastructures and further guarantee very high levels of security and reliability.</p><p>The Governing Council also mandated the inter-ministerial Committee for Digitalisation to coordinate the implementation of this strategy.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Einfach L&#xeb;tzebuerg</p><p>The government has been committed to administrative reform and simplification for several years now and much progress has already been made, notably under the programme <a href="https://fonction-publique.public.lu/fr/plus/actualites/articles-actualites/2017/04/20170403_Einfach-Letzebuerg.html"><em>Einfach L&#xeb;tzebuerg</em></a>.

For its calls for solutions, the Ministry for Digitalisation has opted to make the widest possible use of the innovation partnership, which allows a broader participation of external players thanks to a more open public procurement procedure which is articulated in different phases.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p>In 2019, the Ministry for Digitalisation set up a working group which established an effective governance model for the NIF in 2020.

The electronic signature must also ensure the signatory is identified and show the latter&apos;s obvious consent to the content of the deed&#x201d;, and 2) an eSignature &#x201c;supported by a qualified certificate, which must be created with a secure signature creation device under the sole control of the subscriber&#x201d;.</p><p>Certification service providers can only issue certificates with the approval of the National Accreditation and Supervision Authority. Approved (qualified) certificates are valid for a maximum duration of three years and must be archived by the certification service provider for at least 10 years. The certification providers also have to undergo periodic external security audits.</p><p>eSignatures supported by a qualified certificate have the same legal validity as handwritten signatures, and the eCommerce act rendered void all laws and regulations that challenged the validity of a contract on the grounds that it was signed electronically.</p><p>The act&apos;s primary importance resided in the recognition of eSignatures and eContracts. Unlike the directive it was based on, it did not use the term &#x2018;advanced&#x2019; eSignature but rather recognised a &#x2018;qualified&#x2019; level of eSignature. It also differs from the directive and similar legislation in other Member States, insofar as it legally recognised electronic wills and electronic deeds and implemented the customer&apos;s right to withdraw from an electronic contract within seven days of its creation, free of questions and penalties, with full reimbursement of any money paid to the seller.</p><p>The act closely followed the directive in terms of information requirements from seller to customer, the seller&apos;s obligation to acknowledge reception of an order, the rules governing the liability and confidentiality requirements for certificate issuers (domestic and foreign), and provisions concerning the auditing and accreditation of certificate issuers.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">EU General Data Protection Regulation </p><p>In May 2018, the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a><span resource="https://gdpr.eu/" property="eli:title" content="EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)"/>  entered into force in the whole EU and therefore also in <a href="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2018/08/01/a686/jo">Luxembourg</a>.
