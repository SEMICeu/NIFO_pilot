The act comes in the wake of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 with the aim to clarify and strengthen the data-sharing rights and obligations of public bodies. The act paves the way for more efficient and cost-effective service delivery by public bodies by providing a clear legal basis for the sharing of personal data in certain circumstances. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden associated with the need for individuals to provide their personal data to numerous public bodies. The act allows for the sharing of personal data between public bodies where the sharing is for the performance of a function of either of the public bodies. In addition, the act provides for the establishment of a Personal Data Access Portal that would allow individuals to view their personal data as well as information in relation to any data breaches affecting their personal data and the data-sharing agreements under which their personal data is processed. Besides, the act allows the Minister to designate base registries for use by public bodies so that they can access personal data without having to collect it directly from service users. A base registry will have an owner who must ensure the personal data is accurate and up to date.</p><h2>Key enablers </h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Freedom of Information Act </p><p>A new <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0030/index.html" typeOf="eli:LegalResource" property="dct:relation">Freedom of Information (FOI) Act</a><span resource="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0030/index.html" property="eli:title" content="Freedom of Information (FOI) Act"/> came into force on 14 October 2014.

This network is a privately managed Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), wide area multi-carrier, national network (WAN) that supports multiple Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for public sector bodies. Key tenets of the GN are high speed, high capacity and resilient connections. The enhanced resilience that is built into GN through the use of MPLS is designed to ensure, in so far as is possible, that public sector bodies have several secure resilient paths both within and external to their own agency traffic be that voice, video or data. GN offers a number of potential cost and operational benefits: inter-agency collaboration and delivery of joined-up government services; access for all agencies to network capability and products/technology (regardless of size); execution of a number of standard day-to-day infrastructure services allowing agencies to focus on their core programmes and services; improvement of security for government information systems; internet access for agencies; and commercial advantages of an aggregated procurement approach, resulting in reduced costs and high quality services. </p><p>In 2018, through a coordinated and innovative nationwide approach to the delivery of connectivity, economies of scale have been achieved with standardised services to agencies in cities, towns and more remote locations where previously only limited services existed. The GN also supports centralised voice services and centralised corporate and guest Wi-Fi services, facilitating public service bodies to deploy secure wireless networks in multiple locations with minimum investment in infrastructure.</p><p>The GN was further enhanced in 2020 through the addition of a 28GHz Mesh Radio Network to facilitate connectivity at Dublin and Rosslare Ports.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Death Events Publishing Service</p><p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform runs the <a href="https://deathevents.gov.ie/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="death events publishing service" resource="https://deathevents.gov.ie/">Death Events Publishing Service</a>, distributing information on death events to a range of public sector bodies to take action as appropriate in relation to services that the deceased person(s) may have been receiving.

The platform is used by the public service including the OGP and its Central Purchasing Body (CPB) partners in the health, defence, education and local government sectors; central government Departments and agencies; local government and health sector organisations; and the wider public sector comprising semi-state organizations, both commercial and non-commercial, and voluntary and community groups that are funded by EU or state bodies. </p><p>eTenders currently has approximately 155&#xa0;600 registered entities &#x2013; 5&#xa0;900 Contracting Authorities and 149&#xa0;700 Economic Operators - and it is a key interface between the public, businesses and the government for public procurement. The OGP sets the policy on site content and functionality. However, day-to-day site management and maintenance, as well as its development, have been outsourced to a private platform service provider company.</p><p>eTenders displays, on a daily basis, all Irish public sector procurement opportunities currently being advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), as well as other lower-value contracts uploaded to the site from awarding authorities. At any given time, the portal will contain all open opportunities in the form of Tender Notices, Prior Indicative Notices (PIN) and Contract Award Notices (CAN). eTenders also provides associated tender documents (where available) which can be downloaded from the site.</p><p>eTenders has the functionality to allow Awarding Authorities to publish notices on the site which are then sent to the OJEU automatically. Other functionalities include: facility for conducting online clarifications via Q&amp;A; online submission of tenders; user and notice management facilities to awarding authorities; and email alerts and response management facilities to suppliers. Comprehensive notice search and help functions are also available. </p><p>eTenders is central to the reform and ongoing digital transformation of public procurement. The service is free of charge to contracting authorities or suppliers. The eTenders site is also freely available for use by the public to view tender notices published by public Contracting Authorities.</p><p>Since 18 April 2019, central government contracting authorities and entities are required to receive and process eInvoices that comply with the European Standard on eInvoicing in public procurement. Since 18 April 2020, all contracting authorities and entities are required to receive and process eInvoices that comply with the European Standard on eInvoicing in public procurement.</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p>No&#xa0;particular infrastructure&#xa0;in this field has been reported to date.&#xa0; </p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Build to Share Applications</p><p>Build to Share Applications are built and maintained by the <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/6ee40f-office-of-the-government-chief-information-officer-ogcio/" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework" property="dct:relation" title="ogcio" resource="https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/6ee40f-office-of-the-government-chief-information-officer-ogcio/">OGCIO</a>, which delivers a suite of corporate support applications common across Departments.
