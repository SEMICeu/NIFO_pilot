The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="../html/img/32-135.png" alt="32-135.png" class="keepElement"/></p><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">&#xa0;Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022&#xa0;</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles).

Particularly, the provision of internal visibility and external interfaces for European public service to make administrative procedures available and accessible online (Principle 3 &#x2013; Recommendation 05) is partial and could be improved to reach the maximum score of 4. In addition, Belgium could increase its score on Principle 9 (Multilingualism) to reach the maximum score of 4 by enhancing its use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 &#x2013; Recommendation 16) and more specifically, the total number of language resources proposed to users. </p><p/><p property="dct:source" href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p property="dbo:areaTotal" content="Belgium&#x2019;s scores in Scoreboard 2 illustrate an overall good performance of the country with scores of 3 and 4 in all the interoperability layers.

The <a href="https://smartnation.be/">new &#x2018;Smart Nation&#x2019; Digital Strategy</a> of the Belgian federal government was published in 2022, as the preparatory work was concluded in early 2022, in cooperation with the Digital Minds for Belgium, the group of experts from the public and private sectors advising the Secretary of State for Digitalisation to commonly draft a convergent, ambitious and inclusive digital strategy. </p><p>The strategy includes ten ambitions:</p><ul><li>Internet access becomes a fundamental right for everyone;</li><li>All citizens will acquire digital skills;</li><li>Civil servants will acquire advanced digital skills;</li><li>All citizens receive digital citizenship with access to all online public services;</li><li>Belgium will promote the emergence of the data economy;</li><li>Online democracy will be protected and safeguarded;</li><li>Belgian governments will create the conditions for economic actors to digitalize;</li><li>Belgium will be leading in eHealth and its applications in artificial intelligence (AI);</li><li>Belgian governments will support Belgian digital champions; and</li><li>Digital transformation will benefit the environment.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Federal eGovernment Strategy for the Social Sector (2009-present)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ksz-bcss.fgov.be/en">Federal eGovernment Strategy for the Social Sector </a>aims to create a single virtual public administration while respecting the privacy of users, as well as the specificities and competences of all government bodies and administrative layers. Its main objective is to improve the delivery of public services for citizens and businesses by rendering it faster, more convenient, less constraining and more open. </p><p>The current strategy is outlined as follows: </p><ul><li>Formulation of specific objectives, such as optimal service delivery to citizens, limitation of administrative burden, and optimisation of the efficiency and effectiveness of public services;</li><li>Explicit choice to opt for stakeholders&#x2019; collaboration to create added value for users of eGovernment services;</li><li>Common vision for the use of information in terms of information modelling, mandatory reporting of supposed errors, electronic exchange of information and single collection of information;</li><li>Use of a common vision for information security and protection of privacy;</li><li>Maximum use of common elements for networks, electronic identification (eID), interconnected middleware and related basic services;</li><li>Role of the <a href="https://www.ksz-bcss.fgov.be/en">Crossroads Bank for Social Security</a> (CBSS) as driver for eGovernment development in the social sector; and</li><li>Establishment of a strong partnership among all social security institutions.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Communication Campaign on eBox</p><p>In February 2019, a <a href="http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&amp;la=F&amp;cn=2019022708&amp;table_name=loi" typeOf="schema:ContactPoint" property="dct:relation">new law</a><span resource="http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&amp;la=F&amp;cn=2019022708&amp;table_name=loi" property="dct:title" content="new law"/> introduced <a href="https://www.passezaudigital.be/ebox">eBox</a>. eBox is an electronic mailbox that can be used by public actors to send electronic communications to Belgian citizens, and registered companies and organisations, including registered mail. During the second half of 2019, the Belgian government developed a communication campaign on social media to promote private partners in the eBox ecosystem. These private partners offer to their clients the possibility to consult government documents with their applications. During this campaign, the following partners were promoted: Doccle, bpost bank and Trusto. In addition, now <em>Mijn Burgerprofiel</em> (by the Flemish region) and KBC (a bank) are also eBox-private partners/Human Interface Providers, offering the possibility to consult government documents on their applications. Subsequently, in December 2019, the government released a communication campaign on national television and radio aimed to raise awareness around eBox. In 2020, the Flemish government and local governments also started to use eBox as their electronic mailbox for sending official government documents.  </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Digital Wallonia Strategy (2015-2024)</p><p>On 6 December 2018, the Walloon government adopted the second version of its <a href="https://www.digitalwallonia.be/fr/publications/2019-2024">Digital Wallonia Strategy</a> for the period 2019&#xf02d;2024. The strategy sets the direction to allow the region of Wallonia to seize the socio-economic opportunities of the digital transformation. Just like the first version of 2015, which was based on the contributions of more than 100 actors and organisations, Digital Wallonia 2019&#xf02d;2024 is the result of the work of the Digital Wallonia Champions.</p><p>This strategy is structured around five major goals: </p><ol><li>Digital sector: the goal is to create a strong technological sector by means of a growth programme, which aims to give Wallonia&#x2019;s digital sector an international dimension; </li><li>Digital economy: the goal is to increase the digital capabilities of companies, which is essential for the development of connected commerce;</li><li>Connected and intelligent territory: the goal is to achieve full high-speed connectivity in Wallonia; </li><li>Open utilities: the goal is to foster open and transparent digital public services; and </li><li>Skills and employment: the goal is to develop Wallonia&#x2019;s citizens&#x2019; digital skills.</li></ol><p>More than 20 projects have been implemented as part of the Digital Wallonia Strategy. For example, <a href="https://www.digitalwallonia.be/fr/publications/digitalwallonia4-ai-home">Digital Wallonia 4 AI</a> is now the roadmap for the development of AI. Moreover, while <a href="https://www.digitalwallonia.be/en/tags/industry-of-the-future-2020#digitalSectors">Digital Wallonia Industry of the Future</a> is the framework for the adoption of the Industry 4.0 by factories of the manufacturing sectors, Digital Wallonia Giga Region defines the priorities to offer high-speed fixed and mobile networks to all citizens and companies in Wallonia.</p><p>The strategy marked the Walloon government&#x2019;s stated ambition to transform Wallonia into a connected and smart territory, where technological companies are recognised as leaders and as the driving force behind the region&#x2019;s successful industrial transformation. </p><p>In 2019, the new regional government confirmed Digital Wallonia as the digital roadmap for Wallonia. Consequently, the Digital Wallonia Strategy is now fully integrated into the political declaration of the Walloon government. Digital Wallonia also contributes to the digital objectives of the <a href="https://www.wallonie.be/sites/default/files/2019-09/declaration_politique_regionale_2019-2024.pdf">Declaration of Regional Politics 2019&#x2013;2024</a> and <a href="https://www.wallonie.be/fr/plans-wallons/plan-de-relance-de-la-wallonie">Wallonia&#x2019;s Recovery Plan 2021&#x2013;2024</a>.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Master Plan and Digital Vision of the Ministry of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation</p><p>In May 2016, the government of the <em>F&#xe9;d&#xe9;ration Wallonie-Bruxelles</em> (FWB) <a href="http://www.federation-wallonie-bruxelles.be/index.php?id=strategie">signed</a> the first Master Plan of the Ministry of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation (MFWB), running until 2024.

The first pillar aims to work on the user experience, which includes both external users of the public service (e.g., citizens, non-marketers) and internal users. The second pillar concerns data, which are a relevant component of the entire digital approach. The third pillar is mainly internal and focuses on the digital workplace. The fourth pillar is dedicated to innovation and the fifth concerns digital governance. The sixth pillar targets the digital culture of the organisation, including the acquisition of digital skills and management changes. The seventh pillar is devoted to the necessary resources, including the information technology (IT) infrastructure. Finally, the eighth and most important pillar is the digital platform, consisting of all IT capabilities of the MFWB. </p><p>The government of the French community also included a chapter on digitalisation in its global strategy named <a href="http://www.federation-wallonie-bruxelles.be/index.php?eID=tx_nawsecuredl&amp;u=0&amp;g=0&amp;hash=2fd6adb4222e4ddeab9423ac8b0186822a14d8fe&amp;file=fileadmin/sites/portail/uploads/Illustrations_documents_images/A._A_propos_de_la_Federation/4._Ministere/4.3._Plan_du_management/FEDE_2025_Brochure_globale.pdf.">2020&#x2013;2025 Strategy of the Government of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation</a>.

Description automatically generated" class="keepElement"/>Flanders eGovernment Strategy </p><p>As to the Flemish Region, the eGovernment Strategy is under the responsibility of the Minister&#x2011;President of the Flemish government. It is now managed by the Flanders Digital Agency, which was created in 2021 by the merger of the Flanders Information Agency, and the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Department of the Flemish government. </p><p>This agency was responsible for the eGovernment programme <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/praktisch/digitale-werkplek/programma-vlaanderen-radicaal-digitaal">Radically Digital Flanders</a> (<em>Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaal</em>), an investment programme that ran from 2015 till 2017. The programme substantially increased the digital maturity of the Flemish government digital service provision. It also ensured that the Once-Only data collection principle (known in Flanders as the MAGDA principle) was adopted by the whole Flemish administration. In 2021, a follow-up investment programme, <a href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/uw-overheid/werking-en-structuur/hoe-werkt-de-vlaamse-overheid/informatie-en-communicatie/vlaanderen-radicaal-digitaal-ii">Radically Digital Flanders II</a><em> </em>(<em>Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaal II</em>), was launched, again investing EUR 30 million in the creation of a state-of-the-art digital government. As part of Flemish Resilience (<em>Vlaamse Veerkracht</em>), the Flemish recovery plan after the COVID-19 crisis, further substantial investments are also being made in the digitalisation of the Flemish administration and the local authorities. A key policy element in this eGovernment policy is the continued development of authentic sources of information (base registries). These are databases that can be used to obtain complete, correct and up-to-date data on businesses, natural persons, addresses, plots, buildings, maps, etc. A comprehensive system of Flemish authentic data sources and related services is in the process of being built. The Flemish eGovernment strategy 2014-2019 aimed to &#x2018;radically digitally&#x2019; transform the Flemish administration, by opting for a digital-first approach in the (increasingly mobile) delivery of new (or existing) Flemish government services. This aims to turn the Flemish government into a state&#x2011;of-the-art digital government, by becoming more data-driven and further adopting the Once-Only principle to proactively deliver digital services to citizens and enterprises.</p><p>In 2022, the Flemish government adopted the <a href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/digitaal-vlaanderen/vlaamse-digitale-strategie/vlaamse-datastrategie">Flemish Data Strategy</a> to increase the general data maturity of the Flemish administration and, in a broader perspective, further develop the data economy and data society in Flanders. An interesting element in this strategy is the establishment of personal data vaults. To that end, Flanders is the first government to work with the data vaults of the <a href="https://solid.mit.edu/">Solid project</a> of Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web (www). </p><p>In the same year, the <a href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/digitaal-vlaanderen/vlaamse-digitale-strategie/digitale-dienstverleningsstrategie">Flemish Digital Government Service Delivery Strategy</a> was also adopted, aiming to improve quality, user-centricity and especially inclusiveness of digital service delivery by regional and local governments in Flanders.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eGovernment Strategy of the Brussels-Capital Region</p><p>In July 2019, the Brussels government brought forward the<a href="http://www.parlement.brussels/texte-de-la-declaration-de-politique-generale-du-gouvernement-bruxellois/"> policy</a> that, among other digital measures, seeks to address inequalities and poverty by automatically granting derivative rights resulting from the social status of the citizens. Furthermore, the new policy includes an entire section on the ambition of the Brussels Region to become a smart city. The transition towards becoming a smart city has multiple purposes:</p><ul><li>To democratise the access to digital wealth;  </li><li>To improve the quality, the performance and the synergies across public services;</li><li>To reduce the costs and the consumption of available resources; and</li><li>To streamline and improve the interactions between citizens and public administration. </li></ul><p>Aware of the exponential increase in IT costs generated by the societal evolution towards a more digital world, as accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Brussels government approved in 2020 the implementation of a new IT governance. Its aim is to better meet the needs of users while adopting a harmonised and coordinated approach to regional IT with a view, among other things, to achieving economies of scale and limiting its environmental impact.</p><p>Also in 2020, the government approved the Data Governance Strategy to coordinate, strengthen and professionalise data exchange within the Region and to ensure coherence across regional public administrations. The strategy includes:</p><ul><li>The establishment of a data governance structure called &#x2018;Regional Data Office&#x2019;;</li><li>The development of a Brussels Data Exchange Platform, aiming to carry out innovative data management and development projects, particularly of the &#x2018;big data&#x2019; type, for the benefit of public authorities; and</li><li>The creation of a &#x2018;Brussels Code of Governance&#x2019;.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Strategic Plan of the Steering Body for the Flemish Information and ICT Policy</p><p>In June 2020, a <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/digitale-overheid/stuurorgaan-vlaams-informatie-en-ict-beleid/stuurorgaan-vlaams-informatie-en-ict">Strategic Plan of the Steering Body for the Flemish Information and ICT Policy</a> was adopted by the Flemish government (VR 2020 2606 DOC.0643/1). The plan outlines the priorities with regards to information and ICT policy for the Flemish administration and local authorities for the period 2020&#xf02d;2024. The plan also implements the Radically Digital Flanders II investment programme, which has been in use since 2021 to support the realisation of the objectives of this strategic plan. The management and follow-up of the strategic plan is under the responsibility of the Steering Body for the Flemish Information and ICT Policy.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Belgian government signed the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government, thus re-affirming its commitment &#x2013; together with other EU Member States &#x2013; to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">BelgIF &#x2013; Belgium&#x2019;s National Interoperability Framework </p><p><a href="https://www.belgif.be/en">BelgIF</a> is Belgium&#x2019;s official National Interoperability Framework, to be followed by all levels of public administration in Belgium. </p><p>In line with the revised European Interoperability Framework (EIF), the Belgian federal government and the regions have agreed to use the twelve principles of the EIF as the basis for defining their interoperability.

This has allowed the DTO to:</p><ul><li>Communicate the DTO enterprise architecture in a standardised way;</li><li>Detect gaps in the existing DTO architecture;</li><li>Make use of the available Solution Architecture Templates to complete the DTO architecture; and</li><li>Compare the DTO architecture with the architecture of other Belgian and EU partners (provided their architecture is also built according to EIRA), and in this way detect gaps and overlaps between different architectures.</li></ul><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Charter on Open Data Use by Local Authorities</p><p>The Smart Flanders Initiative included the <a href="https://smart.flanders.be/open-data-charter/">Open Data</a> Charter, which establishes 20 principles, such as open-by-default and machine-readable data, enabling local authorities to foster an open data ecosystem. The Open Data Charter was approved in the summer of 2018 and ratified by 13 Flemish cities. To translate the Charter into practice, a dedicated document was developed with sample clauses to be used in tenders, concessions and contracts to make arrangements with suppliers about (linked) open data. The use of these formulations is recommended, so as to strive for a more joint approach to open data.</p><p>To effectively stimulate the movement towards open data, a broad support offer for local governments has been developed in the Smart Flanders Programme. For example, a handbook entitled <a href="https://smart.flanders.be/open-data-beleid/handboek-open-data/">&#x2018;Open Data for Local Governments&#x2019;</a>, published in 2021, provides policymakers with insight into the benefits of open data, and offers them a hands-on step-by-step plan for getting started with open data within their local government. In addition, a &#x2018;Quick Scan on Open Data&#x2019; questionnaire provides them with insight into growth opportunities towards a sustainable local open data policy.</p><h3 style="color: #0070c0;">eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">ITSME Agreement</p><p>In February 2021, <a href="https://michel.belgium.be/fr/les-autoritÃÂ©s-belges-renouvellent-le-contrat-itsme">BOSA</a> renewed the agreement with Belgian Mobile ID, the developer of the mobile identity app <a href="https://www.itsme.be/">ITSME</a>, for a period of three years.

The G-Cloud is a hybrid cloud service which uses services provided by private companies operating in public cloud environments and services hosted in government datacentres. The G-Cloud is managed by the government, while its expansion and operational functioning largely rely on private sector services. The Cloud Governance Board controls its implementation.</p><p>The development of this government-based community cloud is laid out in a joint roadmap. The first-generation G-Cloud services became operative in March 2015 and many improvements are still being implemented.</p><p>The G-Cloud services operate in four different domains. The services offer is gradually being extended and improved, based on the actual needs of the participating institutions. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) are all included. The G-Cloud programme also encompasses synergy initiatives undertaken by the government in the field of classic ICT. New services will be added upon availability. </p><p>&#x2018;Hard&#x2019; infrastructure services ensure that government applications are able to run in a reliable physical environment including datacentre housing, servers and storage. The complete virtual capacity can be flexibly modified in a fully managed IaaS environment. These services are supplemented by a &#x2018;soft&#x2019; infrastructure, which allows for high-quality back-ups, security and identity, as well as authorisation management. PaaS services mainly focus on developing the new software generation, namely cloud-enabled and cloud-native applications using the latest architecture.

The changes concerned the inclusion of the definition of eInvoice as well as its essential elements. Also, the new law introduced several amendments to the third chapter of the Law of 17 June 2016 concerning Concession Contracts. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">eInvoicing Legislation</p><p>In Belgium, the responsible entity for eInvoicing is BOSA. However, other public services at federal and regional levels may share part of the responsibility. </p><p>There is no overall legislation in place for the country as a whole. At federal level, the Law of 7 April 2019, published in the Belgian Monitor of 16 April 2019 and transposing Directive 2014/55/EU into national law, requires contracting authorities to receive and process electronic invoices, following the European standard. Despite not being mandatory, economic operators are encouraged to submit eInvoices, and central, regional as well as local contracting authorities and entities are encouraged to receive them. Differently, in Flanders B2G eInvoicing is mandatory for regional contracting authorities. </p><p>A <a href="https://einvoice.belgium.be/en">website</a> has been created by the Federal Agency for Administrative Simplification, which is now part of the Directorate-General Simplification and Digitalisation (FPS BOSA), to guide enterprises, private persons and governments through the concept of electronic invoicing and its future applications.</p><p>In 2016, the European Interoperability Framework Peppol was implemented in Belgium, with the Directorate-General Simplification and Digitalisation of BOSA taking up the role of Peppol Authority (PA) for Belgium.</p><p>The central gateway between the private and public sectors (B2G) is the <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/mercurius-en-peppol">Mercurius</a> platform, which acts as an electronic mailroom for invoices sent to all Belgian public entities. This platform is accompanied by a web portal, which allows public service suppliers who have not yet adopted eInvoicing to send their electronic invoices in the required structured format. For the receipt of incoming invoices, the Flemish Region has decided to collaborate with the federal level and to also use the Mercurius platform.</p><p>At federal level, the <a href="https://einvoice.belgium.be/en/article/convert-structured-invoices-pdf-hermes">Hermes Platform</a> was made available to companies in Belgium. This free tool will allow them to convert electronic XML invoices to PDF format. This should be seen as an incentive to initiate structured exchanges, while waiting for the IT sector to develop the appropriate reception and processing tools, and market them in attractive terms.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Law on the Acceptance of Bids, Information to Candidates and Tenderers, and Time Limits on Public Procurement and Several Public Works Contracts, Public Supply Contracts and Public Service Contracts </p><p>The legislation related to public procurement was <a href="https://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&amp;la=N&amp;table_name=wet&amp;cn=2013061701">amended</a> several times over the last few years.

In addition, it defines new concepts based on public procurement directives, namely electronic auctions and the Dynamic Purchasing System. </p><h2>Domain-Specific Legislation</h2><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Decree on Primary Care</p><p>The new <a href="http://docs.vlaamsparlement.be/pfile?id=1475222">Decree on Primary Care</a>, which was adopted by the plenary on 3 April 2019, lays down the provisions for the organisation of primary care in Flanders, and introduces a digital care and support plan for patients.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Amendments to the Telecommunications Act</p><p>In December 2021, a draft law modernising Belgium&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&amp;la=F&amp;table_name=loi&amp;cn=2005061332">telecommunications legislation</a> and transposing a significant part of the European rules was approved.

Since 2007, the federal government has recognised three private certification authorities complying with the required standards regarding qualified certificates, as defined in the Belgian eSignatures Act. Their certificates are used for certain eGovernment applications, in particular tax and social security eServices. Like the eID, these digital certificates contain certain identity data, the public key connected with the certificate holder, the public key usage, and the validity and category of the certificate.

The institutions of the Flemish-speaking Community were merged with those of the Flemish Region in 1980.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Steering Body for the Flemish Information and ICT Policy</p><p>In 2018, the <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/stuurorgaan-vlaams-informatie-en-ict-beleid">Steering Body for the Flemish Information and ICT Policy</a> became fully active as the main governance body for the Flemish information and ICT policy. In 2020, a new Strategic Plan for the Steering Body was adopted outlining the priorities with regard to information and ICT policy for the Flemish administration and local authorities for the period 2020&#xf02d;2024. In the framework of this strategic plan, a digital government security strategy and a digital government data strategy were defined, together with a digital government service delivery strategy. In 2023, an integrated Flemish digital strategy for the whole of the Flemish government, economy and society will be formulated.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Regional Units/Bodies</p><p>Regional eGovernment efforts are coordinated by dedicated units or bodies set up by the regional executives: the Flanders Digital Agency in Flanders, the eWBS in Wallonia and the Wallonia&#x2011;Brussels Federation, and the Brussels Regional Informatics Centre (BRIC) in the Brussels-Capital Region.</p><p>In 2020, the Walloon government decided to set up a Chief Information Officer function for the Walloon Public Service, in charge of addressing the challenges related to digital administration. This is a major strategic decision in the context of the digital transformation of the Walloon administration.  </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Governance Committees for the Brussels-Capital Region</p><p>To implement the new IT governance mentioned above, the Brussels-Capital Region has set up three committees:</p><ul><li>The IT Steering Committee, made up of the ten regional institutions with the largest IT budgets, which is responsible for ensuring transversality by integrating the realities of the various regional administrations, and aiming to harmonise and reuse all types of shareable components available for the implementation of IT projects within the Region;</li><li>The Regional Committee for Advice and Validation of Architecture and Data Exchange, which is responsible for guaranteeing IT architectural coherence based on the different regional realities and market trends; and</li><li>The Digital and IT Steering Committee, which is responsible for identifying the main challenges facing the Brussels-Capital Region in terms of digital transition.</li></ul><p>From now on, BRIC, currently IT services producer and provider, will embody this new open and collaborative governance and become the orchestrator of IT services for the entire Brussels ecosystem. As such, it sits on all three committees. In this context, BRIC is setting up a single Citizen Relationship Management (CRM Salesforce) Platform for the Brussels-Capital Region. This platform will make available to citizens and companies innovative and efficient services based on data from authentic sources, in compliance with the Once-Only principle and the GDPR. It will ensure coherence and mutualisation, both in terms of project implementation and the management of operations necessary for the proper functioning of the platform. The deployment of 16 projects within this platform by 2024 is financed by the Recovery and Resilience Facility.</p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Wallonia Digital Agency </p><p>At the end of 2014, the Walloon Agency of Telecommunications became the <a href="http://www.awt.be/">Walloon Digital Agency</a> (<em>Agence du num&#xe9;rique</em>), a subsidiary of the Enterprise and Innovation Agency, which is in charge of promoting the development of ICT in the region, while also providing operational and expert support to Walloon administrations and municipalities. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Brussels Regional IT Procurement Office</p><p>The Brussels government has asked BRIC to set up a Regional IT Procurement Office for all IT purchases in the region. The expected benefits are:</p><ul><li>To increase the negotiating power with the main IT suppliers and thus make substantial savings;</li><li>To limit the environmental impact of IT equipment, in particular through the development of a circular management of the latter; and</li><li>To streamline the tools, software, infrastructure and IT architecture.</li></ul><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Flanders Digital Agency </p><p>The main responsibility of the Flanders Digital Agency is to determine the strategic aims and priorities for the transformation of the Flemish government into a data-driven government, while taking part in eGovernment projects in an advisory and supportive role. The Agency is also in charge of developing eGovernment-related knowledge and skills, supporting digital transformation, coordinating and providing incentives, and creating a generic eGovernment infrastructure to facilitate cooperation among the different entities within the Flemish administration and the local authorities. This generic eGovernment infrastructure consists of a number of eGovernment building blocks (eID and trust services, electronic documents, eProcurement, authentic sources, etc.) that can be used as shared systems to improve existing (electronic) service delivery and streamline government operations. The Agency also provides additional funding for cross-departmental eGovernment projects (<a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/radicaal-digitaal">Flanders Radically Digital II</a> projects) and coordinates the government digitalisation projects that are part of Flemish Resilience, the Flemish recovery plan after the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/digitaal-vlaanderen/het-vlaams-datanutsbedrijf/the-flemish-data-utility-company">Flemish Data Utility Company</a>, created at the end of 2022, wants to stimulate citizens&#x2019; trust in sharing data by focusing on responsible and secure data sharing, as well as to support the Flemish economy by making data more findable and exchangeable, and by building bridges between citizens, companies and associations for better cooperation. The company acts as a neutral third partner and catalyst for innovative data initiatives to stimulate economic and social prosperity in Flanders. </p><p class="subtitle" style="color: #00b0f0; font-size: 18px;">Artificial Intelligence for the Common Good Institute</p><p>In the spring of 2021, the Brussels Region, the Universit&#xe9; libre de Bruxelles (ULB) and the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) launched the <a href="https://fari.brussels/">Artificial Intelligence for the Common Good Institute (FARI)</a>. FARI and BRIC are working together on a roadmap for the development of AI in the Brussels Region. The objective is to have a development framework, to guarantee the coherence of projects and also to rely on knowledge sharing. The collaboration concerns:</p><ul><li>Support services (e.g. training and development of PoCs of software solutions) to profit and non-profit organisations, and public organisations in areas such as AI education, healthcare and employment in the Brussels Region;</li><li>Creation of a multidisciplinary team of experts on AI data and robotics to support the public services provided by the Brussels-Capital Region and the digital transition; and</li><li>AI services to local authorities, and in particular support to the digital twins, as well as training and consulting activities related to citizen services.</li></ul><p/><p>6</p><p>Cross-border Digital </p><p>Public Administration Services </p></div><div resource="http://example.org/nifo/structure/Belgium" typeOf="cpsv:FormalFramework"><h1>Cross border Digital Public Administration Services for Citizens and Businesses</h1><p>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to &#x2018;life and travel&#x2019;, as well as &#x2018;doing business&#x2019; abroad.
