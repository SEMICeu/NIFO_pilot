The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-774.x-emf" alt="32-774.x-emf" /></p><p> Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022 </a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Malta in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-779.x-emf" alt="32-779.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Maltese results in Scoreboard 1 stand for an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles. Compared to 2021, Malta performed better under Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility), showing alignment with the European average. Potential areas of improvement relate to the implementation of Principles 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) and 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), for which the score of 3 could be further improved. In addition, Malta could increase its score on Principle 3 (Openness) and Principle 4 (Reusability), focusing on the reuse and share of information and data when implementing European public services. Regarding the latter two principles, Malta shows a decrease of the performance compared to the previous year. Such reduction will need to be further monitored with the results of 2023. </p><p><img src="img/32-783.x-emf" alt="32-783.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Malta’s scores in Scoreboard 2 illustrate an overall good performance of the country with scores of 3 and 4 in all the interoperability layers. Areas of improvement to strengthen the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 concern interoperability governance, integrated public service governance and legal interoperability. More specifically, with regard to the interoperability governance, Malta has a middle performance in the instances of participation in standardisation works (Recommendation 24). Finally, to match the European average on legal interoperability, Malta could pay more attention to ensuring that legislation is screened by means of ‘interoperability checks’ in order to identify any barriers to interoperability (Recommendation 27). </p><p><img src="img/32-787.x-emf" alt="32-787.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Malta’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with internal information sources and services, base registries and open data. However, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to the conceptual model itself, as well as with regards to external information sources and services. Precisely, the lack of a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components and putting in place the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining public services (Conceptual Model - Recommendation 35) hinders the overall Maltese score on the conceptual model. Additionally, the use of external information sources and services while developing public services could improve the score on the external information sources and services category (External information sources and services – Recommendation 45).</p><p><img src="img/32-791.x-emf" alt="32-791.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Malta on Cross-Border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show a good performance of the country. Particularly, Malta has the maximum score of four for 13 indicators out of 19. However, Malta has still margin for improvement in relation to six indicators where the country obtains a lower performance, such as Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility). For instance, efforts could focus on increasing the compliance with the European accessibility standards of the Directive on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public-sector bodies (Recommendation 14).</p><p>Additional information on Malta’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><a id="_Toc1035577"></a><a id="_Toc1474948"></a></p><p><img src="img/32-796.png" alt="32-796.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc140675553"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-800.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" />National Digital Strategy </p><p>The <a href="https://www.maltadigitali.mt/">Malta Digitali 2022–2027</a> (National Digital Strategy), launched in November 2022, sets out the Maltese government’s vision on how it intends to maintain its momentum as a global digital leader and a champion of emerging technologies. The strategy lays the foundations for Malta’s transition towards a more digitalised society and economy leading to better public services, more productive businesses and citizens that are able to harness the immense opportunities brought about by digitalisation. The National Digital Strategy thus sets out how the government shall act not only in its traditional role as promoter and regulator, but also as the enabler, incubator and accelerator for change towards digitalisation. In order to achieve this vision, several goals have been identified. Malta is committed to work towards them while the strategy is being implemented. These goals are supported by six guiding principles that encompass how digitalisation should be applied and focused. Consequently, one of the strategy’s focal points addresses the diverse needs, requirements, and expectations of various cohorts of Malta’s society and economy. In particular,  the way digitalisation can make a real difference in daily life, the digital opportunities that arise, and the related challenges that will need to be addressed from a three-pillar perspective - society, business and government will be analysed. Another focal point of the strategy looks at how digitalisation can shape and strengthen Malta’s economy. More specifically, this is being addressed through a strategic course of action that investigates growth through innovation and further digital strategic focus on various sectors of social and economic importance. Government plays a leading role by further investing in emerging technologies, such as by setting up a digital innovation hub (DIH), providing access to government open datasets, expanding funding for research and innovation (R&amp;I), and cultivating an ecosystem that is conducive to and supportive of digitalisation. Undoubtedly, attention must also be paid to a number of key enablers, among which there are those related to regulation and legislation, digital infrastructure and funding, as well as cybersecurity, data and eSkills (Digital Skills).</p><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Maltese government signed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other EU Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle">New Strategy for the Public Service – Achieving a Service of Excellence</p><p>In December 2021, the public service launched a new strategy for the next five years, called <a href="https://publicservice.gov.mt/en/Documents/Achieving-A-Service-of-Excellence-2021.pdf">Achieving a Service of Excellence</a>. A steering committee headed by the Principal Permanent Secretary was set up and four working groups reporting to this committee were formed: three groups were exclusively focused on the three main pillars this strategy is based on - people, technology and services, while the fourth group was focused on drafting the final document. The vision outlines what the 45 main initiatives and eleven strategic objectives captured in the plan aim to achieve – a seamless public service that is accountable, sustainable and that continually strives to provide a service of excellence. A study on public service renewal commissioned in 2020 highlighted the need to focus the efforts on improving the quality of services, the accountability towards clients, as well as the sustainability as a large organisation. Public service values are intended to inspire respect, promote ethical conduct, acknowledge the highest integrity standards, safeguard clients’ rights and promote a culture that embraces honesty, correctness and professionalism. In order to support these values, a set of guiding principles have been identified, i.e. effective leadership, holistic people management and employee empowerment, ongoing measurement, continuous improvement, decision making and policy making and client centricity. A strategic plan with tangible outcomes and milestones was compiled and for each initiative and strategic objective a champion has been identified.</p><p class="subtitle">Centralised Digital Enabling Services Policy</p><p>The <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GMICT_P_0121_Centralised_Digital_Enabling_Services.pdf">policy</a> published in December 2019 aims to encourage the use of centralised digital services, which will enable the use of digital services within the public administration and guide the adoption of alternative services in order to ensure data security. The policy recommends that all government bodies and agencies should, unless they have specific needs, give priority to the following centralised digital-enabling services provided by the government:</p><ul><li>Cloud services, especially for storing, processing, transmitting or sharing classified information;</li><li>Electronic payment service (government payment gateway);</li><li>Notifications service, and</li><li>Video streaming service.<a id="_Toc1474952"></a></li></ul><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-804.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The NCC organized a National Cybersecurity Conference and started building the Maltese cybersecurity community through the organization of bi-monthly cyber breakfast events, where the cybersecurity community have a chance to discuss the most current cybersecurity issues. The NCC also embarked on a cybersecurity capacity building initiative, organizing a nation-wide cybersecurity skilling programme including courses to train interested IT personnel to launch their careers in cybersecurity and to upskill the existent workforce. This is amplified by awareness-raising initiatives on current cybersecurity challenges and issues. The NCC also manages EU funds directed towards cybersecurity projects and research projects.  </p><p class="subtitle">Security Governance and Operations</p><p>With regards to cybersecurity within the public sector, the MITA drew up, published and communicated <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GMICT_P_0016_Information_Security.pdf">an Information Security Policy</a>. This policy is based on the ISO27001 Information Security International Standard and is applicable to everyone within the public sector. As part of its Security Governance framework, the MITA started scanning all government websites that utilised its infrastructure for the identification of vulnerabilities and subsequent rectification by the respective owners. A Client Protection Framework was developed to provide business owners with visibility on the security position in the areas for which they are responsible. This was an innovative project which re-designed the way the MITA sought to provide assurance to its clients that the infrastructure on which government data resided was adequately safeguarded from the ever-increasing threats defining today’s cyberspace. The MITA heavily invested in cutting-edge technology to provide its clients with the ability to continuously scan for vulnerabilities and obtain real-time visibility on the operational health and security profile of environments hosted on its new Hybrid Cloud Enabling Infrastructure. Information security included three main dimensions: confidentiality, availability and integrity, and involved the application and management of appropriate security measures for a wide range of threats, with the aim of ensuring sustained business success and continuity, and minimising impacts of information security incidents (reference <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/66435.html">ISO/IEC 27000</a>). Additionally, The MITA invested in tools to aid in the detection and prevention of cybersecurity incidents, including adequate training of its employees throughout the organisation, and collaboration with other governmental departments to ensure a centralised and cohesive approach in this domain. Messages to the public pertaining to cybersecurity are channelled through Malta’s cybersecurity <a href="https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/">page</a>.

The second domain relates to information systems where the MITA designs, implements, maintains, and modernises both horizontal digital platforms and solutions, as well as vertical information systems used by the public administration. The third domain focuses on utilising innovative technologies and making the best use of data sharing and linking to facilitate projects such as Once-Only.  A key domain centres around information security, including the operations of a Security Operations Centre and the setting up of a National Coordination Centre. This domain also comprises Cyber Security activities and awareness programmes targeting different audiences.</p><p>The MITA always adopts a strategic approach, therefore this is another domain. The Agency assists the government both at a national and public administration level in drafting and setting up digital policies, strategies, and architectural roadmaps. The MITA represents Malta on various EU and national committees. A sixth domain relates to the external environment. The MITA provides various consultancy and project management services and a suite of digital solutions, which are based on its knowledge, competences, platforms, and tools. The Agency establishes strong relationships with various stakeholders, internal and external to the government. Finally, the strategy presents an internal domain; just like any other organisation, the MITA has several internal supporting functions and processes that are integral to its work. Supporting the seven domains is the most important asset that the organisation has, its employees. The MITA has excellent resources in different areas and takes measures to motivate, develop and recognise them and to provide an environment where they can deliver.<a id="_Toc1474960"></a> The MITA Strategy is being reviewed and strategic objectives analysed so that it sets its pace for the upcoming opportunities and challenges to keep assisting the government in the further digitalisation of public services.   </p><p class="subtitle">Digital Justice Strategy (2022–2027)</p><p>On 3 December 2021, the Maltese Ministry for Justice launched its new <a href="https://digitaljustice.gov.mt">Digital Justice Strategy</a> for the years 2022-2027. The strategy seeks to adopt a strategic framework to make further use of the available technologies, respect the rule of law and the substantive and procedural rights of all citizens. This strategy envisages that a more unified and coordinated approach amongst all justice entities will be achieved by the establishment of a set of guiding fundamental principles, which all digital initiatives within the justice sector shall adhere to. The strategy rests on 3 key strategy enablers, namely people, ICTs and processes for the alignment of strategic priorities in order to reach the strategic vision of ‘Improving the quality and the efficiency of justice through innovation, digitalisation and new technology whilst fully respecting the rule of law and guaranteeing the substantial and procedural rights of all citizens.’ The strategic goals based on Fundamental Justice Principles and strategic principles are: Digital by default; Access to justice; Analytical capabilities; and Building digital skills and competencies.</p><p>The strategy will be implemented in the period of 2022–2027 and will make use of technological building blocks available nationally and at EU level, amongst others. The action plans for the first 2 years have been designed and are being implemented. Considering the evolving nature of ICTs, action plans will be revised to take stock of the digital landscape at the time. Governance structures and the project management approach have also been setup to oversee the strategy implementation process.</p><p>Digital Tourism Roadmap</p><p>The aim of the <a href="https://tourism.gov.mt/en/tourism/Documents/DTR2030.pdf">Digital Strategic Roadmap</a> is to set the course for meeting the goals of one of the 13 strategic challenges of the Malta Tourism Strategy 2021–2030: specifically, the one titled ‘Fostering cross collaboration across various digital tourism initiatives through the consolidation and better use of data’ (page 42). The goals are:</p><ul><li>Consolidate and use quality data to improve access to digital information and valuable knowledge that will advance the local product;</li><li>Invest in new technologies to enhance tourist experience through the offer of more customer centric services;</li><li>Nurture digital cross collaboration initiatives across public, private and non-profit organisations to strengthen the tourism sector and provide a holistic experience to visitors;</li><li>Facilitate the smart use of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, supercomputing, 5G network and augmented / virtual realities amongst others, to increase the value of digital tourism products;</li><li>Incentivise innovation to attain a competitive advantage over slower reacting competing destinations; and</li><li>Facilitate the industry to invest in upskilling its staff to address today’s demands and technologies.</li></ul><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI) </h3><p class="subtitle">Malta.ai Strategy </p><p>The ‘<a href="https://www.mdia.gov.mt/malta-ai-strategy/#:~:text='Strategy and Vision for Artificial,contributions to the global economy.">Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta</a> <a href="https://www.mdia.gov.mt/malta-ai-strategy/#:~:text='Strategy and Vision for Artificial,contributions to the global economy.">2030’</a> is the national AI strategy which was developed by the Maltese government to focus on investment and resources aimed to maximise the benefits which AI can bring to Malta and, more in general, to the global economy. The national AI strategy aims to map the path for Malta to gain a strategic competitive advantage in the global economy as a leader in the AI field through a holistic approach. It also aims to give due focus to the needs of various groups of stakeholders as the country looks forward to achieving its vision. This strategy is built on three strategic pillars which focus on boosting investment, innovation, and adoption. Moreover, the strategy contains three strategic enablers that cut across the three aforementioned areas. Hence, the strategy’s wide-reaching nature ensures that it is inclusive and does not leave any segment of society unduly burdened or left behind. The <a href="https://mdia.gov.mt/">Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA)</a> is entrusted with overseeing the implementation of the strategy.  As part of the strategy, the document titled ‘<a href="https://malta.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Malta_The_Ultimate_AI_Launchpad_vFinal.pdf">the Ultimate artificial AI Launchpad</a>’ sets a vision for Malta to become the “Ultimate AI Launchpad” by 2030.  It contains a total of 72 different AI action points which include six AI-related pilot projects from six key public sectors domains, i.e., tourism, education, customer care, water and energy, health and transport. Such projects facilitate the path for more intake from the private sector. Apart from these six pilot projects, the national AI strategy is funding other initiatives encompassing applied research projects, scholarship funds and educational and awareness campaigns. </p><p class="subtitle">Increasing the Amount of Postgraduates in AI</p><p>The Pathfinder MDIA Digital Scholarship is intended to support postgraduate education – i.e., Master’s (MQF Level 7) and PhD Level (MQF Level 8) – in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Information Security, and to ensure that the Maltese labour market is supplied with the right individuals and to guarantee that it is in a better position to compete at an international level. The scheme is aimed to support those pursuing this path to succeed both at the level of education attainment as well as contributing effectively towards the economy.</p><p class="subtitle">Sustaining Applied Research in AI</p><p>The MDIA has launched an AI Applied Research Grant with the objective to support capacity-building efforts related to Artificial Intelligence research in Malta. Specifically, this Grant aims to encourage:</p><ul><li>Increased capacity for AI-related research in Malta;</li><li>Increased investment in AI-related R&amp;D activities;</li><li>Increased adoption of AI technologies by the public and private sectors; and</li><li>Increased collaboration between academia and commercial entities.</li></ul><h3>Distributed Ledger Technologies </h3><p class="subtitle">Scholarships on Blockchain and DLTs</p><p>On 28 August 2018, a <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/dlt/scholarships">scholarship</a>, forming part of an agreement between the University of Malta and the MITA, was launched in the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation. The scholarship covers a EUR 300,000 fund launched by the government over a three-year period, and which shall enable interested students to pursue their studies in blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). This initiative is seen as a pillar in education to build upon the amount of skilled workforce that will be required to sustain the large number of DLT companies which have shown their interest in investing in Malta and which are willing to base their companies in Malta, following the country’s legislative developments on DLT. During the first two years of the scheme, 19 students have been granted the scholarship. Students granted the scholarship span multiple disciplines including law, business and ICT.</p><h3>Cloud Computing </h3><p>Strategic partnership with Microsoft </p><p>The government of Malta and Microsoft Corporation signed a five-year strategic partnership agreement consisting of a number of key initiatives. One of the main initiatives within the strategic agreement is setting up a Microsoft Innovation Centre in Malta focused on Cloud Computing with a seed investment of over 3 million EUR by Microsoft and its partners. A collaboration agreement was also signed between MITA, MCAST, and Hewlett-Packard (HP) for the establishment of an HP Education Centre at MCAST. The main aim of such agreements between the government, education entities and ICT multinational companies is to stimulate more students to take up a career in ICT. </p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p class="subtitle">Investments in IoT applications</p><p>The Malta.AI Strategy provides direction to expand Malta’s data economy through 5G and IoT. Action 71 of the same strategy states that the government is keen to ensure that investments undertaken in sensor and device infrastructure which can enable IoT applications are fully leveraged and that a number of measures are planned, particularly to:</p><ul><li>Develop a registry which provides information on all government sensor and IoT networks</li><li>Identify where DLTs can add enhancements, including decentralised authentication services and digital trust at scale; and</li><li>Develop and prototype applied DLTs within a sensor and IoT network, assess results and propose a strategy for wider roll-out.</li></ul><h3>High-performance Computing </h3><p class="subtitle">Compute Capacity</p><p>The Malta.AI Strategy also provides direction on the use of cost-effective access to computing capacity and includes a number of actions in this regard (actions 67 to 70).</p><p>The MDIA has secured funding under the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) to establish a European Digital Innovation Hub. One of the primary objectives of this initiative is to offer access to a high-performance computer to start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

In this regard, the government of Malta, through the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/">MITA</a>, has continued to invest heavily in this sector. This was done in order to continue providing the best infrastructure hosting of the government’s public-facing portals. A new <a href="http://www.gov.mt">portal</a> hosting platform was launched in 2019. The new platform is based on Microsoft SharePoint 2016 and aims to offer an out-of-the-box solution to the government for the address of non-standard branded sites. The government of Malta’s <a href="http://www.gov.mt/">portal</a> is an institutional site providing comprehensive and meaningful information on government ministries, policies and services. Government services and information are structured according to the needs of specific citizen groups/events. An A-to-Z list of government websites can be accessed through the portal. In late 2018, the gov.mt website and the sub site doi.gov.mt, were reorganised and relaunched with a new brand. The government of Malta has its official pubic-facing website at <a href="http://www.gov">www.gov</a>.mt. In the past this website used to be a gateway for all the necessary information and links about public administration services. This role has now been taken over by <a href="https://digiplace.sharepoint.com/sites/WE-EUROPEANCOMMISSION-ABCIV-SC442/Shared Documents/D04.01 Digital Public Administration factsheets and infographics/Country factsheets 2021/Malta/Factsheet/servizz.gov.mt">servizz.gov’s</a> website.</p><p class="subtitle">Servizz Website</p><p>Servizz.gov is the agency which acts as the Government’s one-stop-shop for the general public, and <a href="http://www.servizz">www.servizz</a>.gov.mt is now the central website for public administration services. Through this website, the public can look up services categorised by sector. The purpose of establishing such sectors was to simplify the categorisation of services, since now they are linked to a sector which is not bound to change, rather than to a specific ministry which is highly subject to change. The website also offers the possibility for the public to report complaints and excessive bureaucracy, make suggestions and request information. A customer relationship management solution is the infrastructure behind the IT system where all cases are processed against service level agreements and investigated in the most efficient manner. Services that were previously provided on <a href="http://www.mygov">www.mygov</a>.mt now feature on <a href="http://www.servizz.gov.mt">www.servizz.gov.mt</a>. </p><p>The former eForm landing pages were also consolidated within the servizz.gov portal in a homogeneous manner. The servizz.gov portal relies on the eForms platform to load the various services that the public requires. The forms on the eForms platform enable information to be collected once at source and are subsequently electronically distributed to the respective government entities. The eForms platform is also integrated with other electronic services, namely the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/portfolio/information-systems/government-payment-gateway/">Government Payment Gateway (GPG)</a>, electronic identity (eID), SMS notifications and Microsoft Exchange for email notifications.</p><p class="subtitle">Data.gov.mt Website </p><p><a href="https://data.gov.mt/">Data.gov.mt</a> is the National Data Portal. It acts as the main entry point to data discovery and consumption for all official registers. It is designed to be the one-stop-shop for all data discovery and meta-data management matters, thus requiring that all meta-data for all registers be made available through the Register of Registers and other Data Governance registers. It has two main sections, namely (i) the Open Data Portal; and (ii) the Internal Data Sharing services.</p><p>The National Data Portal is also expected to serve as a link with the European Data Portal for harvesting of local datasets, including those related to open data for publication on a European scale. Any data generated through taxpayer’s contribution and classified as Open Data should be made available for re-use by any person or organisation without any barriers or other obstacles, following the 5-star deployment scheme for open data. Indeed, where possible, the portal displays the contents of official registers which are classified as open data. However, when such data are not readily available, a facility within the portal is needed to submit online formal requests. Such requests for open data would need to follow a legally determined process, having various stages of redress in cases of refusal. </p><p>On the other hand, the National Data Portal also caters for the official registers which contain certain sensitive or personal information, and therefore cannot be published as open data. These data are therefore only available to predefined specific roles where the appropriate authentication and authorisation is required in order to gain access. Consequently, the portal also facilitates sharing and re-using such public administration data across authorised entities, as required by their functions. </p><p class="subtitle">Government Intranet for the Public Service</p><p>The MITA offers a <a href="http://intra.gov.mt/">collaborative platform</a> which is also based on Microsoft SharePoint, for document management, collaboration and intranets. This platform is widely used within the government but most notably it is used for the government Intranet for the Public Service – intra.gov.mt. The Intranet for the Public Service is available to all government departments/entities and their employees. Through a collaboration site, intra.gov.mt provides any participating government department/entity the facility to share activities such as document management and workflows that address the internal business requirements of the specific department or entity. The platform holds information in the form of circulars, news, events, directives, newsletters, vacancies, management resources, courses and scholarships and is restricted to public service officials.</p><p class="subtitle">Data Protection Portal</p><p>Apart from the <a href="http://www.dataprotection.gov.mt/">portal</a> of the Information and Data Protection Commissioner, an intra web presence accessible through the <a href="https://intra.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">government intranet</a> came into operation in February 2006, and enabled data protection officers to have access to guidelines and templates to ensure that government processes are compliant with the GDPR. As of May 2018, the Data Protection Unit, now within the <a href="https://justice.gov.mt/en/Pages/justice.aspx">Ministry for Justice</a> (MFJ) revamped this web presence and took the decision to open up this portal to all officers with access to the intranet, so that all guidelines were available to all and not limited to data protection officers.</p><p class="subtitle">Judiciary of Malta Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://justice.gov.mt/en/justice/Pages/The-Judiciary-in-Malta.aspx">portal of the Judiciary of Malta</a> provides the public with extensive information resources on the Maltese judicial system, the judiciary, judges and magistrates, as well as the courts they sit in. It offers a latest news section and an insight on the history of the Maltese judiciary and the important judgements that have been pronounced.</p><p class="subtitle">eCourts Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://ecourts.gov.mt/onlineservices/">eCourts portal</a> is divided into three categories, namely facing the public, citizens and legal practitioners.

The advantage to legal practitioners and citizens is that they can access additional services through their eID that are not available to the general public without having to go physically to the courts. Services that are available to the public include civil cases, judgements, the insolvency register, judicial sales, hall usage, mobile notifications, payment of court fines and court registry fees. Other services that are available to the citizen are: Archive of Acts, My Cases and My Acts and those available to legal practitioners include: online submission of acts, searching of acts, warrants, civil forms and the interdiction and incapacitation register. </p><p class="subtitle">Legislation Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.mt">Legislation Portal</a> is the main portal that makes all Maltese legislation available online, including the consolidated chapters of the laws of Malta, and primary and secondary legislation amongst others.

Through this portal, citizens can control their health records and can give their private physician access to their patient health records. These records include, among other information:  laboratory test results, medical imaging reports, hospital case summaries, Pharmacy of your Choice entitlement, prescription and dispensing records, vaccination records, historical episodes of care, future outpatient/clinic appointments at government hospitals and health centres, and copies of notifiable infectious disease and vaccination forms sent by doctors through myHealth. Through this portal, private physicians are also able to order blood tests and radiology investigations for their patients.</p><p>This portal has been used more and more: by the end of 2022, over 177 000 patients (39% of the population aged 14+) had logged directly into myHealth using their e-ID, and there were 871 physicians accessing the records of over 176 000 different patients. New online services are being made available through myHealth on an on-going basis.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474990"></a>Recruitment Portal</p><p>In 2018 a <a href="https://recruitment.gov.mt/en/page/home">new Recruitment Portal</a>, featuring the Public Service website design, was launched. This new responsive website replaced the previous legacy recruitment portal, which was later decommissioned following an extensive backup process. A mobile app titled Join the Public Service, which is connected to the new recruitment portal, was launched in mid-2018. Its aim was to alert the general public about new job opportunities related to areas of their interest within the public administration. </p><p>Business Portal</p><p>The Business Portal is earmarked to change the current one-stop-shop concept, whereby businesses will get to access multiple services from a single online interface. Thus, all the requirements associated with starting, running and closing a business would be addressed through a single interactive intelligent portal that would automatically and seamlessly submit data to the various stakeholders and deliver services online in a timely manner. </p><p>By following the Once-Only principle, the Portal will ensure that data and information provided to government entities are consistent and accurate and the duplication of data is avoided. In addition, through the use of modern technologies, the portal will enhance user experience whilst utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) practices such as the clustering business behaviour and predictive analytics, identify future business and functional requirements, and request and provide targeted information on the regulatory framework or recommend services and incentives relevant to the particular end-user.</p><h3>Subnational Platforms and Applications</h3><p class="subtitle">Local Government Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.localgovernment.gov.mt">Local Government Portal</a> aims to provide holistic information about the local government in Malta. With a view to empower the role of local councils and assist citizens in easily accessing council services, a dedicated <a href="http://www.mylocality.gov.mt">sub-portal</a> provides information specific to individual local councils and regional committees. The main objectives for the creation of this web portal were to encourage local councils to effectively interact with the community in general and to provide international users with a valuable tool, allowing them to better understand the geo-cultural composition of the Maltese Islands and the relevant specificities. The portal also promotes the advantages of standardisation, opening the channels of locality-based prioritisation and differentiation.</p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk507071848"></a>Next Generation Access</p><p>Malta is the European leader in Next Generation Access (NGA) broadband access as confirmed in European DESI reports. The Malta Communications Authority plays an important role in facilitating and nurturing a healthy and competitive business environment and infrastructure-based competition.</p><p class="subtitle">MAGNET</p><p>MAGNET was implemented in 1995 as the Malta Government NETwork that connects all government ministries, departments and agencies, as well as local councils, police stations, libraries, hospitals, health centres, social services offices and embassies. This network enabled the government to disseminate IT and information society applications such as email, the internet, and corporate applications like the Common Database (CdB) and the Departmental Accounting System (DAS) to help facilitate and improve the efficiency of the public service. The availability of this network enabled the government to launch its eGovernment services. A new network, “MAGNET II”, was launched in July 2005 and partly replaced MAGNET. This new state‑of-the-art network presented a number of benefits for users compared to its predecessor. In particular, MAGNET II provided enhanced bandwidth per site, offered better reliability through strict service level agreements (SLAs), guaranteed 99.8% minimum site availability and was fully secure through extensive encryption.</p><p>In 2015, MAGNET III was launched to provide cost-effective connectivity services to the government. By the end of 2016, all MAGNET II sites migrated to the MAGNET III infrastructure. Whilst retaining the strong features of MAGNET II, the MAGNET III infrastructure offered flexible bandwidth in accordance with client business needs. Another major benefit of MAGNET III was the network’s ability to enable video calls efficiently and effectively between all connected organisations. A government-wide intranet became available to all entities connected to the network. The Malta Public Service Intranet allowed document exchange and sharing across ministries and departments. By the end of 2020 around 250 sites were connected to MAGNET through this fibre-based network, with an additional 400 sites ca. connected to the broadband-based portion of this network. By 2023, the number of sites having fibre connectivity increased to 400. </p><p class="subtitle">Government Core Network Upgrade</p><p>The <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/">MITA</a> core network infrastructure located at the MITA’s two Data Centres and interlinking them together, is the junction through which all network traffic originating from any government site is transported through MAGNET, to its intended recipient. The core network infrastructure is a fundamental building block on which the MITA can provide a wide variety of government services, thanks to its robustness, high availability, high speed, high capacity and security measures.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><p>Malta uses the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/testa_en">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA)</a> network as the main cross border infrastructure to communicate digitally among EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Maltese Government Common Database</p><p>The Maltese Government Common Database (CdB) was enhanced with some minor amendments.

The MeliCERTes platform provides an information sharing opportunity for operational cooperation among CSIRTs. Local stakeholders provided action points aimed to:</p><ul><li>Establish a direct access point between CSIRTMalta and MeliCERTes. The other beneficiaries – MT-CSIRT – will share information through CSIRTMalta via a central MISP instance and other MISP instances hosted for different constituents at CSIRTMalta;</li><li>Increase the preparedness of CSIRTMalta, MT-CSIRT and other CSIRTs for the requirements and tasks arising from the NIS Directive, including training of beneficiaries’ personnel; and</li><li>Provide review reports to the EU Commission to improve MeliCERTes functionality and security features. </li></ul><p>These actions remain in line with Malta’s second National Cybersecurity Strategy 2023‒2026. </p><p class="subtitle">Data Exchange between Critical and Relevant Entities in Malta</p><p>Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) and Digital Service Providers (DSPs) within Malta are required to implement security measures in line with the direction provided by the NIS National Competent Authority, namely the CIIP unit, within the MaltaCIP Directorate, MHSR. To facilitate collaboration between the different stakeholders, CSIRTMalta introduced several innovative tools including MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) as Data Exchange Mechanisms for OSPs and DSPs, as well as CIs and CIIs to exchange information online in real-time and in automated format. As a result, stakeholders are now in a better position to share information about cyber incidents and threats more effectively. </p><p class="subtitle">Notifications Service </p><p>As part of the eGovernment strategy to enhance citizen communication, the government of Malta invested in an eGovernment Shared Service (eGSS), the Notifications Service, to enable a one-way communication channel from government to citizens and businesses. The Notifications Service provides a gateway for messaging both by SMS and emails, allowing citizens and businesses to be notified of various government services instantly.</p><p>Public entities and Ministries may send notifications to those citizens and businesses that make use of their services either directly, through a purposely built web-based portal, or by integrating their systems to the Notifications Service via APIs. Messages can be sent either individually or in bulk, using SMS or email as delivery channels.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">eIDAS Node</p><p>In 2018, Malta was one of only four Member States that successfully met the regulatory deadline for the recognition of other Member States’ eID schemes under the eIDAS Regulation. As the operator of Malta’s eIDAS Node, the MITA was successfully certified following a TickITplus ISO9001 and ISO27001 audit, and the node was set in full production mode in July. The German middleware was successfully integrated in the environment in September, enabling the mandatory recognition of the notified German electronic identity scheme. This placed Malta as one of the top-running Member States in the adoption of the eIDAS Regulation and facilitated the early development of cross-border services. In 2019, Malta succeeded in integrating with its eIDAS Node Infrastructure all those notified Member States for which the deadline for recognition by Malta was October 2019, namely Belgium, Luxembourg, Estonia, Croatia, Spain and Portugal. In 2020, Malta actively participated in the working groups set up to define the technical specifications of the Once-Only exchange mechanism to be implemented for the Single Digital Gateway Regulation. In 2022, the eIDAS Node infrastructure has been completed by attaching the national electronic identity card to the eIDAS Node. This allows Maltese citizens and residents to use their electronic identity or residence permit card to access eGovernment services in other Member States, and the services offered by the European Commission through its authentication portal. MITA has now shifted gears in the implementation of the Once-only Technical System for the Single Digital Gateway Regulation. This will build upon the eIDAS Node infrastructure to additionally provide for the authenticity of data that is exchanged across borders for the fulfilment of online procedures.</p><p class="subtitle">National Identity Management System </p><p>The existing <a href="https://identitymalta.com/id-cards/">National Identity Management System (NIDMS)</a> aims to support <strong>core identity management</strong> <strong>processes,</strong> including the issuance of electronic identity cards (eID Card), ePassports, and residence documents. The government operates a number of identity management systems, the most important of which are: core database systems, electronic identity (eID) infrastructure, an electoral system, a national identity card system and the passport system. However, it should be noted that these and other disparate information systems are not entirely interoperable.</p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-834.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" />Electronic Identity</p><p>In 2019, an optional two-factor authentication mechanism for eID based on a time-based one-time password (TOTP) mechanism was introduced, intended for specific eGovernment services which require a substantial level of assurance. Support for the OpenID Connect Protocol to facilitate better access from native mobile applications was also introduced. </p><p>In 2020, Identity Malta, together with MITA, upgraded the eID Account Management functionality to further align eID with the GDPR and to provide users with additional visibility and control over their eID account. The new Account Management screen includes an updated user profile with activity tracking and an overhauled help facility. It allows users to change their password, email address and mobile number, including the corresponding verification. The two-factor authentication consists in identifying citizens using either their email address, a mobile phone number or an app, to which the TOTP will be sent. As an increased security measure, the two-factor authentication will be enforced in a mandatory manner.  It is currently being enforced for all eID users, in a gradual manner, depending on the age group. </p><p>The achievements reached and the on-going work on the eID system mean that the government has a stable and reliable platform for electronic authentication to enable eGovernment services at a local level, with different levels of assurance, providing the required choice between usability and security. Future initiatives will include notifying the Malta eID scheme/s, under the eIDAS Regulation, to facilitate cross-border authentication with other Member States.</p><p>In 2022, Malta successfully migrated the eID system to the Cloud. This will ensure the performance, reliability and resilience of the platform as we prepare to meet the demands for eGovernment take-up for the coming 5 years, and it will facilitate the use of the eID Card for authentication in the cross-border services that will be established via the Single Digital Gateway.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identity Cards (eID Card)</p><p>The eID Card is an identity card which, in addition to the traditional identification features, also includes an electronic component which allows citizens to access an array of electronic services provided by the government and other third parties.</p><p>Maltese nationals who are 14 years of age and older are entitled to an eID Card. The card’s electronic features are available to all card holders with one exception: the signature certificate is only available to citizens aged 18 years and older.</p><p>Residents who are not Maltese nationals, yet who are eligible for a residence document or a residence permit, will have, through electronic documents, the same eID features as the eID Card. Specifically, EU nationals, spouses of EU nationals and regular third country nationals residing in Malta have the same eID features and accesses as Maltese nationals.</p><p>The electronic chip of the eID card holds the same biographic data that are visible on the face of the card, including a digital image of the citizen. The chip includes two digital certificates for authentication and signatures, and applications for ticketing and electronic purse.</p><p>The digital certificate for authentication enables the citizen to log in securely to eGovernment services. The digital certificate for signatures is an enabler for electronic signatures. These are qualified certificates under the eCommerce Act and the electronic signature will be equivalent to a hand-written signature. Both certificates are protected by different Personal Identification Numbers (PINs).</p><p>The eID Card can be used by citizens to securely access several governmental services which are integrated into the eID platform. eID cards are issued in full conformity with applicable legislation at the EU level. </p><p class="subtitle">ePassports</p><p>Passports issued as from the 1 October 2008 are all ePassports. These first generations of electronic passports had a BAC (Basic Access Control) chip. The biometrics captured were a photo image and a signature. As from 1 July 2010, the ePassports’ chip was upgraded to EAC (Extended Access Control). Fingerprints were added to the biometrics captured.</p><p>On 30 March 2015, the ePassports’ chip was upgraded to SAC (Supplemental Access Control). However, the same biometrics were captured as the chip is the latest third generation to date.</p><p>The main reasons that led to the introduction of an ePassport were to:</p><ul><li>Prevent fight passport fraud;</li><li>Reduce passport forgery;</li><li>Facilitate more robust border controls; and</li><li>Establish a link with the lawful owner.</li></ul><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Public Procurement System Platform</p><p>The <a href="https://www.etenders.gov.mt/epps/home.do">eProcurement Solution</a> developed by the government of Malta is the Electronic Public Procurement System (ePPS) platform, which is supplied by European Dynamics S.A. The platform was launched in July 2011 to facilitate the Maltese government’s transition to online procurement, covering the full life cycle of public procurement. The solution consisted in an eProcurement platform that comprised a core and a number of eProcurement-specific services, offering several parameterisation capabilities for meeting the exact needs of a purchasing authority. </p><p>The Electronic Public Procurement System covers the whole procurement procedure, starting from the notification of a procurement call at publication stage, through to the evaluation process, right up to the recommendation and acceptance of award stage. It also stretches to the post-contract stage, wherein contract implementation information may be recorded. </p><p>The eProcurement solution enables actual tender bids to be submitted securely online because it utilises an end-to-end encryption system. The ePPS accommodates all procurement procedures including the most common procedures, such as the open procedure and framework agreements, as well as other more specific procedures, such as the negotiated procedure, the competitive dialogue, the restricted procedure and concessions. The system also caters for new and unique aggregation tools such as eAuctions and the Dynamic Purchasing System. The system may be used for all thresholds and award mechanisms, namely: the lowest price, cost or best price-quality ratio. The government’s e-procurement platform is currently mostly used by the Department of Contracts (Malta’s Central Government Authority) through its Operations Directorate and its Sectoral Procurement Directorate, when publishing and administering procurement calls on behalf of Contracting Authorities across Ministries, departments and entities. In addition, the ePPS is also used by contracting authorities themselves, as long as they form part of the public administration.</p><p class="subtitle">Department of Contracts Portal</p><p>Since the launch of the <a href="https://www.etenders.gov.mt/epps/home.do">eProcurement platform for Malta</a>, the <a href="http://contracts.gov.mt/en/Pages/Home-DepartmentOfContracts.aspx">Department of Contracts Portal</a> has taken a different role. Rather than being an interactive site for economic operators to learn about and participate in tender opportunities, for the past years it has started serving as a window for public procurement information. In fact, it houses an array of documents, such as the procurement regulations and procurement policies across the government. Essentially, all public procurement regulations (including the classic, utilities, concessions, emergency and property ones), contracts circulars and procurement policy notes (PPNs) are publicly available. In addition, there are also other resources and information, such as: EU procurement publications, fact sheets, common procurement vocabulary (CPV), the Single Digital Gateway Information Resources (SDG), monthly awards, General Contracts Committee’s (GCC) recommendations, and the annual reports on their workings. Furthermore, there are also links to ec.europa.eu, eCertis and Freedom of Information. </p><p>The Department’s Portal also offers a search facility for tenders published between October 2008 and December 2013. </p><p class="subtitle">MITA Procurement Website</p><p>The MITA, the other Central Purchasing Body besides the DoC, maintains a <a href="mailto:https://procurement.mita.gov.mt/">procurement-dedicated website</a> that allows greater interaction on its public calls for tenders (issued on the ePPS Platform) through a mobile responsive design. The website also provides an outlook forecast on upcoming calls for tenders scheduled to be issued by the agency, and provides procurement-related resources, including those related to the dynamic purchasing systems established by the agency.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a><img src="img/32-837.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Between 2017 and 2020, the deployment of these services was supported by CEF funding for the implementation of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/2015-mt-ia-0060">eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure</a> (eHDSI) generic services. CEF funds helped Malta set up the necessary infrastructure for structured exchange of health data between Malta and other EU Member States by means of interoperable cross-border eHealth services. Malta forms part of the secure peer-to-peer eHDSI network, through which patient summaries can be exchanged between EU Member States. These services were thoroughly tested and audited before going live in 2019.</p><p>The systems developed during the implementation of these services are connected to the national eHealth infrastructure. Since December 2019, Malta has offered live services for the exchange of patient summaries through its National Contact Point for eHealth (NCPeH) in the Ministry for Health; the first services deployed have been with other ‘first wave’ countries, i.e., Luxembourg, Portugal, and Croatia. Malta has now completed a second follow-up compliance check in 2022 and expanded the service further to include Spain and Netherlands. The NCPeH has also applied for EU4Health funds to start the exchange of ePrescription and eDispensation records. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base Registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Contracts Register</p><p>The Maltese government has embarked on the implementation of a Contracts Register based on the <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/">World Bank’s Open Contracting Data Standard</a> and has now also fully implemented the electronic integration of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/e-procurement/espd_en">European Single Procurement Document</a> (ESPD) and integration with <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/tools/ecertis/#/homePage">eCERTIS</a> and National Registers. The first is a significant statement on transparency, whereas the second continues to automate processes and enshrines the Once-Only principle. </p><p class="subtitle">Person Register</p><p>A Legal Notice for the implementation of a Person Register has been enacted. Once in effect, it shall provide measures to facilitate sharing and re-using personal data between public sector bodies and enable the link between the core person details record and other records held in other official registers containing equivalent personal data in relation to the same person. The implementation of this base register also aims to enable the Once-Only principle within government. In addition to modernising the existing solutions, improving user experience, harmonising the approach for system-to-system integration, eliminating dependency on legacy systems and taking advantage of the benefits brought by with the introduction of new technology, another objective of the Person Register is to extend the scope of the existing functionalities. These include accepting personal details updates from different life events across government as detailed within the Legal Notice. The implementation of the Person Register started in 2022, it is well under way and we expect to go live with the first phase in 2024. </p><p class="subtitle">Business Register</p><p>The Business Register project is currently undergoing the final testing phase by both internal users from MBR and external users such as practitioners and CSPs. The planned go-live is Q3 2023.</p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Applied Research </p><p>The MITA has set up a new applied research function with the purpose of using existing knowledge and technologies in an innovative way to address business problems within the MITA or public administration. These initiatives will be used as a vehicle to develop proof of concepts and promote the further take-up of emerging technologies. Where applicable, the MITA will make resources available through the Emerging Technologies Lab to provide projects with the necessary backing. The aim is to increase the use of technology for the benefit of citizens and businesses. Since the technology would not have been applied in such a way before, developing the proof of concept will be the first step to take the project forward for actual implementation. The knowledge gained will be used as input for the justification of the project or the adoption of alternative methods. Independent from the decision on whether to proceed with project implementation, the knowledge gained by the MITA, public administration, and partners can be used to solve other similar problems. In addition, investments in such an initiative will strengthen and increase the research and innovation aspects of the Country.</p><p class="subtitle">Launch of the Emerging Technologies Lab</p><p>Following the launch of the MITA <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/portfolio/engagement-with-community-bringing-digital/emerging-technologies-lab/">Emerging Technologies Lab</a> in October 2018, with an investment of EUR 250 000, the lab has provided an opportunity to explore and learn emerging technologies. With the purpose of promoting the various technologies available at the lab and increasing the knowledge on these technologies, during the first two years of operations more than 50 events have been organised at the lab. In 2020 most of these events have taken place online. MITA employees, government employees, students, as well as private sector start-ups have the opportunity to develop their ideas in areas such as virtual and augmented realities, robotics and IoT through the use of 3D printing and microcontrollers, AI and distributed ledger technologies. </p><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p><img src="img/32-843.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

A public call was then launched requesting proposals for the implementation of these projects and systems. For the most part, the work involves: (i) digitalising official documents on industrial property rights, including trademarks and patents; (ii) digital labelling and documenting the process of product manufacturing in Gozo, and  (iii) bolstering the security of sensitive documents found within the Planning Authority’s existing blockchain system. Progress is ongoing on these initiatives. </p><h3>Big Data </h3><p>European Digital Innovation Hub</p><p>The Data Science Research Platform (DSRP) at the University of Malta was formed in May 2018 to conduct research in the interdisciplinary field of data science. The scope is to use signal processing, machine learning and statistics to develop innovative techniques and to extract useful knowledge from various data sources in an effective manner, to the benefit of wider public. </p><p>The MDIA has secured funding under the Digital Europe Programme (DEP) to establish a European Digital Innovation Hub. One of the primary objectives of this initiative is to offer access to start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to a high-performance computer, which will facilitate the analysis of big data. The EDIH is scheduled to become operational within the next three years and is poised to significantly enhance technology access and adoption for these businesses. </p><h3>Cloud Computing</h3><p class="subtitle">Hybrid Cloud Platform (HCP)</p><p>The MITA operates a <a href="https://cloud.gov.mt/overview/">Hybrid Cloud Platform (HCP)</a>, a hosting solution entirely developed and maintained in Malta for all government entities. It is based upon an on-premises stack, which is hosted within the MITA Tier3 datacentre for Malta-based operations, and an off-premises cloud linked with Cloud Service Provider’s data centres within the EU. The two parts of the hybrid cloud are connected to provide a single enterprise environment, therefore allowing services offered from the on-premise cloud to integrate with public cloud services (and vice-versa), and be scalable across clouds. The HCP is also connected to the secure and high-speed Malta Government Network, allowing integration with other government systems hosted on traditional virtual hosting platforms.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>GovTech</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><p><img src="img/32-849.png" alt="32-849.png" /></p><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p><h1><a id="_Toc140675556"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on Malta’s responsible bodies for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-malta">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2>National </h2><p class="subtitle">Office of the Prime Minister</p><p>eGovernment in Malta forms part of the remit of the <a href="https://opm.gov.mt/mt/Pages/OPM.aspx">Office of the Prime Minister</a>.
