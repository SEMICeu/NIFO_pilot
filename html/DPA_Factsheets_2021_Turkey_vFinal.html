The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-403.png" alt="35-403.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main components (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Turkey in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-406.jpeg" alt="35-406.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Turkey’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF principles, despite the lack of data for the Principle 4 (Reusability). Turkey scores above the European average for the Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) with a maximal score of 4 and meets the European average for every other principle. The mid-upper performance for the Principle 9 (Multilingualism) indicates an area of improvement for Turkish public administrations that could better their use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service. More specifically, the number of language resources and the extent to which business regular operations’ mobility is possible could be improved.</p><p><img src="img/35-409.jpeg" alt="35-409.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Turkish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show a very good performance with maximal scores of 4 for every interoperability layer. Despite the score of 4 obtained for the implementation of interoperability governance, Turkish public administrations could improve the implementation of the Recommendation 23 specifically, which independently gets a lower score of 1, by enhancing their consultation of relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level, in accordance with their National Interoperability Frameworks (NIFs), when procuring and developing ICT solutions.</p><p><img src="img/35-411.jpeg" alt="35-411.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Turkey’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of all recommendations, despite the lack of data in the areas related to open data and security and privacy. In line with the European average, Turkey gets a maximal score of 4 for base registries and internal information sources and services and for the conceptual model itself, as well as for external information sources and services, scoring above the European average in this area. For catalogues, Turkey obtains an upper middle score of 3. In order to reach a higher performance in catalogues, a potential area of improvement could be to enhance the implementation of Recommendation 44, on the provision of catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions and the use of common models for describing them.</p><p>Additional information on Turkey’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2><a id="_Hlk30431126"></a>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity</strong>: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong>: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services</strong>: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers</strong>: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The Strategy was prepared with a participatory approach. A comprehensive work was carried out with the contributions of many stakeholders such as public institutions, academia, professional organizations, private sector, NGOs and international organizations.</p><p>Having the vision "creating value on a global scale with an agile and sustainable AI ecosystem for a prosperous Turkey", the Strategy was designed around 6 strategic priorities. To that end, the National AI Strategy draws up the Turkish roadmap in the field of AI technologies and includes the steps to be taken in critical technological areas. It presents the measures that will place works in the field to be carried out nationally on common ground and the governance mechanism determined to implement these measures. Over time, the measures will adapt to uncertainties by evaluating Turkey’s changing strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats. </p><p>Within the National AI Strategy and initiatives in the field, Turkey identified six pillars transforming the society and the economy around human, data and platform conditions. In this context, Turkey needs to have high‑quality data respecting ethical principles. Hence, the initial focus is to enable trustworthy data access nationwide, then expanding to international cooperation. To that end, the OECD AI Recommendations, the European Council and Commissions’ efforts on AI ethics, the work of existing bodies active in the field, e.g. the European Commission Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI), and the efforts of UNESCO on AI ethics and principles are highly acknowledged in the draft strategy.</p><p>The draft AI strategy sets the measures that will be implemented between 2021 and 2025. The strategy’s basic approach is to create an AI ecosystem that tries, discovers, learns and constantly updates itself. Aligned with the <a href="mailto:https://www.sbb.gov.tr/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Eleventh_Development_Plan-2019-2023.pdf">Eleventh Development Plan</a> and the Decrees of the Science, Technology and Innovation Policies Board, the strategy is designed around the following priorities:</p><ul><li>Training AI experts and increasing their employability;</li><li>Supporting research, entrepreneurship and innovation;</li><li>Facilitating the possibilities of access to quality data and technical infrastructure;</li><li>Promoting regulation and awareness to accelerate socioeconomic adaptation;</li><li>Strengthening international cooperation; and</li><li>Accelerating structural and labour transformation.</li></ul><p>Within the scope of these strategic priorities, 24 objectives and 119 measures were determined.</p><p>The implementation process of the Strategy will be coordinated by the "Steering Committee", which will be chaired by the Vice President. The governance mechanism embraces AI Ecosystem Advisory Group and working groups as well, where all relevant stakeholders will be represented. </p><p>Action plans, in which the implementation details of the Strategy will be laid out, will be prepared by the relevant Ministries under the coordination of the Steering Committee.</p><p>The rapidly transforming nature of the AI field necessitates a dynamic implementation process for the Strategy.

The portal provides citizens and enterprises with a single point of access to eGovernment services and also serves a third group of users, i.e. public sector agencies themselves, allowing them to interact with each other and exchange information. The contractor for the eGovernment Gateway is a governmental company called <a href="https://www.turksat.com.tr/en">Turksat</a>, Turkey’s main provider of satellite services and one of the biggest providers of IT infrastructure services. </p><p>The Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency, in line with its mission, works in great cooperation with public institutions, local governments and the private sector in order to offer more services with high added value, and more qualified and integrated services via the Digital Turkey Platform (eGovernment Gateway). In particular, the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency continues to work not only to transfer services to the electronic environment, but also to change the service concept offered. In this context, the 12<sup>th</sup> meeting regarding ‘Digital Turkey and Mitigation of Bureaucracy,’ under the chairmanship of the Vice President and the coordination of the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency, was held in March 2021. All ministries, professional organisations that qualify as public institutions and the business world are invited to these meetings and the decisions made at the end of the meetings are followed by the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency. </p><p>After the establishment of this body, inter‑institutional coordination was maintained at the highest level and a high momentum was achieved for eGovernment efforts. For example, by 31 July 2018 the number of institutions integrated into the eGovernment Gateway was 460, the number of services provided 3 370 and the number of eGovernment users 38 711 601; but as of 14 April 2021, the number of integrated institutions was 791, the number of services provided 5 749 and the number of users 54 213 270. </p><p>In addition, while at the end of 2019 the number of accesses to the eGovernment Gateway was 1 179 624 439, at the end of 2020 it totalled 2 305 790 643. The main reason for this considerable increase was the rise in the burden on the eGovernment Gateway during the pandemic period, as many important services were transferred to the digital environment in order to provide public services 24/7 without interruption. </p><p>Especially during the COVID-19 outbreak, coordination was ensured by the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency for the transfer of the most needed public services to the eGovernment Gateway in order to provide continuity of the following services:</p><ul><li>pandemic social support pre-application;</li><li>restructuring of social security debts;</li><li>Life Fits Home Code generation and request;</li><li>COVID-19 vaccination status inquiry and appointment;</li><li>travel permit application; and</li><li>loss of income, rental and turnover support applications for enterprises.</li></ul><p>Efforts to improve the benefits from the eGovernment Gateway for disadvantaged citizens were continued during the pandemic period and eGovernment Gateway access passwords started to be delivered to citizens over the age of 65 to their residential address. In this way, it was ensured that the individuals in question were able to benefit from many digital services, as well as get their appointments for the COVID‑19 vaccine through the eGovernment Gateway, like many other citizens. In addition, the access page can be transformed into a format allowing disabled citizens to make transactions.</p><p>To ensure accessibility and user-friendliness, the eGovernment Gateway is also accessible through the barrier-free eGovernment Gateway call centre. The call centre, specifically designed for disabled people, started to operate for eGovernment-related requests in 2018. As a result, the accessibility of the eGovernment Gateway was accredited according to the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/37031.html">ISO 9241-151</a> and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/58625.html">ISO/IEC 40500</a> standards. </p><p>As a result of all the above-mentioned efforts, several eServices are now accessible to users through the eGovernment Gateway:</p><ul><li>mobile eGovernment; </li><li>Public Apps Centre; </li><li>Single Sign On (SSO) service; </li><li>MERSIS; </li><li>natural gas subscription application/query/subscription agreement termination application; </li><li>electricity subscription application/query/subscription agreement termination application; </li><li>mobile line application; </li><li>eContract termination service; and </li><li>subscription and debt query service. </li></ul><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk77768912"></a>National Judiciary Informatics System </p><p>The <a href="http://www.e-justice.gov.tr/">National Judiciary Informatics System (UYAP)</a> is an eJustice system designed to ensure a fast, reliable and accurate judicial system.

It was opened for use on 18 May 2015.The system includes 34 modules with business intelligence and prioritizing information security, such as the Residence Permit, International Protection, Temporary Protection, Statelessness, Entry Ban, Deportation and Irregular Migration modules. GöçNet continues to be developed in a controlled manner in line with current needs. Services are offered via e-government. Temporary Protection Personal Information Inquiry, Residence Permit Personal Information Inquiry, International Protection Personal Information Inquiry, Stateless Person Personal Information Inquiry are the services offered for the purpose of checking the personal information of the foreigner in order to create an e-government membership.</p><p>GöçNet Fingerprint </p><p>The national GöçNet Fingerprint system is integrated with GöçNet, the corporate software of the General Directorate of Migration Management. It can query approximately 5 390 000 fingerprint records in the database with 1-N query logic and has a data capacity of 10 000 000 records. The system is currently used by foreigners in 81 Provincial Directorates of Migration Management for identification purposes.</p><p>With the GöçNet Fingerprint Application Notification Obligation Module, the notification obligation transactions of foreigners which are fulfilled with wet signature have started to be implemented digitally.</p><p>eResidence </p><p>The <a href="https://e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr/">eResidence</a> system was established by the General Directorate of Migration Management in order to carry out the residence permit procedures more quickly and effectively. With this system, foreigners who want to apply for a residence permit can do so online at e-ikamet.goc.gov.tr. Then, the appointment date and time are sent to them via SMS or e-mail. Thus, a lot of information requested from foreigners is obtained during the application, preventing bureaucracy and workload. In addition, foreigners will come to the Provincial Directorates of Migration Management on the most appropriate appointment date, preventing the crowd that may sometimes be formed in the directorates. With the latest update, the application status and residence permit card printing inquiry processes can also be carried out by foreigners through the eResidence system.</p><p>In addition, technical integration has been achieved with many public institutions in order to provide the information and documents needed for residence permit procedures and minimize the documents required from foreigners. Such institutions include the General Directorate of Population and Citizenship Affairs (NVIGM), the General Directorate of Security, the Insurance Information and Monitoring Centre, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ), the Ministry of Labor and Social Security (MoLSS), the Ministry of National Education (MEB), the General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre (TKGM), the Notaries Union of Turkey, the Presidency for Turks Abroad and Related Communities (YTB)and -Turkish Board of Higher Education (YOK). As a result of integration with the Revenue Administration, for instance, the residence permit book value and fees can be paid online. Thanks to this service, many foreigners who do not want to go to banks or finance cashiers during the pandemic have been able to make their payments electronically.</p><p>The system, which was offered to foreigners under temporary protection in 2017, has been opened to the use of foreigners with international protection application and status as of 19 June 2020.</p><p>ID Notification System </p><p>The ID Notification System enables operators in accommodation complexes, who are the users of the system, to instantly send the ID information of guests and employees to the Turkish National Police.</p><p>Appointment System </p><p>An Appointment System (<em>Nüfus ve Vatandaşlık Işleri Genel Müdürlüğü Randevu Sistemi</em>) was developed in order to provide the services of the Directorate General of Civil Registration and Citizenship (DGCRC) via appointments with a view to saving time and preventing congestion in the Civil Registry Directorates. The system was developed and is maintained by the Software Division under the DGCRC’s Information Technologies Department. An average of 300 000 appointments are made per day via the Appointment System.</p><p>NviNet </p><p>Applications belonging to many different software companies and developed on different platforms were used within the DGCRC. These applications were gathered under a single roof, the NviNet platform, which was developed according to the demands of users with up-to-date software languages. Applications that could only be used by a small part of the personnel in the DGCRC are now available to all personnel in the provincial and general directorates.</p><p>New Civil Registration and Citizenship Mobile Application</p><p>A New Civil Registration and Citizenship Mobile Application was developed by the DGCRC’s Software Division to serve citizens. It contains the necessary information to communicate with the Civil Registration Directorates and Offices (demands, appointments, inquiries, etc.).</p><p>Women Support App</p><p>The Women Support App (KADES) was created by the Turkish National Police in order to prevent criminal actions such as the violence and abuse to which women and children are exposed. It allows a one-click access of the citizens to the 155 police emergency line in case of emergency. Then, the nearest team and patrol are deployed to the crime scene. </p><h3>Subnational Portals</h3><p class="subtitle">eMunicipality </p><p>The <a href="https://www.belediye.gov.tr/">eMunicipality Information System</a> started being implemented by the Ministry of Interior and is now being developed jointly with the Ministry of Environment and Urbanisation. After a pilot phase in 2017, the <a href="https://www.belediye.gov.tr/">eMunicipality Information System</a> started being extensively used in 2019. The system is currently used by 658 municipalities out of 1 397 and work is underway to cover all municipalities.</p><p>The system is an application ensuring fast, reliable and uninterrupted provision of municipal services to citizens, following a service-oriented local government policy. Besides, the application aims to disseminate in all municipalities the City Information System, which is one of the leading smart city applications and also follows a service‑oriented local government policy. </p><p>The eMunicipality Information System is composed of 67 modules, including the Electronic Document Management System, Movables/Immovables, Performance-Based Budget, Analytical Accounting, and modules for infrastructure and superstructure. 45 modules were developed by the Ministry of Interior and 22 by the Ministry of Environment and Urbanisation.

According to Decision of the Council of Cybersecurity No. 2012/1, dated 20 December 2012, the General Directorate of Communications (under the <a href="https://www.uab.gov.tr/">Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure</a>) is responsible for the implementation of the network. In 2018, public agencies began to provide the data necessary for their services to the eGovernment Gateway through PublicNET, thereby enhancing the national cybersecurity. The number of public agencies connecting to PublicNET reached 140 at of the end of 2020.</p><p class="subtitle">eGovernment Gateway software and hardware</p><p>The maximum level of security in the domestic eGovernment Gateway was achieved with the installation of software and hardware enabling Turkish citizens to utilise electronic public services securely. In particular, the eGovernment Gateway network equipment was renewed in September 2018. Thanks to the renewed devices, the network capacity of the eGovernment Gateway increased by approximately ten times, the number of processors and disks on the system by approximately two, and the RAM of the servers by 3.5. That way, the increasing demand has been met smoothly and the eGovernment Gateway continues to provide services to over 45 million registered citizens without any problem.</p><p class="subtitle">eTax </p><p>The <a href="https://en.hmb.gov.tr/">Ministry of Treasury and Finance</a> implemented a nationwide communications network to streamline administrative workflows and allow citizens to submit their tax returns online. The system connects tax offices, regional finance offices and tax inspector offices of the Revenue Administration. Citizens can submit tax returns via the internet and call up their tax file online whenever they want. All tax data is centrally stored in a data warehouse system, and access to the system is secured by the use of digital signatures and encrypted data transfer via a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).</p><p>Health Informatics Network</p><p>The <a href="https://sba.saglik.gov.tr/">Health Informatics Network (SBA)</a> is a private health network established throughout the country to enable institutions and organisations in the health sector to use their resources and health-related data jointly, and communicate data through a reliable and fast channel.

Nearly 3 000 units have been integrated into this structure with MPLS VPN (Virtual Private Network) technology under the Health Informatics Network Project (SBA).</p><p>R&amp;D and Design Centres and Technology Development Zones Web Portal</p><p>The Technology Development Zones, establishing strong linkages between the private sector and the research community, started to be implemented in 2001. The Law on the Technology Development Zones fosters the establishment of such zones in higher education institutes and/or research centres to enhance knowledge circulation. As of today, all work and transactions related to the application, establishment and activities of Technology Development Zones are carried out on teknopark.sanayi.gov.tr. Similarly, the application and activity evaluation processes of private sector R&amp;D and Design Centres are carried out on the agtm.sanayi.gov.tr digital platform.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Integrated Public Service Platform </p><p>The eGovernment Gateway enables public institutions to share data via a secure infrastructure (VPN). That way, an institution requiring data from other institutions benefits from a secure and single connection to the eGovernment Gateway, without having to connect with each institution one by one. The eGovernment Gateway consists of a <a href="https://kamu.turkiye.gov.tr/">web-based application</a> and a service-based application. The web-based application, working on the <a href="https://kamu.turkiye.gov.tr/">Public</a> Application Centre, provides a mechanism enabling civil servants to see only the information permitted within the authorisation given by the related public institution. With the service-based application, institutions can share data with each other without requiring any authorisation within specified rules. For example, by using the Public Service Platform (PSP, <em>Kamu Uygulamaları Merkezi</em>), universities can check the military service status (information provided by Ministry of Defence) of the students online by utilising the national ID numbers of the students.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">Identity Information Sharing System</p><p>The <a href="https://kpsbasvuru.nvi.gov.tr/">Identity Information Sharing System (KPS)</a> went into operation in 2005 as an extension of the Central Population Management System (MERNIS). Public institutions and agencies can access ID information stored in the MERNIS database via the KPS under the conditions strictly specified in the respective access protocols. In order for agencies to benefit from the KPS, an agreement must first be concluded with the General Directorate of Civil Registration and Nationality. The KPS works over a VPN and every user is assigned a username and password. The system keeps logs of every user and every conducted enquiry.</p><p>The KPS offers the following enquiry services: </p><ul><li>web sites;</li><li>enquiry about personal information using the Turkish Republic Identity Number (TR Identity Number); </li><li>enquiry about the TR Identity Number using personal information; </li><li>enquiry about identity information based on information on the place of registration; </li><li>request of a copy of the civil status records using various criteria; and </li><li>web services (XML infrastructure). </li></ul><p>Users of the system are able to conduct enquiries by accessing the KPS web services using add-ons to their existing applications or by developing new applications, and then view the enquired data directly from their own applications and automatically update their own databases with the enquired information. </p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identity Management System Application</p><p>An identification verification system consisting of a user ID and a password is used in the framework of the eGovernment services provided by government agencies, with each agency producing its own IDs and passwords. Some government agencies meet their identification verification needs using the eSignature and mobile signature. Turksat is developing and offering agencies applications whereby identification verification systems like password, eSignature and mobile signature work in an integrated manner.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Authentication System</p><p>The Electronic Authentication System (EKDS) provides for the authentication of a person by recording the following information in the context of services provided in an electronic environment:</p><ul><li>the identity card was issued by the authorised institution;</li><li>the person is the owner of the card;</li><li>the person is at the place where the service is provided during authentication; and</li><li>where, when, by whom and why the authentication process was performed.</li></ul><p>Authentication is carried out via the Card Access Device (KEC). The KEC is a special card reader whose infrastructure was developed by TÜBİTAK BİLGEM for the new generation of electronic ID cards. Thanks to the Secure Access Module (GEM) inside the device, it can communicate securely with the ID card and read data fields that cannot be reached with standard card readers, such as the personal message and biometric data of the card holder. The KEC performs the verification with authentication methods according to the security policy determined by the external application software or policy server. Within the scope of the EKDS, an eSignature can be uploaded to the Turkish ID card thanks to the card’s features. </p><p>The EKDS Regulation was published in the Official Gazette No. 31282 dated 22 October 2020. Within the scope of this regulation, the infrastructure system for EKDS management was established by the Software Division of the DGCRC. The DGCRC aims to expand the use of the EKDS and the Turkish ID card eSignature feature in 2021.</p><p class="subtitle">Biometric Data Management System</p><p>Fingerprint data is taken from citizens for passport, driving license and Turkish ID Card applications received through MERNİS and this data is transferred to MERNİS through a programme. If the citizen’s fingerprint was previously provided for another instance within the system, the relevant intermediary programme verifies the fingerprint data. If the citizen does not have a previous fingerprint in the system, the programme takes the fingerprint record and shares it with the security units, and 1-N checks whether it matches with that of another citizen. </p><p>Due to the fact that the related intermediary programme works outside of MERNIS and the software was not developed by the DGCRC, as well as to disruptions in control processes and problems in sharing data with security units, the DGCRC developed a fingerprint acquisition and comparison software in cooperation with Havelsan in accordance with the 11<sup>th</sup> Development Plan.</p><p class="subtitle">Photograph Comparison System</p><p>Photographs of citizens taken in the last six months are demanded for passport, driving license and Turkish ID Card applications received through MERNİS. These photos are stored within the DGCRC’s database. A software which compares the new photograph submitted by the citizen at the time of the application with the photographs of the old applications in the system and verifies whether the person is the person in the new photograph, with an accuracy rate of 99.7%, was developed by the DGCRC’s Software Division. With this software, the aim is to prevent situations such as the need to detect citizens who have been the target of forgery but are not aware of it, the accepting of wrong photographs by personnel receiving applications and the issuance of documents on behalf of a different citizen.</p><p class="subtitle">Instant Messaging System </p><p>An Instant Messaging System (<em>Nüfus ve Vatandaşlık Işleri Genel Müdürlüğü İleti Sistemi</em>) was developed by the DGCRC’s Information Technologies Department in accordance with the Instant Messaging Security measure in the Information and Communication Security Guide published by the Digital Transformation Office of the Presidency on 24 July 2020. </p><p class="subtitle">Turkish National Electronic Identity Card </p><p>The Turkish National Electronic Identity Card is used by law as citizenship card in lieu of the birth certificate. The card allows the electronic identity verification at different security levels, offering the opportunity to safely access the services provided through electronic media. </p><p>The Electronic Identity Card is designed taking the international standards into consideration and contains the owner’s identity information, a biometric photograph and other biometric information.</p><p>Upon request of the card owner, the Electronic Identity Card can also be used as an eSignature tool with the installation of eSignature certificates. Additionally, the Electronic Identity Card can be utilized as travel document with the information contained in the contactless chip and in the machine-readable zone (MRZ) in the back of the card. </p><p>Card owners can change PIN numbers via the KIOSKS available in the Civil Registry Directorates and can perform actions such as removing the PIN block, changing the personal message and checking the card. </p><p>In addition, by using the PIN number through the Turkish National Electronic Identity Card, which is integrated into the eGovernment Gateway, card owners can also sign into the eGovernment portal.</p><p>The new chipped Electronic Identity Cards were introduced in 2017 and are now used by almost 57 million people, with the distribution still ongoing. </p><p class="subtitle">Address Registration System</p><p>The <a href="https://adres.nvi.gov.tr/">Address Registration System (AKS)</a> is a centrally administered system established by Law No. 5490 on Civil Registration Services where up-to-date domicile and other address information of Turkish nationals and foreigners domiciled in Turkey is maintained electronically. Authorized administrations (municipalities, special provincial administrations, organised industry and free zone directorates) are responsible for creating address information in accordance with address standards, keeping it up‑to‑date and entering building certificates into the UAVT.</p><p>The system is integrated with MERNIS, where records such as ‘Name, surname, mother’s and father’s name, place of birth and information on civil status events’ related to the person are stored and accessed using the Turkish Republic Identity Number (TR Identity Number).</p><p>A national address database was established using a standard address form set out by the municipalities and provincial special administrations, following which the address data held on this database was matched with the corresponding personal data using the TR Identity Numbers.</p><p>Pursuant to the provision contained in the Turkish Civil Code stating that “change of a domicile address is subject to the acquirement of another one”, the previous address of the person entered in the AKS is automatically deleted and archived following the declaration of a new domicile address. </p><p>As stated above, a declaration by the person is sufficient for the entry of the new address into the system. However, in case of a suspicious declaration, civil registration officials have the power to instigate an enquiry and file criminal complaints with the judicial authorities for the imposition of the imprisonment penalties and cash fines set out in the Civil Registration Services Law. The address change declaration can be done electronically by eSignature. </p><p>The system aims to reduce costs, and provide faster and more efficient public services, reducing the bureaucratic problems faced by users.</p><p class="subtitle">Spatial Address Registration System</p><p>The Spatial Address Registration System (MAKS) provides for the spatialisation of the verbal address information in the UAVT by using geographic information technologies.

Spatial data - which can be used in disaster and emergency management - were collected in physical environment or by web services from different governmental or non- governmental agencies to create a geodatabase as part of SIS. It is designed for accurate and quick decision making by spatial queries and analysis with existing and contemporaneously added data pre-disaster, during disaster and post-disaster activities.</li></ul><h2><a id="_Toc1474997"></a>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle">Cooperation with Azerbaijan</p><p>The development of a cross-border platform to facilitate the exchange of information and service provision between Turkey and Azerbaijan is ongoing.</p><p class="subtitle">Joint Use of Land Customs Crossing Points with Georgia</p><p>The Agreement between Turkey and Georgia on the Joint Use of the Land Customs Crossing Points of Sarpi–Sarp, Kartsakhi–Çıldır/Aktaş and Akhaltsikhe–Posof/Türkgözü, including the electronic exchange of data regarding the international movement of passengers, vehicles and goods, is in application.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">System of Base Registries</p><p>Five base registries exist in Turkey: the Centralised Legal Persons Information System (MERSIS), the Central Population Management System (MERNIS), the National Address Database (UAVT), the Land Registry and Cadastre Information System (TAKBIS), and the Vehicle Record and Registration System (ARTES). </p><p class="subtitle">Central Population Management System </p><p>The Central Population Management System (MERNIS) project transfers all civil status information to electronic media, and ensures that any changes that occur in said information are instantly updated from 970 centres scattered all over the country and shared securely over a network. The project aims to share information securely, update information quickly, and increase the speed and efficiency of the services provided to citizens. Within the scope of the project, different numbers used by institutions for Turkish citizens were unified, and different numbers and signs used by Turkish citizens in each institution were terminated. </p><p>The project is one of the first eGovernment projects in the world and has inspired all other similar projects in Turkey and Europe. It not only accelerated the Turkish government’s operations and proceedings with reliable information support, but also became key to the implementation of electronic government projects. Together with the Identity Sharing System (KPS) project, which is the continuation of MERNIS, a reliable, fast and efficient service was provided by making the information available to institutions, and additional paperwork was also prevented. </p><p class="subtitle">Centralised Legal Persons Information System</p><p>The Centralised Legal Persons Information System (MERSIS) is a centralized information system developed by the Ministry of Trade to ensure that the Commercial Registry transactions are carried out electronically and the Registry records are kept electronically. </p><p>With the implementation of MERSIS, significant progress has been made in terms of reducing administrative burdens and easing doing business. Thanks to MERSIS, Commercial Registry Directorates provide a one-stop-shop for the company establishment registration process. With this system, starting a business does not require to apply physically to the Tax Office and Social Security Institution anymore: thanks to the integration between MERSIS, and the Ministry of Finance and Social Security Institution, the tax and social security registration of companies is made electronically at the time of the establishment.</p><p>MERSIS was integrated into the eGovernment portal, enabling the authorised representatives of companies to carry out transactions through the portal. In addition, the number of eGovernment services offered to business owners using MERSIS as a verification source reached 98. Also, the information required by public institutions regarding the Commercial Registry is provided by MERSIS. The number of institutions sharing data reached 41, while the number of MERSIS users approached 1.5 million.</p><p>The scope of electronic services offered to citizens through MERSIS has been progressively extending. In this regard, the General Assembly module, electronic document service, electronic announcement service and appointment module are the most recent initiatives introduced by the Ministry of Trade. The General Assembly module ensures that the Ministry representative appointment procedures for the General Assembly meetings of joint stock companies are carried out electronically and the meeting documents are kept in an electronic environment. The eDocument service guarantees that all documents issued by the Commercial Registry Directorates, including the payment stages, can be obtained completely electronically through MERSIS and thus company representatives do not need to physically apply to the Commercial Registry Directorates. The eAnnouncement service ensures that the announcements of registration produced in MERSIS are sent to the Turkish Trade Registry Gazette electronically by Commercial Registry Directorates and announcements are published within two hours. Finally, the appointment module allows applicants to make an appointment at the Commercial Registry Directorate electronically, right after completing the registration application through MERSIS.</p><p class="subtitle">National Address Database</p><p>The National Address Database (UAVT) was developed to ensure that residence and other address information of individuals is kept in one place in accordance with the applying standards, and to share this information with public institutions and organisations within the framework of certain principles. </p><p class="subtitle">Land Registry and Cadastre Information System</p><p>The Land Registry and Cadastre Information System (TAKBİS) is an integrated information system developed for the purpose of transferring all Land Registry and Cadastre records across Turkey to the computers and carrying out the whole process over the system on computers, therefore ensuring the effective follow-up and control of immovables belonging to both the private and public sectors. </p><p>TAKBİS is one of the main eGovernment projects, aiming to transfer all ownership information across the country to computers and to allow to make any kind of query. </p><p class="subtitle">Vehicle Record and Registration System</p><p>The <a href="https://portal.tnb.org.tr/Artes/Sayfalar/AnaSayfa.aspx">Vehicle Record and Registration System (ARTES)</a> was developed to ensure that the services of vehicle sale, transfer and registration are reliable, up-to-date and in line with the norms of the European Union and eGovernment. In addition, the system allows to finalize the procedures at a single application point through the extensive notary network.</p><p>More in detail, the services covered are as follows: first registration of the vehicle, technical changes in the vehicle (modification), follow-up of other institutions’ rights claimed on the vehicle (deprivation of rights, pledge and distraint), vehicle handover (transfer and sale) and vehicle scrapping.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Turkish Brain Project</p><p>The Brain Tumor Research project, or the ‘Turkish Brain Project’, tries to support Turkish doctors by detecting brain tumors or anomalies rapidly and eventually saving hundreds of lives. The project is carried out in collaboration with the Gazi University Hospital and the Faculty of Engineering. </p><p>According to statistical data from the Ministry of Health in 2018, the number of images taken per magnetic resonance (MR) scanner in Turkey is the highest in the world. The same report states that the number of MR images per 1 000 people is 186. The ‘Turkish Brain Project’ is a research project that was initiated in order to reduce the workload of Turkish doctors in the Turkish healthcare system, where the number of MR images exceeds 15 million. Within the scope of the project, AI systems were used in order to implement various analyses on a vast number of brain MR images. As soon as the image is received from the MR device, the AI system automatically analyses the image and sends the results back to the hospital. The AI system also makes prioritisations based on the analysis results, thereby helping patients who may need urgent intervention. Good results were achieved in AI-diagnosed tumors, with an accuracy rate of 95%. Another goal of the project was to generate added value from the data. The next goal is to offer this AI system to the hospitals throughout the country.</p><p class="subtitle">Detection of COVID-19 in the Lungs with AI</p><p>AI is a cross-cutting field that requires multiple disciplines to work together. In this context, the Digital Transformation Office efficiently collaborates with healthcare workers and universities. </p><p>The spread of the pandemic was very rapid and the social distancing measures accelerated the digital transformation. However, most of the burden was and still is on precious healthcare workers who kept working breathlessly. For them, the questions to ask were simple: who is healthy?, and does the patient suffer from COVID-19 or is the pneumonia unrelated to COVID? </p><p>As of the date when the COVID-19 outbreak was announced by the World Health Organisation, the Digital Transformation Office started working on this issue. When the need for fast diagnosis and urgency come together, the support of AI solutions cannot be denied. Therefore, in order to alleviate the increasing workload of Turkish doctors and healthcare workers, the Digital Transformation Office started working on the AI Decision Support System to increase the effectiveness of chest radiography in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Even though data were limited, a good success rate was achieved. More specifically, the diagnosis of pneumonia and COVID-19 reached a success rate of 86% using x-ray imaging systems.</p><p class="subtitle">Easy Export Platform</p><p>The Easy Export Platform (EEP) is an AI-based project that was developed to provide a single point for all data-related needs of exporters. The first phase of the EEP was launched in August 2020 and the second in March 2021. The EEP was established to ensure Turkish exporters can closely follow global commercial data. Within this context, various pieces of information are needed by exporters to make healthy projections about their future work. Thanks to the EEP, all information necessary for Turkish exporters is provided by a single platform and presented within a new ecosystem in a user-friendly format. In the platform, up-to-date data and information obtained from public and paid databases, such as the UN Comtrade, the databases of the World Bank and Euromonitor, as well as data kept by various General Directorates of the competent Ministry, are constantly and automatically available on the relevant pages. </p><p>While providing a wide range of information through a single channel, the EEP provides consultancy to Turkish exporters as to the market selection by using disruptive technologies such as machine learning algorithms. The Smart Export Robot, one of the most important modules of the platform, operates in four layers using more than 10 million lines of data for more than 10 000 data fields compiled from national and international sources, together with the export history of companies. The Smart Export Robot then provides target market recommendations to companies by calculating a score for each country. The users also have the flexibility to rank the target markets recommended according to their own preferences. </p><p>The platform also promotes product diversification by using micro import and export data. By using association rules similar to the recommendation systems in eCommerce platforms, the EEP suggests the most suitable alternative products to diversify export portfolios. </p><p class="subtitle">Foreigners Communication Centre (YIMER 157) </p><p>A Speech Analytics and Interactive Voice Response System will be integrated into YİMER 157 in 2021. That way, all incoming calls to YİMER 157 will be audited by means of ‘voice analysis software’ and issues such as the satisfaction measurement of the person receiving the service, the correctness of the information given and the possible negative events during the call will be identified instantly. Moreover, thanks to the Interactive Voice Response System foreigners will be able to inquire about their residence permit and annotated visa application status without connecting to the foreign representative, using the application number given to them via the voice response system (<a href="https://yimer.gov.tr/EN/Index">https://yimer.gov.tr/EN/Index</a>).</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc29374626"></a><a id="_Toc30431112"></a><a id="_Hlk30431861"></a><a id="_Hlk30434112"></a></p><p><a id="_Toc36799077"></a></p><p><img src="img/35-643.png" alt="35-643.png" /></p><p>	Cross-border </p><p>Digital Public Administration Services </p><p>7</p><h1>Cross-border Digital Public Administration Services for Citizens and Businesses</h1><p><a id="_Hlk30431782"></a>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad.
