The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-231.png" alt="35-231.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Cyprus in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-250.jpeg" alt="35-250.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Cyprus’ results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). However, areas of improvements are  concentrated in Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) particularly for which a score of 1 is reported, as well as Principles 2 (Openness), 3 (Transparency) and 10 (Administrative simplification) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, Cyprus should ensure that its national interoperability framework and interoperability strategy are aligned with the EIF ones, and if needed, it should tailor and extend them to address the national context and needs (Principle 1 – Recommendation 01). In addition, the country should foster the use of open-source software (Principle 2 – Recommendation 03) and further simplify processes and use digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services (Principle 10 – Recommendation 17) , as these recommendations are only partially met and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4.</p><p><img src="img/35-263.jpeg" alt="35-263.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Cypriot results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance with only scores of 4, except for the recommendations related to the area of legal interoperability which has a score of 1. To further enhance Cyprus’ score in this area, the country should put in place ‘interoperability checks’ when it introduces new legislation, in order to identify any barriers to interoperability. In addition, when drafting a new legislation, it should seek to make it consistent with relevant legislation, perform a ‘digital check’ and consider data protection requirements (Recommendation 27).</p><p><img src="img/35-279.jpeg" alt="35-279.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Cyprus’ scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an overall good performance in the implementation of all recommendations, aligned with the European average, except for the area related to the conceptual model itself. This is due to a lack of data for Recommendation 35, on the presence or not of a common scheme for the interconnection of service components and the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining European public services. </p><p>Additional information on Cyprus’ results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

Cooperation will focus on defining a strategic agenda along with the design and implementation of concrete actions, in order to develop the environment that will enable citizens to better access public sector information and services. The National eID project was one of the flagship projects where the expertise and experience of the Estonian government have been used. </p><p>Furthermore, the President of the Republic plans to sign an amended Memorandum of Understanding with the Estonian Prime Minister, during his visit in May 2021, where new areas of collaboration in the eGovernment sector will be defined. </p><p class="subtitle">Public Administration Reform (PAR)</p><p>The <a href="http://www.reform.gov.cy/en/">Public Administration Reform (PAR)</a> is considered a very important structural change aimed at creating flexible, modern and productive public services for the benefit of both citizens and businesses. The PAR aims to solve horizontal and sectoral issues. In relation to the horizontal/cross-cutting issues, the reform of human resource management (HRM) across the public sector is planned. More specifically, the government submitted a set of legislative proposals to the House of Representatives, aiming at the introduction of a new performance appraisal system, the improvement of promotion procedures, Public Service Commission governance and mobility enhancement.</p><p>With regards to sectoral issues, functional reviews were completed within the civil services domain (Ministries and Constitutional/Independent Services) aimed at the reorganisation of structures within the various ministries and independent authorities, and generally the provision of better services to businesses and citizens. </p><p class="subtitle">Action Plan on Better Regulation</p><p>The third and final progress report for the Action Plan on Better Regulation that covered the period from 2015 to 2018 was submitted to the Ministerial Council in late 2019.

The plan consists of three priority axes:</p><ul><li>Simplification of procedures and legislation and reduction of the administrative burden;</li><li>Better law-making and impact assessment (IA) of new legislation; and </li><li>Embedding the culture and enhancing relevant skills in relation to the Action Plan on Better Regulation.</li></ul><p>The IA mechanism, put in place in 2017 to undertake more focused and thorough IAs for new legislation, was embedded and is now a mandatory part of the legal drafting procedure. An IA report summarising the main findings and suggestions for the way forward was published in 2018. Its intention was to continue the training programme of government officials and further enhance the implementation of the new IA framework.</p><p>Further to the above three axes, the action plan also included actions that are being promoted under the pillar of eGovernment, which go hand in hand with the other Better Regulation initiatives.</p><p class="subtitle">Partnership Agreement </p><p>The <a href="http://www.structuralfunds.org.cy/Partnership-Agreement">2014–2020 Partnership Agreement (PA)</a> is the strategic document prepared by the government of Cyprus for the effective utilisation of European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) allocated to the country for the programming period 2014–2020. The PA includes Cyprus general development priorities and the pursuit of general objectives for the use of ESI Funds, as derived from the analysis of the country’s development needs and perspectives, as well as the thematic objectives that Cyprus selected to invest into during the 2014–2020 programming period. </p><p>ICT is among the selected sectors for investment, with the main aim being the promotion of the use of ICT in the public and private sectors to improve the competitiveness of the economy. The implementation of the PA is further specified in the Operational Programmes (OP), which are determined according to the type of each ESI fund.</p><p>A new PA is currently under preparation, aiming to utilize the funds allocated to Cyprus from the EU Cohesion Policy and Common Fisheries Policy for the programming period 2021–2027.</p><p class="subtitle">Operational Programme ‘Competitiveness and Sustainable Development’ </p><p><a id="_Toc1474959"></a><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>The promotion of ICT use is one of the seven priority axes of the 2014–2020 OP ‘<a href="http://www.dgepcd.gov.cy/dgepcd/dgepcd.nsf/page09_en/page09_en?OpenDocument">Competitiveness and Sustainable Development’</a>. The budget of the axis is around EUR 40 million (6% of the OP’s total budget), which is co-financed by the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF) with EUR 33.5 million. Around 85% of this budget was allocated to strengthening ICT applications for eGovernment, eLearning and eHealth. </p><p>A new programme is currently under preparation, aiming to utilize the funds allocated to Cyprus from the EU Cohesion Policy for the programming period 2021–2027.</p><p class="subtitle">Recovery and Resilience Facility</p><p>The <a href="http://www.cyprus-tomorrow.gov.cy">Recovery and Resilience Facility</a> (thereafter called the Facility) is the centrepiece of ‘<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/health/coronavirus-response/recovery-plan-europe/pillars-next-generation-eu_en">Next Generation EU</a>’, a temporary recovery instrument that allows the Commission to raise funds to help repair the immediate economic and social damage brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The Facility is also closely aligned with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024_en">Commission’s priorities</a>, ensuring a sustainable and inclusive recovery in the long-term that promotes the green and digital transitions. The Facility will provide EUR 672.5 billion in loans and grants available to support reforms and investments undertaken by the Member States.</p><p>Each Member State should prepare a Recovery and Resilience Plan (RRP), which will include its reforms and investments for the years 2021–2023, with a horizon of implementation by 2026. </p><p>Within this context, the Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy of Cyprus has submitted a comprehensive plan for reforms and investments in digital transformation areas, to be included in the national plan, amounting to a total of EUR 136 million. Proposals in the areas of research and innovation have also been included.</p><p>The proposed projects fall under the following policy domains:</p><p>1. Upgrade Infrastructure for Connectivity (EUR 53 million):</p><p>Ensuring 5G and fibre coverage for 100% of the population living in organized communities, including deployment of 5G along the main terrestrial corridors, and enabling universal and affordable access to Gigabit connectivity in all urban and rural areas, including 5G and Gigabit connectivity, in line with the EU 2025 5G and Gigabit connectivity objectives. Additionally, a high level of broadband connectivity is key for digital services to be practical, accessible and, of course, affordable; the aim is to facilitate high-speed connectivity, as well as proceed with the deployment of 5G networks within 2021. The main objective of this component is to bridge divides and ensure an inclusive digital transformation. Ensuring adequate access to communication infrastructures for all citizens is essential for the realization of the opportunities of digital transformation. To ensure an inclusive digital transformation, it is necessary to bridge the gaps, so that opportunities can be harnessed by everyone.</p><p>2. Promote e-Government (EUR 46 million):</p><p>eGovernment projects are developed through a 2-tier approach, more specifically through the rapid deployment of small-scale digital solutions (microservices) and the parallel long-term implementation of mega e-government projects. There is a holistic approach encompassing all governmental authorities. The ultimate goal is to create an end-to-end high-quality experience for citizens and businesses throughout their interactions and ‘touch-points’ with the public sector, drive cost efficiencies, enhance reliability, security and resilience, and draw genuine trust in the system and the technologies themselves. Flagship projects of this domain include the Digital Services Factory, the implementation of government Cloud-G Cloud, the digital transformation of Courts, the modernization of customs and electronic payment system, the integrated information system for the Registrar of Companies and Official Receiver.</p><p>3. Smart Cities (EUR 35 million):</p><p>The DMRID has been appointed to take the leading and coordinating role in developing a nation-wide strategy on Smart Cities, orchestrating, through a well-crafted plan, the Smart-cities framework, as well as all supporting initiatives and smart-cities building blocks. The key objective is to manage the existing on-going initiatives and include them in a nationwide plan, enhanced and complemented with additional initiatives, implementation plan, governance and steering mechanisms that can transform the quality of life and citizen experience, optimise cities’ use of resources and services, and lead to operational efficiencies and revenue maximization.</p><p>4. Digital Skills (EUR 2 million):</p><p>This initiative has been specifically designed and formulated for the enhancement of digital skills across all population groups (public administration, enterprises and society at large) as well as the promotion of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and professional paths, so as to effectively address the market shortage in ICT professionals.</p><p>Notably, the DMRID has a horizontal and vertical role in the utilization and successful implementation of the RRP, in that it will operate both as the implementation body for its own projects and as a monitoring body for projects of digital nature implemented by other public and wider public organizations/agencies. </p><p>All of the above projects and initiatives are aligned with the National Digital Strategy, and their implementation will accelerate Cyprus digital transformation and improve its position in the DESI index, moving closer to the EU average.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle">National Scheme</p><p>In February 2019, the eGovernment Board made a new decision regarding the adoption of eIdentification: the government will prepare a national scheme on eIdentification and eSignature by changing relevant legislations.

The SMS is a crucial element of the restructuring plan of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport and Youth, which aims to create an advanced computerised system that will ensure proper information management and process automation. The SMS will contribute to the streamlining of bureaucracy, the reduction of high administrative costs and it will ensure the prompt provision of information, cooperation and support of various stakeholders. The different services offered by the SMS will be gradually introduced until the expected ending date of the project in 2023. The total cost for the implementation of the system is around EUR 10 million, which will be co-financed by both national resources and the ERDF 2021–2027. </p><p>In support of the project, this year, a number of tablets were delivered to all upper secondary schools, in order to prepare, empower and develop the digital skills of the educators for the application of the SMS. </p><p class="subtitle">National Coalition for Digital Jobs</p><p>Cyprus has drafted a holistic <a href="http://www.digitaljobs.cyprus-digitalchampion.gov.cy/el/page/home">action plan</a> aimed at the enhancement of digital skills across all population groups (public administration, enterprises and society at large), as well as the promotion of STEM education and professional paths, so as to effectively address the market shortage in ICT professionals. The goal is to deliver an open, accessible and inclusive digital society, able to actively participate in socioeconomic activities, fully reap the benefits of digital transformation and act as a driver for an accelerated digital transition. It includes actions aimed at the integration of digital skills in the educational system and the alignment of educational curricula with industry needs, the upskilling and reskilling of both the public and the private sectors, and the promotion of a culture of life-long learning and innovation.</p><p>Interventions addressed to the public sector aim to eliminate one of its main deficiencies, i.e. the lack of specialised skillsets and experience to support digital transformation, both in terms of designing and implementing eGovernment and other digital projects, and of using the new information technology (IT) systems/processes/digital services etc. </p><p>Upskilling is about anticipating the right skills for the future, laying the cultural foundation, delivering modern programmes, and building a learning and development culture within enterprises. It includes upskilling and reskilling programmes, from basic to advanced level, for graduates, professionals, and unemployed, aimed at bridging the digital divide, covering industry needs, improving employability opportunities, increasing the country’s competitive edge as a hub for sciences, tech and startup companies, and promoting growth and innovation activities. </p><p>Actions addressed to the enhancement of the digital skills of the general population include remote areas, vulnerable groups such as the elderly and people with disabilities, so as to ensure inclusiveness and equal opportunities. </p><p>In addition, Cyprus is developing a dynamic, easy-to-use and accessible e-learning platform, containing a self-assessment tool for digital fitness, an index of all available skilling programmes, and content material on digital skills and cross-sectoral competences such as project management. </p><p class="subtitle">Cyprus Broadband Plan </p><p>The <a href="http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/dec/dec.nsf/All/10849A48077172ADC2257FBE00248B9D/$file/Cyprus_Broadband_Plan.pdf?OpenElement">2016–2020 Broad</a>band Plan was developed by the Department of Electronic Communications to outline the key actions and steps necessary to meet the first general objective of the Digital Strategy for Cyprus, which is the creation of appropriate infrastructure and the necessary conditions to connect the Republic of Cyprus. The objectives of the plan, which is still in place, are: </p><ul><li><strong>to ensure the roll-out and take-up of broadband for all, at increasing speeds, through fixed and wireless technology; </strong></li><li><strong>to promote competition in electronic communications and reduce prices of broadband services and products; </strong></li><li><strong>to connect the whole of Cyprus with high and ultra-high-speed networks; </strong></li><li><strong>to address cyber threats and generally strengthen security in the digital networks; and</strong></li><li><strong>to enhance the international sub-marine cable network, connecting Cyprus to Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</strong> </li></ul><p><strong>The Cyprus Broadband Plan was updated during 2018, taking into account the existing network mapping, the telecommunications providers’ plans for the next three years, the Digital Agenda for Europe 2020 and the Commission’s Communications of September 2016 entitled ‘Connectivity for a Competitive Digital Single Market – Towards </strong>a European Gigabit Society’ and ‘5G for Europe: An Action Plan’. In relation to<strong> connectivity, the main goals to be achieved by 2025 are the full coverage of very high-capacity networks and 70% take-up of ultrafast services (at least 100 Mbps) in case of demand by households and enterprises.</strong></p><p><strong>Broadband coverage has generally been improving across Cyprus and has met the 2020 target for ubiquitous 30 Mbps coverage, but not all EU targets for 2020 were achieved. Suburban and rural areas, where there are less incentives for the private sector to invest in ultrafast broadband provision, remain uncovered in comparison with urban areas, and ultrafast take-up is significantly behind target. It is obvious that a digital divide persists in Cyprus, even though some progress has been made in the last few years. The </strong><a href="http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/mcw.nsf">Department of Electronic Communications</a><strong> is in the process of drafting a new National Broadband Plan for the period 2021</strong>–<strong>2025 which will focus on expanding ultra-high-speed networks coverage and demand by utilising EU funding and other State aid resources. The new National Broadband Plan will be ready by the third quarter of 2021.</strong></p><p class="subtitle">Reform of the Justice System</p><p>The reform anticipates qualitative changes to the justice system with the goal of strengthening the flexibility, effectiveness, and speed of the decision-making process. As part of the reform, an electronic court administration system will be introduced to digitalise the operations of the different courts. To this end, a tender to purchase a license for a web-based court administration system (eJustice system), including training of personnel, and the option to acquire the system by the government, was launched. The eJustice system will be installed in the premises of every court in Cyprus, and it will be possible to manage all procedures of a legal case. Additionally, the eJustice system will provide electronic services to court personnel, law offices, police, governmental departments, private law companies, lawyers, the bar association, private companies, citizens and private service provides (e.g. audit firms, land development companies, certifying officers etc.). Pending full implementation of the eJustice system, a mini electronic registry has been prepared and installed in all civil registries of the Supreme Court to process applications more efficiently.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">National Strategy on Decentralised Technologies and Blockchain</p><p>The <a href="http://mof.gov.cy/assets/modules/wnp/articles/201907/480/docs/blockchain_strategy_english_final.pdf">National Strategy on Decentralised Technologies and Blockchain</a> was approved on 18 June 2019 by the Council of Ministers in Cyprus. The national strategy focuses on three priorities:</p><ul><li>Priority 1 - preparing an enabling legislative framework;</li><li>Priority 2 - enhancing the application of the technology by the government and the private sector; and</li><li>Priority 3 - promoting DLT in the financial sector.</li></ul><p>Priority 1<strong>:</strong> The new legislation on DLT and blockchain is under preparation and is expected to be concluded by the end of the year. An umbrella law will be proposed, that will cover all possible future innovations and create a framework that will regulate the industry and include amendments to other specific related laws, such as the Property Law and the Evidence Law. The prepared framework is technologically neutral so as to promote innovation, but also robust so as to protect consumers. The national legislation will be available well ahead of the European Regulation, which will act as complementary to the national legislation for possible unregulated crypto-assets. </p><p>Priority 2:<strong> </strong>In December 2019 a Request for Interest (RFI) was announced, to consolidate the interest from the market and identify the most promising domains for which the Republic of Cyprus stands to attain the greatest benefits, if it incorporates blockchain technology. Based on the domains identified, a national blockchain Proof of Concept call for proposals is now under preparation for privately developed solutions to be applied in the public sector.</p><p>Priority 3: An Innovation Hub was launched by the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) in 2018<a href="https://www.cysec.gov.cy/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=a3f09f20-2909-43aa-8ed6-4c1812eb8093">.</a> The hub serves as a two-way communication channel between regulators and companies in an attempt to foster innovation and an informed regulatory landscape on the topic of transformative technologies. </p><p class="subtitle">European Blockchain Partnership and MED 7 Cooperation</p><p>Cyprus, together with 25 other Member States, signed the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-countries-join-blockchain-partnership">Declaration for Cooperation on a European Blockchain Partnership (EBP)</a>.

The establishment of a special Task Force for Researchers is also considered to help the AI Expert Group in developing AI policies.</p><p>Networking: in this field, the Cypriot strategy highlights the need to encourage partnerships with leading international organisations to increase the level of research and innovation in AI. This will be achieved by setting up new collaboration models. </p><p>Regulation: the Cypriot government will develop a <strong>clear legislative framework</strong> to ensure the availability of data with transparent regulations, in particular on data protection. This legislative framework will take into account the EU directives on the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018R1807" target="_blank">free flow of data</a> and on <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj" target="_blank">general data protection</a> and will facilitate data interoperability.</p><p>Infrastructure: the Cypriot government commits to creating a <strong>data ecosystem</strong> with clear regulations on data interoperability and data exchange agreements.</p><p><img src="img/35-442.jpeg" alt="A gavel on a desk

The main objective is to set up a digital database/registry of all lost artworks, with the aim of having them identified and eventually returned to their legitimate owners.</p><p class="subtitle">CyprusFlightPass</p><p>To facilitate the arrangements of passengers travelling to Cyprus and ensure reception of all necessary information required by the health authorities, the <a href="https://cyprusflightpass.gov.cy/">CyprusFlightPass (CFP)</a> online platform was created. It enables passengers to complete all the necessary formalities in a quick and easy way and receive the relevant authorisation to fly. </p><p>Prior to their trip, passengers travelling from any country must obtain the ‘Cyprus Flight Pass’. For each country, specific conditions and prerequisites apply (i.e. PCR tests or vaccination certificates) which are managed through this platform in an effort to (a) comply with the related governmental decrees and (b) minimize the spreading of Covid-19.</p><p>The platform also facilitates the electronic process for obtaining a special permit. Third -country nationals travelling to the Republic of Cyprus from a country not included in green, orange, and red categories are required to obtain a special permit beforehand. For specific passengers’ categories, the platform also allows for the electronic pre-payment for covering the required accommodation and laboratory tests amount.</p><p>The CFP platform is up and running as of the 9 of June 2020. Cyprus was the first country at a European level to create an online platform to follow the indications for a Passenger Locator Form as set by ICAO (Annex 9). Passengers’ information and personal data remain confidential and are being processed only for public-interest purposes and the protection of public health from COVID-19. </p><p>Around 540 000 users have already registered in the CFP platform and have issued a CFP within 2020. One of its main benefits is that it helps fast tracking cases of passengers getting in close contact with a COVID-19 confirmed-case passenger and cases of positive COVID-19 passengers in Cyprus (e.g. hotel, residence address). </p><p class="subtitle">Interim Solution of Electronic Justice: i-Justice </p><p>Justice reform is widely recognized among the highest priority areas and categorized as a project of public interest in Cyprus. </p><p>The <a href="https://ijustice.judicial.gov.cy/">interim solution</a> aimed to address the most pressing needs of the judicial system until completion of the full design and implementation of an integrated e-justice system, namely basic features such as case registration, payment of relevant fees, communication of the system internal and external users. </p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic called for the implementation of an interim solution until the fully-fledged system described above is fully functional. This interim solution (called i-Justice) enabled the absolutely necessary digital functioning of the Courts. The i-Justice solution does not only aim to cover the basic needs between 2020 and 2022, until the fully-fledged system will be fully functional, but it also lays the foundations for a smoother transition to the new digital era in the field of justice, in addition to addressing early on possible impediments/risks that would otherwise arise during the implementation of the permanent solution. </p><p>The i-Justice system also provides for the creation of electronic case files, accessible to beneficiary users either for case management or case monitoring, while facilitating a two-way communication between internal (courts and court registrars) and external users (lawyers, law firms and citizens). Access is provided to both internal users which include the Law Office of the Republic, the courts, the police and other governmental authorities, as well as external users, which include law firms and other private sector entities as well as individual citizens. </p><p>By simplifying the filing, control of and access to legal documents, monitoring cases can be easier, thus facilitating the work of the judiciary. As a result, a more efficient delivery of justice will be achieved, minimizing time and administrative costs, while increasing transparency and quality of output. Most importantly, it will enhance and accelerate the service delivery to the public, minimizing the need for on-site visits, and increasing confidence in the system and State institutions as a whole. A very important element of the project is the fact that it includes a business-continuity plan, protecting against future crises or adverse situations.</p><p>Furthermore, the cases already registered electronically in the i-justice system, will be simply migrated to the holistic e-justice system, while users will be already familiar with its functionalities. This is a highly important side benefit, as it will reinforce the justice ecosystem and its stakeholders and enhance their readiness and willingness to accept and embrace this fundamental reform, while ‘forcing’ - in a way – the redesign of related administrative processes to fit the new digital environment. </p><p class="subtitle">Online Registration of Primary and Secondary School Students</p><p>Aiming to minimize the physical presence at schools, due to COVID, an <a href="https://engrafes.moec.gov.cy/register/home">eService</a> has been developed by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport and Youth in cooperation with the Deputy Ministry of Research, whereby parents can electronically confirm their children's enrolment without having to go in person to the schools. </p><p class="subtitle">Road Transport Department Online Services</p><p>The Road Transport Department (RTD) has been innovative in offering <a href="https://rtd.mcw.gov.cy/WebPhase1/gui/Common/LoginFrameGreek.jsp?lang=en">online services</a> to the public and to special interest groups from 2004 to this day.

It includes Import, Tariff, Esktort (risk analysis), Accounting, Bonded, Penalties, Quota, Manifest, RefTab (reference tables) and the Trans-European systems consisting of the Import Control System, the Export Control System, the Excise Movement and Control System, the New Computerised Transit System, the Economic Operators Registration &amp; Identification System and Risk Analysis.</p><p>All customs stations are connected to the system via the intranet, operating over the Government Data Network. The THESEAS systems have the following interfaces:</p><ul><li>An interface with the Cyprus Ports Authority for the electronic submission of cargo manifests and a standard XML development has been made available to traders for bulk input to the system;</li><li>An interface with the EU and other Member States through the CCN/CSI network; and</li><li>An interface with other stakeholders through web interface or B2B interface. </li></ul><p>In addition, the system supports:</p><ul><li>The electronic submission of cargo; </li><li>The submission of declarations (Manifest, Import, Import Control System, Export Control System, Excise Movement and Control System); and</li><li>The electronic payment of customs duties.</li></ul><p>Currently, Cyprus, along with other Member States in the EU, promotes the implementation of a new Information System for the Customs Department aimed at ensuring the correct application of the Union Customs Code (UCC) Work Plan of the European Union. The UCC was enacted in order to modernise and simplify trade into and within the EU and to harmonise the customs procedures across Member States.</p><p class="subtitle">EESSI – Electronic Exchange of Social Insurance Information </p><p>Cyprus has implemented EU rules on social security coordination by participating in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=869">EESSI – Electronic Exchange of Social Insurance Information</a> project. This IT system helps social security institutions across the EU to exchange information more rapidly and securely and is gradually replacing paper-based exchanges. Currently, the software implementation has been completed, and the system is up and running with close to 80% of business use cases (BUCs) in production. The project is expected to cover soon more than 80% of BUCs.</p><p class="subtitle">National Contact Point for Cross Border Healthcare</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/health/sites/health/files/cross_border_care/docs/cbhc_ncp_en.pdf">National Contact Point for Cross Border Healthcare</a> project is being developed to comply with the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32011L0024">Cross-Border Healthcare Directive</a>. The ultimate goal is to provide all EU citizens with equal access to quality healthcare, responding to their specific needs. Whether that means seeking a second opinion in another Member State or taking a child with a rare disease to a specialist on the other side of the EU, people need the reassurance that they will receive the best care possible and that they will not be left to shoulder the financial burden alone. To achieve this result, one of the key points is to improve access to information on healthcare in other European countries.<a id="_Toc1474998"></a></p><p class="subtitle">Interconnection of Insolvency Registers</p><p>The Department of Insolvency has successfully concluded the conformance testing of the national insolvency registers connection to the central IRI search platform, in line with the requirements of Regulation 2015/848 and the eJustice portal technical specifications for the interconnection of insolvency registers.</p><p class="subtitle">EURES</p><p>EURES (European Employment Services) is a cooperation network formed by public employment services. Trade unions and employers’ organisations also participate as partners. The objective of the EURES network is to facilitate the free movement of workers within the European Economic Area (EEA) (the 27 members of the European Union, plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) and Switzerland. EURES targets both jobseekers interested in moving to another country to work or to study, and employers wishing to recruit from abroad.</p><p class="subtitle">EUCARIS</p><p>EUCARIS (European Car and Driving Licence Information System) is an initiative of several European countries and can be described as a system that connects countries or a cooperation between several national registration authorities. Formalised in a multilateral treaty, this cooperation is focused on the exchange of data regarding vehicle registration, driving licences, the accompanying personal data and other transport-related data. EUCARIS is neither a database nor a central repository but rather an exchange mechanism that connects the Vehicle and Driving Licence Registration Authorities in Europe. Each country is responsible for its own registry of vehicle and driving licence information and its own registration procedures. Through their national registration authority, other government institutions can request information on e.g. vehicles from another country. The system contributes, amongst others, to the fight against car theft and registration fraud.</p><p>EUCARIS is a system on which several applications run, such as RESPER (<em>Réseau permis de conduire</em> / Driver’s License Network), ERRU (European Register of Road Transport Undertakings), CBE (Cross Border Exchange), etc., all serving a different legal basis, such as the EUCARIS Treaty, EU Council decisions and several bilateral Treaties. </p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Interconnecting EU Land Registers</p><p>The Department of Lands and Surveys is one of the main Base Registries in Cyprus. In 2018, data exchange (property searches) became available for all governmental departments through the Government Data Warehouse. In rare instances, this can also be done through web services (system-to-system).</p><p>The Department of Lands and Surveys is implementing the INSPIRE Directive, and the requirements of the eJustice portal to connect the European Land Registers.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Registry of Sworn Translators</p><p>On 1 July 2019, the current system of certified translations provided by the Press and Information Office was terminated, according to <a href="http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/indexes/2019_1_45.html">Law No. 45 (Ι)/2019</a>, which provides for the registration and regulation of the services of the sworn translators in Cyprus. In order to facilitate the public’s access to the registry of sworn translators, a <a href="https://www.pio.gov.cy/en/register-of-sworn-translators.html">digital Registry</a> is available which functions as a search engine.</p><p class="subtitle">Road Transport Department Registry</p><p>The Road Transport Department is one of the base Registries in Cyprus as it is responsible for the vehicles’ and drivers’ digital registry. Data exchange became available for all governmental departments through the Government Data Warehouse and, in some instances, it can also be done through web services (system-to-system) via the Government Gateway - Ariadni. In addition, data exchange is available to other EU countries through EUCARIS, which uses the TESTA network.</p><p>Digital Platform for Energy Performance Certificates</p><p>In the framework of the Law that regulates the energy performance of buildings, a national Registry for Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) and a Registry for Qualified Experts have been introduced. An EPC has to be issued by a qualified expert for new buildings and buildings that are for sale or for rent. The Issuing of an EPC can be done only through the digital platform for EPC. Qualified experts can access the platform through the Ariadne Getaway Government Portal. Furthermore, the platform is used by qualified experts to register and to renew their registration. MECI is currently working on the digitalization of the registries of all independent experts’ and installers related to energy efficiency and renewable energy.</p><h2>Emerging Technologies</h2><h2>No digital public administration infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.<a id="_Toc30514844"></a></h2><p><img src="img/35-623.jpeg" alt="35-623.jpeg" /></p><p>	Cross-border </p><p>Digital Public Administration Services </p><p>7</p><h1><a id="_Toc77780434"></a>Cross border Digital Public Administration Services for Citizens and Businesses</h1><p>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad.
