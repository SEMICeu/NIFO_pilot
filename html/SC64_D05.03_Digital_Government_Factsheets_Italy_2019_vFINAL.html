Both plans were defined by the Agency for Digital Italy and the Ministry of Economic Development under the coordination of the Prime Minister.</p><p>The new national plan for Ultra-wideband proposed a virtuous mix of public and private investment. Where individuals invest in equal measure to the public, the goal that can be reached is higher than the European minimum. The objective of the Strategy for the Italian Ultra-wideband is to remedy this infrastructure gap and market, creating favourable conditions for the integrated development of telecommunications infrastructure, fixed and mobile, with actions such as:</p><ul><li>Incentives aimed at bringing down the barriers of cost of implementation, simplifying and reducing administrative burdens;</li><li>Coordination in the management of the subsurface through the establishment of a cadastre of below and above ground to ensure the monitoring of operations and the best use of existing infrastructure;</li><li>Adaptation to other European countries in the field of electromagnetism limits;</li><li>Tax incentives and credit at subsidised rates in the most profitable areas to promote the "quantum leap";</li><li>Public incentives to invest in marginal areas;</li><li>Direct realisation of public infrastructure in the areas of market failure.</li></ul><p>Public resources are available to European funds ERDF and EAFRD, the Development Fund and Cohesion, for a total of 6 EUR billion, in addition to the funds from the Juncker Plan.</p><p>The national plan for Ultra-wideband is tied to the Strategy for Digital Growth. The strategy has a dynamic character, in order to be able to adapt gradually to the scenarios in the reference period 2014-2020. It is a strategy aimed at enabling digitally-literate citizens and businesses, with the help of public levers. </p><p>With the Login Italia project, the Government intends to build the house of the citizen. The system is designed as an open structure where the various actors of the public administration contribute to their area of expertise. The PA creates a single platform and opens its data and provides the services available to businesses and citizens. It is necessary to develop a new design for a new public information system in order to become more user-centred. Every citizen with their digital identity can access all the information and services concerning himself/herself on Login Italia: a "home" on the Internet, a single sign-on for all services of the public administration, to receive alerts and deadline notifications, and to make and receive payments.</p><p>Implementation of the Italian Digital Agenda requires the coordination of multiple actions by public administration, businesses and civil society, and requires management of the various sources of national and Community funding (at central and regional levels).</p><p class="subtitle">Three-Year Plan for IT in the Public Administration</p><p>The <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/">Three-Year Plan for IT in the public administration</a> was defined in accordance with what is stated in the <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/en/faqs/">Digital Growth Strategy</a>, including actions, definition of financial needs and the indicators represented therein, with the aim of targeting public sector ICT investments according to government guidelines and in line with European goals and programmes. The Plan proposes a systematic, distributed and shared model of management and use of the most innovative digital technologies, characterised by an agile and evolutionary management style, based on clear governance of the various levels of public administration. The synergy and balance between the three directives (innovative technologies, agile management style and clear and effective model of governance) ensures the country’s system uses more effectively the benefits of new technologies and provides citizens with an advantage in terms of ease of access and improvement of existing digital services.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/">Agency for Digital Italy</a> has assumed the responsibility of the execution of the Plan, and the coordination of the assistance to Central and Local public administration bodies in the implementation of the Plan.</p><p>In March 2019, the Minister for Simplification and Public Administration, Giulia Bongiorno, approved the <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/assets/pdf/2019-2021/Piano-Triennale-ICT-2019-2021.pdf">Three-Year Plan for Information Technology in public administration 2019 - 2021</a>. The new plan foresees actions to accelerate the transition to digital administrations and local entities and to empower citizens and businesses in being active protagonists of innovation.</p><p>The Three-Year Plan 2019-2021 outlines the actions needed to promote the digital transformation of the public sector, moving in the same direction defined by the 2017-2019 Plan. In particular, the new plan:</p><ul><li>Supports the inclusive path of digital growth of national and local governments with greater involvement of the key actors for the digital transition;</li><li>Defines the fundamental architectural principles, the interoperability rules of national infrastructures, and the cooperation model between different ecosystems and platforms;</li><li>Facilitates the relationship between public administrations and the market, also involving private actors in the development of integrated and interoperable services;</li><li>Introduces a novel perspective to understand the digital transformation, with a particular focus in identifying the areas of intervention and the impact on the main actors (citizens, businesses and public administrations).</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Designers Italia</p><p><a href="https://developers.italia.it/en/designers/">Designers Italia</a> calls upon the world of design, both inside and outside the public administration to strengthen the role of design thinking in the planning of digital public services.</p><p>Digital technologies are increasingly important to improve services and reduce costs. Designers Italia is a meeting point between people and technology with the aim of designing simple and citizen-friendly services.</p><p>Designers Italia - a national innovation project launched in June 2017 by the Agency for Digital Italy (AgID) and the Digital Transformation Team - is the benchmark for public administration design: guides, tools and a forum to foster collaboration between designers and to strengthen the role of design in developing public services.</p><p>The main objectives of this project are:</p><ul><li>To seek to understand citizens’ needs across the complexity of situations, needs, and moods in which they live while interacting with the PA;</li><li>To include the people’s point of view in the process of designing and choosing technologies for public digital services;</li><li>To work hard to make technology simpler, through a process of continuous improvement;</li><li>To help people understand the new digital tools and give them ways to familiarise themselves with changes.</li></ul><p>Designers Italia’s website contains several sections: Service design, Content design, User interface, User research, Projects, Blog and some discussion spaces on "Read the docs" and "Discourse" to contribute to the drafting of texts and to exchange views freely, as well a channel on “Behance”, where mainly web designers can share their projects.</p><p>Within the Projects section there are Design Guidelines for Public Administration Web Services, that include design and content rules for central and local public administration websites.</p><p>In 2016, the guidelines for the websites of local administrations, and the service design guidelines for designing &amp; creating digital public services were published. This project was the precursor of Designers.</p><p>Designers Italia contains all public administration Design Systems: shared resources for designing, implementing, and improving digital services through varied design tools like fora, guides and checklists. Designers Italia provides for the first time a User Interface (UI) Kit, an online library made available to designers who design public services; it contains interface components needed to create prototypes and applications for citizens.</p><p>The site is first and foremost a community of practices to strengthen skills, to encourage networking, and to facilitate the encounter between supply and demand. On the site, people can talk about concrete projects that can synchronise the country’s top priorities. The government can compare best practices, thanks to a forum with sections dedicated to service design, user research, content design and user interface design. In each area the government publishes kits, which are a set of tools available to everyone: guides, checklists and templates, prototyping tools, and open source code to create digital services without ever having to “reinvent the wheel”.</p><p>Designers Italia is a different and unique innovation due to the model of involvement of stakeholders, but even more generally citizens, thanks to the creation of the forum and the use of Behance. This allows private designers to contribute with their knowledge and experience to the implementation of design guidelines.</p><p>Designers Italia is heading in the direction of the creation of a real &amp; proper “design system” of the PA.</p><p>The design system offered intends to:</p><ul><li>Affirm shared standards. The community serves to improve these standards and to evolve them through the sharing of experiences: for this reason, there is a forum with several discussion threads and a blog that presents study cases and trends in design. All people involved in design within the public administration are able to come forward and contribute;</li><li>Foster dialogue between external professionals and the world of public administration. Thus, the project devotes space to information and operating tools on how to organise and participate in a public procurement. All professionals interested in working to improve public services are invited to participate;</li><li>Leverage common solutions, such as the <em>PagoPA</em> payment system, in order to initiate a process of continuous improvement and encourage adoption by as many administrations as possible;</li><li>Create site and service templates, and for that designers launched pilot projects in different areas (for example municipalities) and then started a process that will allow the community to generalise the solutions identified and thus, to make them available to others.</li></ul><p>Public administrations have both the capacity to either acquire the methodology and knowledge offered by Designers to build their own services internally (internal resources or in-house service providers) and/or rely on the guidelines to design competitions and public procurement for external supplies. Guidelines are always updated thanks to the feedback of the community, becoming a living space for a constant and democratic debate.</p><p>In March 2019, the national <a href="https://designers.italia.it/guide">guidelines and related</a> toolkits for designing public administrations’ web services were updated. </p><p>In addition, graphic components were provided to developers and designers through the new <a href="https://designers.italia.it/kit/ui-kit/">UI toolkit</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Transformation Advancement</p><p>Through the <a href="https://avanzamentodigitale.italia.it/it">Digital Transformation Advancement website</a>, citizens can control the state of the art of the Italian Digital Growth projects managed by the Agency for Digital Italy.

The Cloud Strategy also aims to qualify services and cloud infrastructures according to specific parameters of security and reliability suitable for the needs of the public administrations, in accordance with the following principles:</p><ul><li>Improvement of services’ level, accessibility, usability and security;</li><li>Interoperability of services within the cloud model of the public administrations;</li><li>Reduction of the risk of "vendor lock-in", i.e. creation of a dependency relationship with the service provider;</li><li>Requalification of the offer, expansion and diversification of the suppliers' market;</li><li>Resilience, scalability, "reversibility" and data protection;</li><li>Opening up of the market to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</li></ul><p>The adoption of the cloud infrastructure allows, in fact, to improve the operational efficiency of ICT systems, to achieve significant cost reductions, to make easier and cheaper to update software, to improve security and data protection and to speed up the delivery of services to citizens and businesses.</p><p>The cloud strategy outlined by AgID provides the prerequisites needed by public and private entities to provide cloud infrastructures and services to the public administration, so that the latter can adopt homogeneous cloud computing services and infrastructures that meet high standards of security, efficiency and reliability, in line with the provisions of <a href="https://cloud-pa.readthedocs.io/it/latest/">circulars AgID no.2 and no. 3 of April 9 2018</a>.</p><p>AgID has outlined the compliance requirements for security, performance and scalability, interoperability, portability, as well as the ones related to the organisational and legislative aspects. In particular, Italian public administrations are looking for:</p><ul><li>Cloud service providers: <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/it/infrastrutture/cloud-pa/qualificazione-saas">Saas services</a> (software as a service), Iaas services (Infrastructure as a service) and Paas (Platform as a service).</li><li>Cloud Infrastructure providers: <a href="https://cloud.italia.it/projects/cloud-italia-circolari/it/latest/circolari/CSP/index.html">Cloud Service Providers</a>, <a href="https://cloud.italia.it/projects/cloud-italia-docs/it/latest/cloud-della-pa.html#cloud-spc-lotto-1-community-cloud">Cloud SPC 1</a> -, <a href="https://cloud.italia.it/projects/cloud-italia-docs/it/latest/cloud-della-pa.html#poli-strategici-nazionali-private-cloud">National Strategic Poles</a>.</li></ul><p>Providers who meet the quality requirements will then be able to enter the Cloud Services Catalogue for public administrations, already available from July 2018. On this platform, all public administrations will have the opportunity to find out about the infrastructures and services available to guide their purchasing choices. From 1 April 2019, public administrations could acquire infrastructures and solutions through the Cloud Catalogue.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Third Open Government Partnership (OGP) Action Plan</p><p>Italy published its <a href="http://open.gov.it/terzo-piano-dazione-nazionale/">third OGP Action Plan</a>, covering the period 2016-2018, the result of a joint effort of more than 20 public administrations and the First National Forum on Open Government, which was attended by more than 60 organisations (universities, research centres, consumers’ associations and trade associations).</p><p>The central themes of the Plan are Open data and Transparency, Participation and Accountability, Digital Citizenship and Innovation. </p><p>With this new Plan the Italian Government wants to strongly relaunch its commitment on the Open Government, transparency, digital citizenship, participation and accountability which are also the fundamental objectives of the public administration Reform.</p><p>The <a href="http://open.gov.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016-10-07-3rd-NAP-Italy-English-version.pdf">new plan</a> was published in September 2016.</p><p>The Plan contained 34 actions divided into the three thematic areas:</p><ul><li>Open data and transparency (12 actions)</li><li>Participation and accountability (16 actions)</li><li>Digital Citizenship and Innovation (six actions) </li></ul><p>The Plan included actions that enabled the country to further open up, in line with OGP values of access to the public sector, civic participation, accountability and digitalisation of public administration.</p><p>After the adoption of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), part of the reform of public administration, the Government worked to ensure the right of civic access and monitor its implementation.</p><p>Among the first countries to adhere to the Charter of the International Open on the project, Italy today is equipped with a new strategy on open data in the public administration in order to give priority to requests that come from civil society, improving the quality and availability of information, enhancing transparency and promoting the reuse of published data.</p><p>With the third Action Plan Italy gives continuity to different projects like <em>Soldipubbici, OpenCoesione, ItaliaSicura</em> and <em>Opencantieri</em>, strengthening them and launching other initiatives on transparency in Government investment.</p><p>Furthermore, the Plan includes the participation of local administration: municipal and regional authorities are engaged in projects relevant to the prevention of corruption and protection of digital rights.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>SPID – Public System of Digital Identity</p><p><a href="https://www.spid.gov.it/">SPID</a>, the Public Digital Identity System, is the solution that allows users to access all the online services of the Public Administration with a single digital identity (username and password) that can be used by computers, tablets and smartphones. Its usage is becoming commonly accepted among public administrations and citizens: in 2019 more than 4 000 public administrations and more than 4 million citizens decided to adopt it. </p><p>SPID is rapidly evolving and AgID is currently working on different regulations to extend the use of SPID to physical persons on behalf of legal entities. It would make it possible to replicate the effect of an authenticated signature. The introduction of OpenID Connect technology to complement the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) technology currently in use, will reduce the burden to authenticate the subjects requesting the SPID.</p><p>As for the eID, the dissemination of electronic identity cards made possible the initiation of the process of notification of the eID in itself pursuant to art. 9 of the eIDAS Regulation, which was fully implemented in the first half of 2019.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic ID card</p><p>AgID started the process to integrate the Italian Electronic ID card to be used within public administrations of the Member States.</p><p>Public consultations to define the guidelines to integrate the use of electronic ID cards for professional usage were concluded.

The goal was to increase the responsiveness and efficiency of the cybersecurity systems of public administrations to prevent the occurrence of events such as accidents or hostile actions aimed at compromising normal provision of service. The first step was the drafting of the Guidelines for ICT Security of Public Administrations and its reference within the Minimum ICT Security Measures for Public Administrations document, published in 2016. More recently, as part of the programme for the implementation of the Digital Agenda, AgID launched the Italia Login project through which AgID aims at creating an integrated environment, from the level of infrastructure to that of applications, standards and norms, as a basis for the development and delivery of public administration services for citizens and businesses.</p><p>Acknowledging the importance of the impact of cyber-attacks to which public administrations may be exposed, in 2018 a risk management methodology was designed and developed, starting from the ones already applied in the private and public sector, both nationally and internationally. The main characteristics are the following:</p><ul><li>To be applied to all public administrations, which differ in size, technological complexity and typologies of services delivered to businesses, citizens and other public entities;</li><li>To be supported by an application tool that can be used by all public administrations and integrated with other central IT infrastructures such as "Servizi.Gov.it".</li></ul><p>Starting from the second half of 2018, PAC and PAL were involved in the experimentation of the cyber risk self-assessment tool developed by AgID and available on <a href="https://www.sicurezzait.gov.it"><em>SicurezzaIT</em></a>.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base <a href="https://www.sicurezzait.gov.it">registries</a></h3><p class="subtitle">Base RegistriesAccording to the three-year-plan (<a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.readthedocs.io/it/latest/doc/04_infrastrutture-immateriali.html#dati-della-pubblica-amministrazione"><em>Piano Triennale</em></a>), Italy implemented controlled vocabularies and metadata plan for 17 Base Registries.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">Framework agreement with the Ugo Bordoni Foundation</p><p>In February 2018, AgID signed a framework agreement with the Ugo Bordoni Foundation, which provided support for the management and implementation of procedures and specifications for Pre-Commercial Procurement (PCP) contracts aimed at the conclusion of R&amp;D contracts.</p><p class="subtitle">Memorandum of Understanding Between AgID, the Campania Region and Soresa</p><p>In May 2018, a Memorandum of Understanding between AgID, the Campania Region and Soresa was agreed to promote the use of innovation and pre-commercial procurement, particularly in the digital health and ICT sectors.</p><p class="subtitle">Collaboration Agreement Between AgID and the Agency for Territorial Cohesion</p><p>In June 2018, a Collaboration agreement between AgID and the Agency for Territorial Cohesion was agreed for the implementation of the 2014-2020 Community Programme and, in particular, the coordination of the actions provided for the stimulation of public demand for innovation and the promotion of pre-commercial public procurement.</p><p class="subtitle">Institute for Innovation and Transparency of Procurement and Environmental Compatibility</p><p>In September 2018, the Memorandum of Understanding with the Conference of Regions and Autonomous Provinces, <em>Confindustria</em> and Ithaca (Institute for Innovation and Transparency of Procurement and Environmental Compatibility) was agreed.

Cooperation between the public and the private sectors plays a core role in the path toward mutually recognised national systems.</p><p>In April 2019, there were 4 126 393 SPID identity provided, nine active digital identity managers, and 4 000 active administrations.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic ID Card</p><p>The Italian electronic ID card (CIE) project was launched in 2001. After two phases of testing, it was rolled out across the country and distributed to citizens older than 15. In December 2018, AgID started the notification process to all Member States in an attempt to make the CIEs usable within all the European Public Administrations, as it is for the SPID. This process was finalised in the first half of 2019. The Italian electronic ID card is complementary to SPID.</p><p>The Italian eID card comprises a microchip, an optical memory and an ICAO machine readable zone for the use of the card as a travel document. It contains a set of personal data, including the holder's fiscal code, blood group and fingerprint scans. The personal data, biometric key and digital signature are only stored on the card. In accordance with data protection legislation, this data is not kept on any central database and can only be released and used if the holder gives his/her permission by inserting a PIN code. The cardholder’s fingerprint template is stored in both the microchip and the optical memory. The microchip makes online identification possible and enables transactions between citizens and providers, including ePayments. </p><p>From April 2017 to December 2018, all Italian municipalities activated the system of CIE. Thanks to CIE, Italian citizens can travel within the EU and access online services provided by Italian public administration.</p><p class="subtitle">Certified Electronic Mail (PEC)</p><p>In 2005, <a href="http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/decreti/dpr068_05.pdf">Decree (DPR) no. 68</a> defined the characteristics of a new electronic delivery service (<a href="http://www.openpec.org/eng/index.shtml"><em>Posta Elettronica Certificata - PEC</em></a>), granting it legal value.</p><p>PEC ensured the recognition of the sender; the integrity of a sent message (by digital signature); the absence of delivery refusal; the matching between the delivery receipt; and the message sent by the user.</p><p>The eGovernment Code introduced the PEC use in government processes. Public administrations were requested to set up and publish at least one PEC address.</p><p class="subtitle">National Services Card (CNS)</p><p>In order to enable citizens to securely access eGovernment services even before the widespread dissemination of electronic ID cards, the Italian Government developed the <a href="http://www.progettocns.it/index.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">National Services Card</a> (CNS). It was a smart card that allowed for the secured identification of citizens online. The card's only difference from the eID card was that the CNS lacks its additional security elements, such as the laser band, the holograms, etc, therefore not constituting a 'proof of identity' or a travel document.</p><p>The card was used to sign electronic documents and due to its flexibility in Administration-to-Citizen (A2C) services, both at national and local levels.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Passport (ePass)</p><p>Since 2009, Italy has been gradually entering phase II of the implementation of the European Union's <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R2252:EN:HTML">Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004</a> of 13 December 2004, on 'standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States'. Already containing the holder's facial image, the <a href="https://www.passaportonline.poliziadistato.it/">current version of the passport</a> also contains fingerprints. The police stations and headquarters collect the fingerprints contained in the document and store them in encrypted mode on an invisible microchip. Once the passport is issued, the fingerprints are deleted from the central archive and remain solely on the electronic passport. The new passport is hence deemed more secure with regard to counterfeiting. It becomes a primary identification tool since fingerprints are unique and unrepeatable. The fingerprints are collected for all passports' applicants who are above 12 years old.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Innovative Procurement Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://appaltinnovativi.gov.it/">Innovative Procurement Portal</a> was created according to the provisions of action line 75 of Chapter 10 of the Three-Year Plan for Information Technology in Public Administration 2019-2021 with the aim of promoting the use of innovation contracts, to support Italian public administrations in carrying out procurement procedures, and to match the supply and demand of innovative solutions. It does this by encouraging effective collaborations between public administrations, companies and research institutions, in line with the provisions of the Italian Digital Agenda.</p><p>The portal offers a wide selection of the procedures set up by the Italian PPAAs, also within the framework of national programmes, and is designed to accommodate the entire path of innovation, from the emergence of needs to the implementation of the purchase.

Consip's mission is to develop and manage innovative ICT projects for the Ministry of Economy and Finance and to support the Italian Public Administration in the development and use of electronic procurement tools.</p><p>The Portal is a fully functional eProcurement platform aimed at improving public procurement efficiency. The platform facilitates the use of the main tools for public eProcurement: framework agreements, online auctions, dynamic purchasing systems and an electronic marketplace (MEPA). Furthermore, the platform provides all kinds of information on eProcurement activities, demo and training sessions both to buyers and sellers, as well as an eCatalogue through which direct orders or requests for quotation to all or part of the registered and qualified suppliers are issued. Since 1 July 2007, the use of the Public Administration eMarketplace (MEPA) has been mandatory for all central administrations for the purchase of goods and services valued below the EU threshold.
