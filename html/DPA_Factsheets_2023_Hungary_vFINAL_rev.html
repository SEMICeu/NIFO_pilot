The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><img src="img/32-519.x-emf" alt="32-519.x-emf" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Hungary in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><img src="img/32-536.x-emf" alt="32-536.x-emf" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Hungary’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, with all principles falling within the EU average for which it scored 3. It is worth mentioning the performance of Principle 10 (Administrative simplification) implementation, which increased from a score of 3 to 4 in 2022. The areas for improvement are concentrated in Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 7 (Inclusion and accessibility), 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) <a id="_Hlk75095696"></a>for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the alignment and tailoring of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies with the EIF (Principle 1 – Recommendation 1), the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14), the availability of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16) and the implementation of evaluation mechanisms to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of interoperable solutions (Principle 12 – Recommendation 19) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><img src="img/32-544.x-emf" alt="32-544.x-emf" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Hungarian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall high performance with a score of 4, with the exception of the area of interoperability governance, for which Hungary scored 3. This score could be particularly improved with the existence of defined processes for the selection and adoption of standards and specifications (Recommendation 21), the use of a structured, transparent, objective and common approach for the assessment and selection of standards and specifications (Recommendation 22) and the consultation of relevant catalogues for standards, specifications and guidelines at the national and EU level (Recommendation 23) by Hungary.</p><img src="img/32-553.x-emf" alt="32-553.x-emf" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Hungary’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model, internal information sources and services, base registries and open data. It is worth mentioning that the implementation of the recommendations relating to security and privacy has led to the score moving from 3 to 4 in 2022. However, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to the catalogues, external information sources services. In particular, putting in place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions (Catalogues - Recommendation 44) as well as the lack of use of external information sources and services while developing European public services (External information and services – Recommendation 45).</p><img src="img/32-562.x-emf" alt="32-562.x-emf" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Hungary concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at upper-middle performance of the country in 16 indicators. Particularly, Hungary has a high performance with the maximum score of four in Principle 8 and 11 (i.e. Security and privacy, Preservation of information) as well as Legal interoperability and Open Data (i.e. Recommendation 27, 41 and 43). However, Hungary has still margin for improvement. For instance, efforts could focus on the reuse and share solutions, and cooperate in the development of joint solutions when implementing European public services (i.e. Recommendation 6) and on simplifying processes and use digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users’ requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens.

The strategy builds on the results of the previous National Infocommunication Strategy 2014‑2020 and the Digital Success Programme 2.0.</p><p>Aiming to develop the economy, education, innovation and research, and public administration, the strategy is based on four pillars and the following focus areas:</p><ul><li>Digital infrastructure: promote the development of gigabit-capable networks and 5G, expand the digital infrastructures for schools and higher education institutions, ensure the continued development of the National Telecommunication Backbone Network, and increase the supercomputing capacity for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), research networks and public institutions;</li><li>Digital skills: create programmes for digital competency, increase the number and capacity of information technology (IT) professionals and support the learning of digital skills in education;</li><li>Digital economy: increase the digital reach and use of SMEs, develop digital start-up businesses, create support programmes for the information and communication technology (ICT) industry and its development, and utilise data assets of the government for economic purposes; and</li><li>Digital State: support the digital development of both central and local, and cross-border public administration with user-friendly systems and customer-centric services, develop smart towns and smart areas, and increase electronic services.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">National Digital Citizen Programme 2022–2026</p><img src="img/32-582.png" alt="32-582.png" /><p>The government adopted the <a href="https://dmu.gov.hu/documents/prod/DMU_nemzeti_digitalis_allampolgarsag_program_2022.pdf">National Digital Citizen Programme 2022–2026</a> in December 2022 as a sectoral strategic programme introducing the ‘digital citizen’ concept. This concept aims to reinterpret the relationship between the State and the citizen based on the digital identity initiative launched by the EU, through basic services (eID, ePost, eDocuments and ePayment) and user-friendly channels operating on a single platform, with a ‘mobile first’ approach.</p><p>One of the most important basic services is Mia Chatbot easy-to-use digital identification service, which can support many complex administration processes. In this context, a new mobile application will be developed and implemented for electronic identification (eID), in accordance with the legal provisions of the successor regulation of the Regulation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation), which will establish the framework for a European digital identity. With the help of the new mobile wallet to be developed, citizens can log in to the digital citizen platform and use the main digital public services according to the life events covered.</p><p>In accordance with EU requirements, the application will be able to receive and store user data, with an appropriate level of encryption. Its functions include mutual authentication for external (public or private) parties, the sharing of designated data and the creation of authentic eSignatures. The application will provide the above-mentioned functions on a simple, user-friendly interface and will be compatible with the systems of other (including foreign) stakeholders. According to the schedule of the National Digital Citizenship Programme, by 2026 citizens will be able to use all necessary digital public services online, on their mobile devices.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><img src="img/32-589.png" alt="32-589.png" /><p class="subtitle">National Digitalisation Strategy 2022–2030</p><p>The <a href="https://cdn.kormany.hu/uploads/document/6/60/602/60242669c9f12756a2b104f8295b866a8bb8f684.pdf">National Digitalisation Strategy 2022–2030</a> presents increased interoperability as one of the requirements for the fourth pillar on the development of a digital State. More specifically, it identifies the need to establish a data-based administration in the country, with interoperable data connections between administrative services on different levels (local, national and European) and aspects (legal, organisational, semantic and technical).</p><p>In addition to technology neutrality and IT security requirements, a development based on software with open-source codes needs to be encouraged. The necessary legislative framework to that end was established according to the National Infocommunication Strategy 2014–2020 with the adoption of <a href="http://njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=193173">Act No. CCXXII of 2015 on the General Rules for Electronic Administration and Trust Services</a> (hereinafter, the eAdministration Act).

The 2013 amendment of the PSI Directive was then implemented by the deadline of 2015 (Act No. XCVI of 2015), with the Hungarian implementation going beyond the provisions of the PSI Directive in some aspects. The Public Data Act was subsequently modified in 2022 to implement the Open Data Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/1024), ensuring full harmonisation with EU law in this respect.</p><p>Furthermore, the new <a href="https://ai-hungary.com/api/v1/companies/15/files/137203/view">Strategy on Artificial Intelligence 2020–2030</a> was adopted, including a dedicated part on data policy and data reuse which calls for a proper institutional background and a one‑way‑access data portal. Within the framework of the strategy, the national open data portal has been launched and the National Data Asset Management Agency (<em>Nemzeti Adatvagyon Ügynökség,</em> NAVÜ) has been established with the main purpose of facilitating and coordinating the reuse of public sector data among public sector bodies. The Agency also provides analysis and information services to public sector bodies.

The Hungarian eIDAS node’s development has been finished and the bilateral tests conducted with Member States should be completed by the first half of 2023. Once this process is ended, it should be possible to publish eIDAS identification in the Central Authentication Agent service and to put the eIDAS identification option into operation in the Central Authentication Agent for the connected sector-specific systems. The latter may also need to examine their administrative processes and implement the necessary developments to be able to accept eIDAS identification.</p><p>In January 2023, the number of valid, chip-containing eID cards issued since the launch in January 2016 surpassed 6.6 million and the number of Client Gate accounts exceeded 5.5 million.</p><h3>Security Aspects</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>The <a href="https://nki.gov.hu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Strategy-for-the-security-of-network-and-information-systems-in-Hungary.pdf">Cybersecurity Strategy</a> of Hungary was adopted at the end of December 2018 (1838/2018 (XII 28)) by governmental resolution, aiming to establish a free, safe, innovative and competitive cyberspace, increase Hungary’s competitiveness, introduce innovations and new technologies in a secure manner, and adapt them to the digitalised public administration, government and economy.

It will contribute to better policy making and internal management within the public administration, by providing more secure, more economic and easily scalable services that can further improve the efficiency of the functioning of the public sector.</p><p>As part of this goal, the Digital Hungary Agency aims to establish a data centre in Hungary in collaboration with an international cloud service provider, where a dedicated server space would be created for the Hungarian digital public service systems. Such a cooperation between the public and the private sector would be mutually beneficial: as in the region at the moment only one leading cloud provider has a data centre (in Vienna), this could result in potential gains for international cloud providers, while keeping the costs lower for the State budget.</p><p>On a short term, a mixed cloud service model is planned, based on a close cooperation between a cloud service provider and the government’s own cloud service offered on the basis of the already existing Government Data Centre. On a longer term, a multi-cloud model is envisioned, where more international cloud operators become part of this cooperation. </p><p>According to the classification of data, non-classified data can be stored in the public cloud in an encrypted form, while classified data remain in the local Government Data Centre. Therefore, the Government Data Centre also has to be further developed so that it can support systems that cannot be channelled into the international cloud service, with modern functions.</p><p>In line with the above-mentioned goals, new eGovernment applications and systems need to be developed in a way that is fully optimised for the cloud environment.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing</h3><img src="img/32-626.png" alt="32-626.png" /><p class="subtitle">High Performance Computing Infrastructure and Ecosystem</p><p>Government Decision 1422/2020 (VII 23) set the direction for the development of the Hungarian high performance computing (HPC) ecosystem. It also appointed KIFÜ as the operator of the National HPC Competence Centre, and provided EUR 1.36 million for the infrastructure and EUR 0.66 million for the National HPC Competence Centre operation for 2022.</p><p>In the framework of the Economic Development and Innovation Operational Programme (GINOP), KIFÜ procured and installed a new 5-PetaFlops HPC called ‘Komondor’, which was put into operation in December 2022 at the premises of the Debrecen University. The project, with an overall budget amounting to EUR 16.5 million, was finalised in the first quarter of 2023. The ‘Komondor’ HPC is built with modern, energy-efficient technologies. As a result, despite the large computing power, the electricity need is just over 300 kW. In addition, the machine uses a hot water-cooling solution, enabling the recycling of the waste heat produced by the machine. </p><p>Currently, together with the Komondor, KIFÜ operates three different HPCs with an overall capacity of 5.4 PetaFlops, offering specialized AI, big data, graphics programming unit (GPU) and central processing unit (CPU) partitions. The main clients of KIFÜ’s HPCs are educational and research institutes, as well as SMEs.</p><p>Hungary is among the founding States of the EuroHPC joint undertaking (JU). Together with the EuroHPC JU, KIFÜ is working on a project aimed at building and hosting in Hungary the 20‑PetaFlops HPC called ‘Levente’ by 2025 at the latest. In parallel, in cooperation with the German partners Jülich Research Centre and ParTec AG, work has started towards extending ‘Levente’ with a quantum module. The demanding and ambitious Hungarian plans towards research and implementation of a quantum computing module into the modular structure of the future ‘Levente’ HPC has also resulted in an ambitious German-Hungarian 4-party framework agreement. In addition to quantum development, it is aimed at HPC software and parallel algorithm development work, as well as HPC application development for analysing and modelling challenging problems such as the energy crisis and climate change, increasing the quality of meteorological services, supporting the Industry 4.0 and 5.0, etc. </p><p>KIFÜ also successfully took part in the action called ‘National Competence Centres in the Framework of EuroHPC’, which ended in December 2022. The overall budget of the action was EUR 2 million, with 50% of the funds provided by the EuroHPC call and 50% by the national budget. Based on the results of this action, KIFÜ started the preparations for participating in EuroCC 2, which starts in the first quarter of 2023. </p><p>As part of the EuroHPC launched activities, the National HPC Competence Centre has joined the consortium of the European Competence Centres. The yearly budget of the National HPC Competence Centre amounts to EUR 1 million, of which 50% is covered by EuroHPC support and 50% by national financing.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity </h3><img src="img/32-632.png" alt="32-632.png" /><p class="subtitle">Superfast Broadband Programme</p><p>The Hungarian government launched the Superfast Broadband Programme in 2015.

The service provides integrated back-office systems (financial management software, municipal tax software, document management software, industrial and commercial management software, property cadastre, eAdministration web portal and online form management) for the daily tasks of municipalities, as well as client-side eGovernment services, on a single platform for 99% of all municipalities.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">Central Authentication Agent In January 2016, a new central identification solution, the <a href="https://mo.hu/szuf_fooldal">Central Authentication Agent</a>, was launched, supporting the use of different electronic identification and authentication services, including the Client Gate, the Client Gate+, the national eID card, the partial code telephone authentication and the video-based facial recognition authentication. According to the schedule, eIDAS authentication will be made available via the service in 2023.Client Gate </p><p>A comprehensive central identification solution, called <a href="https://ugyfelkapu.magyarorszag.hu/">Client Gate</a> (<em>Ügyfélkapu</em>), has been available in Hungary since April 2005 for the identification of citizens for electronic transactions between public authorities and citizens. The Client Gate account can be obtained either in person in one of the government one-stop-shops or online with the use of the national eID card. Client Gate is capable of identifying citizens for any public authority that connects to it. At the end of 2022 the number of Client Gate accounts in use surpassed 5.5 million, with an 8% increase compared to the previous year.</p><p class="subtitle">Client Gate+ </p><img src="img/32-662.png" alt="32-662.png" /><p>The Client Gate+ (<em>Ügyfélkapu</em>+) service is a further developed version of the popular Client Gate eID service. Client Gate+ provides a two-factor authentication, where the first factor are the Client Gate username and password, and the second factor is a one-time password generated by an authenticator application that can be installed on a mobile device. Client Gate+ was launched on 3 June 2022.</p><p class="subtitle">National eID card Since February 2018 eServices already integrated with the Central Authentication Agent service can be accessed with the use of the <a href="https://eszemelyi.hu/">Hungarian eID card</a> (<em>eSzemélyi</em>) as well, by relaying on a Near Field Communication (NFC) chip reader or an Android smartphone with such functionality. In January 2023, the number of valid eID cards issued reached 6.6 million. Video-based facial recognition authentication </p><img src="img/32-668.png" alt="32-668.png" /><p>The video-based facial recognition (VKTA) electronic identification service was introduced on 1 February 2021. The VKTA is an end-to-end identification service based on biometry through video means, providing citizens with the necessary registration and identification for eAdministration. The solution is also capable of taking the photographs or signature images required for applying for documents, a function which is used e.g. in the new service for the issuance of driver’s licenses (see below in relation to its blockchain technology).</p><p class="subtitle">eIDAS authentication</p><img src="img/32-675.png" alt="32-675.png" /><p>The Hungarian eIDAS node’s development has been finished and the bilateral tests conducted with Member States should have been be finalised by 31 March 2023. Once this process is ended, it should be possible to publish eIDAS identification in the Central Authentication Agent service and to put the eIDAS identification option into operation in the Central Authentication Agent for the connected sector-specific systems during this year.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Public Procurement Legislation</p><p>Public procurement and electronic procurement issues are controlled and managed by one Ministry in Hungary. The <a href="https://kozbeszerzes.hu/torveny/act-cxliii-of-2015-on-public-procurement/">Public Procurement Act </a>and its <a href="https://kozbeszerzes.hu/cikkek/kozbeszerzesi-torveny-es-kapcsolodo-jogszabalyok">implementing decrees</a> are prepared by the Office of the Prime Minister, which is also responsible for the eProcurement policy. The monitoring of public procurement is carried out by the Office of the Prime Minister (in procurement procedures financed both by domestic budget and EU funds) and the Public Procurement Authority, subordinated to the Parliament (monitoring of contract and award notices, etc.).</p><p class="subtitle">System for eProcurement Infrastructure</p><p>The use of a single national eProcurement solution, the <a href="https://ekr.gov.hu/">EKR</a>, is mandated by the Public Procurement Act for all contracting authorities and contracting entities in public procurement procedures both below and above EU public procurement thresholds. The EKR used to be operated by <a href="https://ujvilag.gov.hu/">NEKSZT Ltd.</a>, a State-owned company under the control of the Office of the Prime Minister. The new operator of the EKR solution is now <a href="https://ujvilag.gov.hu/">Ujvilag</a>.</p><p>The EKR was developed in late 2017 and from 1 January to 14 April 2018 was used on a voluntary basis. However, eProcurement through the EKR has become compulsory for all contracting authorities since 15 April 2018 (though central purchasing bodies may partially use their own platforms). The paper-based administration of procurements has ceased since then.</p><p class="subtitle">Online Invoice System </p><p>Since July 2018 <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/">eInvoicing</a> has become obligatory for transactions between domestic taxpayers including an output VAT of more than HUF 100 000 (approximately EUR 320). In July 2020, the amount of output VAT was reduced to HUF 0, with all invoices issued between domestic taxpayers being exchanged through the available system. </p><p>In January 2021, the obligation of sending invoice data was extended to all kinds of invoices issued by domestic taxpayers, but taxpayers had an additional three months to prepare themselves for fulfilling the obligation without any sanction. For this purpose, the National Tax and Customs Administration (NTCA) has developed and launched a central <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/home">Online Invoice System</a> connected to the financial management software or the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system of businesses via machine‑to‑machine interface. In case of paper invoices, data must be provided manually using the online service within five days, also encouraging businesses to turn to the use of eInvoicing. The NTCA also provides an online invoicing solution free of charge, mainly for SMEs, that can be used to issue eInvoices as well as paper invoices, and automatically sends the invoice data to the NTCA, regardless of the amount of output VAT. To promote and encourage eInvoicing and digital administration, in May 2020 this free online invoicing programme was made available through a mobile app, also helping to reduce administrative burdens. </p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing in Public Procurement</p><p>To comply with Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement, since 18 April 2019 the Public Procurement Act has been requiring contracting authorities to receive and process invoices complying with the relevant European standard. The Public Procurement Act does not clarify further the means to process invoices, leaving it to the contracting authorities to choose the method of transmission and processing.</p><p>A so-called eInvoicing module is also available in the EKR, enabling to verify whether an invoice complies with the European standard EN 16931-1:2017 and the syntax list published by the European Commission in the Official Journal of the EU. The eInvoicing module can help contracting authorities to decide whether they have a legal obligation to receive and process a specific invoice or not.</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Payment and Settlement System</p><p><a href="https://www.nisz.hu/hu/efer-â-elektronikus-fizetÃ©si-Ã©s-elszÃ¡molÃ¡si-rendszer">NISZ Zrt</a>., as provider of the Electronic Payment and Settlement System (EFER), offers an electronic payment service for both electronic and traditional paper-based procedures. EFER is a central electronic payment service (with an associated settlement system) that allows customers to fulfil their payment obligations to electronic administration bodies using a bank card, a virtual bank card or an internet bank. Furthermore, it allows for a single transaction to be used to pay fees related to a given case but payable on a different basis, as well as for the paid amount to be cleared to the target accounts. </p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2>Cross-border infrastructures</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Personal Data and Address Registry</p><p>As the most important base registry, the <a href="https://www.nyilvantarto.hu/hu/adatszolgaltatas_szemelyi">Personal Data and Address Registry</a>, maintained by the Ministry of the Interior, is a public official registry that contains and certifies the personal data and notification addresses specified by law for registered citizens, as well as any changes thereto. The role of the registry is to collect and manage the data and changes specified in Act LXVI of 1992 on the Registration of Citizens’ Personal Data and Addresses, to issue documents and to provide data on them to those entitled under the act. Data are provided to other eGovernment services via the KKSZB data exchange platform.</p><p class="subtitle">Client Settings Register</p><img src="img/32-681.png" alt="32-681.png" /><p>The <a href="https://rendelkezes.gov.hu/rny-public/">Client Settings Register</a> records the client’s provisions on powers and mandates for electronic administration and makes this information available to other entitled public bodies providing digital public services. A statement recorded in the register is effective in dealings with public bodies providing eAdministration services.

To protect personal data in line with the strict Hungarian privacy rules prohibiting the use of a single identification number for individuals, the Association Registry does not include any personal information or other sectoral ID, but uses encrypted contact codes instead.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Register of Registers</p><p>The <a href="https://euf.gov.hu/">EÜF</a>, in accordance with the eAdministration Act and the related implementing regulations, shall manage and publish the Register of Information Sources (based on the content of the information transfer rules submitted), and the List of Data and Document Titles. The purpose of the Register of Information Sources is to identify redundant administrative burdens in public services, as well as to enable citizens and other organisations to know what public administration organisation keeps what kind of records and under what procedure, and how to claim data. The <a href="https://euf.gov.hu/nyeny">Electronic Register of Registers (NyENy)</a> is a registration system where (i) information transfer rules can be prepared and recorded; and (ii) the Register of Information Sources, and the List of Data and Document Titles can be managed. The NyENy helps to develop the interpretation of standard definitions, to simplify the process of administration, to extend the recent information system techniques and technological solutions, and to guide clients (citizens or representatives of public services).</p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle">AI-assisted building block services</p><p>Following the regulatory measures supporting the uptake of AI-based solutions by the public sector mentioned above, the following three AI-assisted building block services developed by the Ministry of the Interior have become available for <a href="https://www.blockchainhungary.org/_files/ugd/b93087_035dadcc965e4f0ea6e1c4ee94b38009.pdf">public administration reuse</a>: the AI-assisted voice generator service (text-to-speech), the AI-assisted voice description service (speech-to-text) and the AI-assisted communication assistant (chatbot), a software solution capable of conducting conversation and interactive communication very similar to human dialogue in a collaborative manner automatically, with or without human intervention, through a machine self-learning process. All three AI-assisted services use deep learning to learn continuously in a supervised way. The new central AI-based building block services are offered from the Government Data Centre, thus ensuring the highest security requirements for closed electronic information systems, so that services used by the client will not be available to third parties.</p><p>For illustration, the AI-supported MIA Chatbot of the Government Hotline was introduced in May 2021 for responding to written inquiries using a combination of artificial and human intelligence. Based on the communication of customer service operators, the chatbot offers response options to operators and then, continuously learning from the accepted response suggestions, it can enter into fully automatic mode. The MIA Chatbot currently provides assistance to citizens in using the Client Gate service, the Company Gate eDelivery service for businesses. In 2022 the Government Hotline answered more than 600 000 customer questions via the MIA Chatbot service, of which 38% automatically, 60% semi-automatically (with the operator choosing from the options suggested by the bot) and only 2% by manual answering. The use of the MIA Chatbot is planned to be further expanded in 2023 by adding further services, with new functions. </p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><img src="img/32-686.png" alt="32-686.png" /><p class="subtitle">Blockchain Module </p><p>A blockchain module has been implemented to issue the first driver’s licenses through an automated service. The module deals with the management of the certification data, the verification of the conditions for the driver’s license and document issuance. The received exam data are handled in an irrevocable and irrefutable way by linking the received data packages to each other and authenticating them with a time stamp, depending on the person and the procedure. More in detail, the blockchain module:</p><ul><li>Processes the chronologically-chained certification data received, linking them to the person;</li><li>Based on the received data, makes an evaluation decision as to whether all the conditions for the driver’s license are met, i.e. whether the document issuance procedure can be initiated;</li><li>is capable of providing a snapshot of the entire history of the data container at a given moment in time, as well as transmitting only valid data; and</li><li>after the successful issuance of the driver’s license, closes the data containers and monitors the data retention period for data protection reasons.</li></ul><p>As another example, the Hungarian National Bank – as a key supporter of blockchain technology – developed in May 2022 a dedicated NFT platform based on a private blockchain.</p><h3>Big data </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Cloud computing</h3><p class="subtitle">Government Data Centre</p><p>Avoiding using external (public and hybrid) cloud services in the public administration is a key element of the Hungarian government’s IT policy. For this reason, the Hungarian government started to develop the <a href="https://nisz.hu/szolgaltatasok/informatika">Government Data Centre</a>. The Government Data Centre is a geo‑redundant data centre offering central IT infrastructure capable of providing a cloud‑based service environment for government, public administration and public services. The service provider of the Government Data Centre is the State-owned NISZ Zrt., designated by law and controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. As a result of last years’ development, the share of the cloud-enabled data centre capacity provided by NISZ Zrt. accounts for 24.6% of the total governmental server room infrastructure. More than 100 public administration systems have been set up and installed, and are running in the Government Data Centre.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-performance computing</h3><img src="img/32-691.png" alt="32-691.png" /><p class="subtitle">High Performance Computing Infrastructure and Ecosystem</p><p>As Hungary’s supercomputer infrastructure was underdeveloped (with a total capacity of less than 0.5 PetaFlops), the country was not able to serve the growing needs of research and development (R&amp;D), and industrial innovation. As a result, the Ministry of Innovation and Technology has started working to significantly improve the available national HPC capacity. </p><p>Hungary’s supercomputer infrastructure is now being expanded in accordance with the two‑phase development process defined by <a href="https://njt.hu/jogszabaly/2020-1422-30-22">Government Decree 1422/2020</a>. The first phase, aimed to increase Hungary’s capacity to 5 PetaFlops, was concluded by the end of 2022 and the 5‑PetaFlops HPC called ‘<a href="https://hpc.kifu.hu/hu/komondor">Komondor</a>’ has been in operation since January 2023 in the campus of the Debrecen University. The second phase is now under implementation, with the goal to build and operate a national HPC infrastructure of at least 20 PetaFlops by 2025.</p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity </h3><p class="subtitle">Superfast Broadband Programme</p><p>The Hungarian government launched the Superfast Broadband Programme in 2015. The original aim was to reach 100% broadband connectivity footprint, with minimum 30Mbps download speed, by the end of 2018. The programme has then continued beyond 2018, aiming at meeting higher bandwidth needs and including also the development of fibre optic backhaul connectivity, especially in rural areas. The programme includes the direct deployment of the State aid network and the operators' own developments coordinated by the Ministry.</p><p>The main results of the programme by the end of 2022 were the following:</p><ul><li>Deployment of 19 000 km of new fibre optic network;</li><li>Building of 3 000 km of new passive infrastructure (mainly cable ducts);</li><li>Covering of 87% of the new endpoints built under the programme with fibre‑to‑the‑home (FTTH);</li><li>EUR 178 million of direct State-aid (funded mainly by the EU); and</li><li>Total project funding of EUR 460 million (including also operators’ own financing).</li></ul><p>To promote and coordinate 5G developments the government has also established a non-profit organisation called 5G Coalition. This body includes the Ministry, mobile network operators, equipment vendors and leading IT firms, as well as universities and representatives of potential industrial leaders.</p><h3>GovTech </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><img src="img/32-696.png" alt="32-696.png" /><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p><h1><a id="_Toc140673930"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on Hungary’s responsible bodies for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-hungary">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474973"></a>National </h2><img src="img/32-701.png" alt="32-701.png" /><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474975"></a>Cabinet Office of the Prime Minister</p><p>According to Government Decree 182/2022 (V 24) on the Competences and Powers of the Members of the Government, the <a href="https://kormany.hu/miniszterelnoki-kabinetiroda/">Cabinet Office of the Prime Minister</a> is responsible for eGovernment, IT, harmonisation of eGovernment and IT development within the public sector, government IT infrastructure, electronic communications and audiovisual media.

provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad. In order to do so, Your Europe offers information on basic rights under EU law, but also on how these rights are implemented in each individual country (where information has been provided by the national authorities). Free email or telephone contact with EU assistance services, to get more personalised or detailed help and advice is also available.</p><p>Please note that, in most cases, the EU rights described in Your Europe apply to all EU member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and sometimes to Switzerland. Information on Your Europe is provided by the relevant departments of the European Commission and complemented by content provided by the authorities of every country it covers.

Indeed, enhanced interoperability will be necessary to unlock the potential of data use and reuse for improved public services, to enable cross-border collaboration, and to support the sector-specific policy goals set by the Commission for the future.</p><p>Interoperable Europe will lead the process of achieving these goals and creating a reinforced interoperability policy that will work for everyone.
