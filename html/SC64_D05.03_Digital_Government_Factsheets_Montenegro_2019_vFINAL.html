Digital Post refers to the possibility that governments communicate electronically-only with citizens or entrepreneurs through e.g. personal mailboxes or other digital mail solutions.</p><p>These top-level benchmarks are measured using a life-events (e.g. mystery shopping) approach.

The strategic approach in planning the development of an information system in health care is aimed at maximum use of information and communication technology potentials and routing activities of all stakeholders in the health system.

Furthermore, through the interoperability module, the Centre for Social Work becomes a one-stop shop where all documents are submitted for determining the acceptability of social benefits.  The system generates the so-called eSocial cards (property, social, employment status) of individual/family social profiles.</p><p>In this way, it is easier for users to learn their rights and reduce their costs related to the collection of a large number of supporting documents in paper form.</p><p>Also, the quality and efficiency of the work of the Centres for Social Work has been increased by directly downloading data from the information systems of other institutions.</p><p class="subtitle">Framework for Interoperability of the Montenegrin Health System</p><p>Although the provision of public services in almost all cases include data exchange between information systems, interoperability is a wider concept that includes the possibility of organizing joint work on commonly useful and commonly agreed goals.
