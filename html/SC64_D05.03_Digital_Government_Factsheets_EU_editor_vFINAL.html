These indicators are clustered within four main top-level benchmarks:</p><ul><li><strong>User Centricity</strong> – indicates to what extent (information about) a service is provided online and how this is perceived.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong> – indicates to what extent governments are transparent regarding: i) their own responsibilities and performance, ii) the process of service delivery and iii) personal data involved.</li><li><strong>Cross-Border Mobility</strong> – indicates to what extent EU citizens and businesses can use online services in another country.</li><li><strong>Key Enablers</strong> – indicates the extent to which four technical pre-conditions are available online. There are: Identification (eID), Electronic documents (eDocuments), Authoritative Sources, and Digital Post. Digital Post refers to the possibility that governments communicate electronically-only with citizens or entrepreneurs through e.g. personal mailboxes or other digital mail solutions.</li></ul><p>These top-level benchmarks are measured using a life-events (e.g. mystery shopping) approach. Eight life events are included in the overall eGovernment performance score. Four of these life events were measured in 2013, 2015 and 2017 and the other four were measured in 2012, 2014, 2016, and again in 2018. The life events measured in 2017 were Regular business operations, Moving, Owning and driving a car and Starting a small claims procedure. The life events measured in 2018 are Business start-up, Losing and finding a job, Family life and Studying.</p><img src="img/5-12.png" alt="5-12.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/egovernment-benchmark-2018-digital-efforts-european-countries-are-visibly-paying">eGovernment Benchmark Report 2018 Insight Report </a></p><h1><a id="_Toc14679032"></a>Policies for Digital Government in the European Union</h1><h2>EU policy and programmes supporting the digital transformation of public administrations</h2><p>This section of the Digital Government factsheet presents the main policy instruments and programmes that the European Union has at its disposal to support the modernisation of the public administration, through a coordinated approach, a common vision of public services, the increased provision of digital public services, achieving cross-border interoperability and facilitating user centricity. </p><p>The use of digital technologies, if based on appropriate values and principles, can help place citizens at the heart of governments' digital transformation. In particular, if local and regional administrations, which are closest to citizens and local businesses, can fully embrace this transformation it would have a significant impact on people's lives across the EU, reduce the administrative burden and strengthen confidence in public authorities and institutions. As an <a href="https://www.espon.eu/digital-transition">ESPON study</a> found, 91% of city services have improved as a result of digitalisation and 68% use the data gathered from the use of digitalised services to improve services or in decision-making processes. </p><p>On the political level, the main initiatives driving public sector modernisation are the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/digital-single-market_en">Digital Single Market</a> and the EU <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-eu-egovernment-action-plan-2016-2020-accelerating-digital-transformation">eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020</a>. Their visions and principles were confirmed in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ministerial-declaration-egovernment-tallinn-declaration">Tallinn Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment</a>. The Declaration (6 October 2017) and the European Council Conclusion (19 October 2017) represented the highest level of commitment of Member States to build a Digital Europe and to make “e-government and the deployment of new technologies, accessibility, one-stop government and the once-only principle, and a digitalised public sector […] key to transforming our societies and supporting the EU's four freedoms”. </p><p>The Declaration built on previous initiatives such as the Council of the EU Conclusions on the EU <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-eu-egovernment-action-plan-2016-2020-accelerating-digital-transformation">eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020</a>, and took note of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-champions-bratislava-statement-egovernment">statement</a> of national digital champions on eGovernment signed in Bratislava. All EU Member States and EFTA countries signed the Tallinn Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment, which confirmed their commitment to the vision laid out in the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020 and in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en">European Interoperability Framework</a>. Thus, the overall vision remains to strive to be open, efficient and inclusive, providing borderless, interoperable, personalised, user-friendly, end-to-end digital public services to all citizens and businesses – at all levels of public administration.</p><p>The political objectives, at a high level, are reflected in the EU legal instruments, as is the case of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">eIDAS Regulation</a>, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0001.01.ENG">Single Digital Gateway</a>, or the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32013L0037&amp;from=FR">Directive on the Re-use of Public Sector Information</a>, which are detailed in the following section. Political goals are also reflected in legally non-binding initiatives (soft-policy) for which the Commission plays a key role in mobilising and engaging with Member States and stakeholders in pursuing an inclusive and citizen-centric digital transformation of public administrations and services. Both legally and non-legally binding policies represent short-term and long-term objectives and actions that Member States should take in order to develop eGovernment solutions in relevant policy domains. </p><p>Furthermore, within the annual European Semester process, the Commission and the Council publish Country Specific Recommendations, which often address the topics related to modernisation of public administration. The European Semester official documents are published <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/economic-and-fiscal-policy-coordination/eu-economic-governance-monitoring-prevention-correction/european-semester_en">online</a>.</p><p>The EU also provides funding instruments available to Member States, such as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/european-structural-and-investment-funds_en">ESIF</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility">CEF</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/home_en">ISA<sup>2 </sup>programme</a>s, which are described in detail in the later part of this section. These funding instruments, together with freely reusable solutions, significantly contribute to the public sector modernisation at national and regional levels. </p><p>In addition to the strategies, policy instruments and the aforementioned funding programmes, the European Commission implements a number of legislative initiatives related to the modernisation of public sector, which are detailed in the subsequent Legal Framework section of this factsheet. Finally, the EU also offers other soft instruments to help the progress of the public sector modernisation, such as peer to peer help, the exchange of best practices via multiple platforms (such as <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/">Joinup</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eidas-observatory">FUTURIUM</a>, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/egovernment4eu">eGOV4EU</a>, etc.), and practical guidance through the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/quality-public-administration-toolbox-practitioners">Quality of Public Administration Toolbox</a>.</p><h3>Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe</h3><p>On 6 May 2015, the European Commission unveiled its detailed plans to create a strategy for implementing the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en">Digital Single Market</a>, thereby delivering on one of its top priorities. </p><p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/digital-single-market/index_en.htm">Digital Single Market Strategy</a> has benefitted from input and dialogue with Member States, the European Parliament and stakeholders. It has a multi-annual scope and is focused on key interdependent actions that can only be taken at EU level. The actions have been chosen to have maximum impact, can be delivered during this Commission's mandate, and will be taken forward in line with <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/better_regulation/documents/com_2015_215_en.pdf">Better Regulation</a> principles. Each will be subject to appropriate consultation and impact assessment. The Digital Single Market Strategy is built on three pillars:</p><p>Better access for consumers and businesses to online goods and services across Europe – this requires the rapid removal of key differences between the online and offline worlds to break down barriers to cross-border online activity.</p><p>Creating the right conditions and level playing field for digital networks and services to flourish – this requires high-speed, secure and trustworthy infrastructures and content services, supported by the right regulatory conditions for investment, fair competition and a level playing field.</p><p>Maximising the growth potential of our European Digital Economy – this requires investment in ICT infrastructures and technologies such as Cloud computing and Big Data, and research and innovation to boost industrial competitiveness, as well as better public services, inclusiveness and skills.</p><p>The third priority, ‘Maximising the Growth Potential of our European Digital Economy’, is of particular relevance for the area of eGovernment, as it includes the following actions for the Commission:</p><p>Proposing a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-single-market-free-flow-data-initiative">European free flow of data initiative</a> to promote the free movement of data in the European Union and launching a European Cloud initiative covering certification of cloud services, the switching of cloud service providers and a ‘research cloud’.</p><p>Revising and extending the European Interoperability Framework, with the new <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en">European Interoperability Framework</a> having been published on 23 March 2017.</p><p>Supporting an inclusive digital society where citizens have the right skills to seize the opportunities of the Internet and presenting a new eGovernment Action Plan (see below) for the period of 2016 – 2020 aiming to (i) modernise public administration, (ii) achieve the digital internal market to deliver public services across borders; and (iii) engage more with citizens and businesses in the design and the delivery of high quality services.</p><p>On 10 May 2017, the European Commission published the <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-1233_en.htm">mid-term review</a> of the Digital Single Market Strategy. By this date, the Commission had proposed all of the initiatives set out by the Digital Single Market Strategy. The review was done in order to ensure a timely delivery and effective implementation of the strategy. The mid-term review identified three main areas where further actions were necessary to ensure a fair, open and secure digital environment: </p><ol><li>Spurring the European data economy; </li><li>Jointly tackling growing cybersecurity challenges; </li><li>Promoting fairness and responsibility of online platforms. </li></ol><h3>EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016 - 2020</h3><p>The European <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-eu-egovernment-action-plan-2016-2020-accelerating-digital-transformation">eGovernment Action Plan 2016 - 2020</a> was launched on 19 April 2016. The Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe announced its launch and defined its aim to remove existing digital barriers to the Digital Single Market and to prevent further fragmentation arising in the context of the modernisation of public administrations.</p><p>Ahead of the publication of the new EU eGovernment Action Plan, a paper on the 'Vision for Public Services' was published. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/vision-public-services">Vision for Public Services</a> outlined the long-term vision for a modern and open public sector and the way public services may be delivered in an open government setting (enabled by ICT), i.e. how public services may be created and delivered seamlessly to any citizen and business at any moment.</p><p>The EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016 – 2020 aims to be the instrument to combine European, national and regional efforts and advance the modernisation of public administrations across the European Union. While Member States pursue their own strategies and activities, the current Action Plan, which is based on a shared long-term vision, sets out seven principles that forthcoming initiatives should observe in order to deliver significant benefits that eGovernment can bring to businesses, citizens and public administrations themselves. The achievement of these seven principles by the Member States is monitored and the results presented in the annual <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/egovernment-benchmark-2018-digital-efforts-european-countries-are-visibly-paying">eGovernment Benchmark Report</a>. The main seven principles guiding the eGovernment Action Plan and strongly supported by all stakeholders are: </p><p>Digital by Default: Public administrations should deliver services digitally (including machine readable information) as the preferred option (while still keeping other channels open for those who are disconnected by choice or necessity). In addition, public services should be delivered through a single contact point or a one-stop-shop and via different channels.</p><p>Once only principle: Public administrations should ensure that citizens and businesses supply the same information only once to a public administration. Public administration offices take action, if permitted to internally re-use this data, in due respect of data protection rules, so that no additional burden falls on citizens and businesses.</p><p>Inclusiveness and accessibility: Public administrations should design digital public services that are inclusive by default and cater for different needs such as those of the elderly and people with disabilities.</p><p>Openness &amp; transparency: Public administrations should share information and data among each other and enable citizens and businesses to access control and correct their own data; enable users to monitor administrative processes that involve them; engage with and open up to stakeholders (such as businesses, researchers and non-profit organisations) in the design and delivery of services.</p><p>Cross-border by default: Public administrations should make relevant digital public services available across borders and prevent further fragmentation to arise, thereby facilitating mobility within the Single Market. </p><p>Interoperability by default: Public services should be designed to work seamlessly across the Single Market and across organisational silos, relying on the free movement of data and digital services in the European Union.</p><p>Trustworthiness &amp; Security: All initiatives should go beyond mere compliance with the legal framework on personal data protection and privacy, and IT security, by integrating those elements in the design phase. These are important pre-conditions for increasing trust in and take-up of digital services.</p><p>The EU eGovernment Action Plan calls for the acceleration of the digital transformation of governments. At the heart of this urgency lies the potential of data; public administrations need to benefit from this, they need to become data-driven governments. Data exchange will help them to become more efficient and effective: opening up government data will help them create new services, jobs and growth, open data will allow them to engage with citizens in their decision-making process, and big data will allow them to make better informed decisions, follow compliance, predict issues, etc. </p><p>The Action Plan provides for a dynamic and flexible approach given the fast-changing environment. Beyond the actions identified in the Action Plan, further actions may be proposed either by the Commission or by stakeholders, including Member States. This is facilitated by an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/egovernment4eu">online stakeholder engagement platform</a>, which was launched in June 2016. </p><p>The Action Plan identified 20 concrete actions to accelerate the implementation of existing legislation and the related take up of online public services, under the following policy priorities:</p><p>Modernising public administration with ICT, using key digital enablers</p><p>Public administrations need to transform their back offices, to rethink and redesign existing procedures and services, and open their data and services to other administrations, and, as far as possible, to businesses and civil society. Digital public services should build on shared and reusable solutions and services based on agreed standards and technical specifications in order to reduce their cost of development, their time to deploy and increase interoperability. </p><p>Enabling cross-border mobility with interoperable digital public services</p><p>Cross-border digital public services facilitate access to markets, increase confidence in and stimulate competition across the Single Market. Administrations should: help businesses to operate online across borders within the Single Market; simplify access to information under EU business and company laws; enable businesses to easily start doing business, expand and operate in other Member States through end-to-end public eServices.</p><p>Facilitating digital interaction between administrations and citizens/businesses for high-quality public services</p><p>The new digital environment offers opportunities to facilitate the interaction of citizens, business and non-governmental organisations with public administrations. There is a promising potential to deliver such high-quality public services, by stepping up the involvement of businesses and citizens as well as researchers in their design and delivery, and by ensuring feedback for improvement where necessary. This leads to reducing red tape, easing use, lowering delivery costs.</p><p>The first update to the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020, in the context of the Digital Single Market Midterm Review in May 2017, added five new actions to the Action Plan.</p><p>Main activities under the Action Plan involve:</p><p>Accelerating the up-take of eID under eIDAS to effectively support the implementation of the digital-by-default principle in the public sector as well as to enable the fully digital provision of cross-border services;</p><p>Adopt the Single Digital Gateway Regulation, including elements of the once-only-principle for cross-border services and benefitting from the results of the ongoing <a href="https://www.esens.eu/content/toop-project-has-been-started">Large Scale Pilot TOOP</a>;</p><p>Implementation of revised EIF to ensure cross-border interoperability;</p><p>Catalogue of ICT standards for procurement;  </p><p>Call for the Commission services to digitally transform the EU administration processes;</p><p>Making the eJustice Portal a one-stop shop for information on European justice issues; </p><p>Establishing a single window for reporting purposes in maritime transport and digitalise transport eDocuments;</p><p>Accelerating the deployment and take-up of the INSPIRE Directive data infrastructure;</p><p>Completing the setup of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=869">Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information</a>;</p><p>Transforming the Commission's websites to support increasing user engagement and participation of citizens and businesses in EU programmes and policymaking. </p><p class="subtitle">Open Government</p><p>The EU eGovernment Action Plan is guided by the vision to make the public administrations and public institutions in the EU open, efficient and inclusive, providing borderless, personalised, user-friendly, end-to-end digital public services to all citizens and businesses in the EU by 2020. </p><p>Indeed, there is a paradigm shift, moving from eGovernment that focused on efficiency and effectiveness, towards a digital government approach, whereby digital is an integral part of governments' modernisation efforts. Therefore, it is no longer about efficiency and effectiveness only; digital government will also enable greater public value, good governance, more openness and transparency, greater accountability and trust.</p><p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/open-government">Open Government</a> approach can facilitate this transformation, driven by opening up public data and services and facilitating collaboration for the design, production and delivery of public services. This requires optimising process flows, opening up public sector data and services and moving from a silo mentality to a coordinated and collaborative approach. Open Government is based on the principles of collaboration, transparency and participation, functioning within an open governance framework. It is also about making government processes and decisions open, in order to foster citizen participation and engagement.</p><p>Creation of joined-up government, through breaking the internal silos between administrations, by <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/open-data">opening up data</a> and services between administrative departments, can reduce cost and avoid duplication. Breaking the silos between public administrations across borders will increase their efficiency and facilitate the cross-border mobility of businesses and citizens. </p><p>Breaking the silos with stakeholders and eventually opening public sector data, using standards Application Interfaces (APIs), and services to third parties, in full compliance with the legal framework for the protection of personal data and for privacy, will allow them to reuse these data and services. This will enable the design of targeted - personalised, pro-active and location-based services, thus facilitating digital interaction between administrations and users. This ensures user-centricity of public services and fosters collaborative service creation. </p><p>Furthermore, by opening up to stakeholders in decision-making and encouraging eParticipation, public administrations will become more trustworthy and more accountable. </p><p>An open government will support <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/node/77126">ICT-enabled public sector innovation</a>; improving the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of public services by introducing new processes, products, services and methods of delivery enabled by ICT. Indeed, while the basic administrative services remain the core of eGovernment, there is an emergence of many new types of every-day, location-based services that can be created by government or by businesses, civil society, stakeholders, etc. using the available open data, location data, as well as open services.</p><p class="subtitle">Local and Regional Dimension of the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020</p><p>Over 60% of decisions taken at the European level have a direct impact on municipalities, provinces, and regions and 70% to 80% of public investments in Europe are made by local and regional authorities. Those two figures alone are proof of the ever-increasing importance of <a href="http://www.ccre.org/docs/Local_and_Regional_Government_in_Europe.EN.pdf">European local and regional government</a> in both our world’s economy and the life of our citizens.</p><p>The EU eGovernment Action Plan recognises that essential legislation is now in place and that many technological solutions have been developed and tested. Efforts therefore need to focus on ensuring implementation, so that citizens and businesses can really reap the benefits of the digital transformation. Local and regional administrations (LRAs) have an important role both in modernising administrations and services in areas of importance for society, and in taking responsibility for directly providing their residents with services shaped to meet expectations in an increasingly digitalised world. Because of their size and agility, they also serve as an excellent basis for innovation and thereby contribute to generating economic growth, by ensuring a business-friendly environment, enabling the flourishing of data-driven businesses or by encouraging innovation to the market due to their large purchasing power.</p><p>Current regional policy is delivered through cohesion funds through the European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) and includes 11 thematic objectives; two of these are highly relevant for eGovernment. (TO2 and TO11) (SEE ESIF section).</p><p>To support the LRAs, the Commission has prepared a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/egovernment-local-and-regional-administrations-guidance-tools-and-funding-implementation">guide</a> to help them implement and find EU funding for eGovernment in line with the principles and priorities set out in the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020.</p><p class="subtitle">Cross-Border Regions</p><p>Cross-border regions, regions from at least two different Member States lying directly on the borders or adjacent to them, can tackle common challenges identified jointly in the border regions and exploit the untapped growth potential in border areas. In order to tackle the obstacles stemming from diverging national legislations, incompatible administrative processes, or lack of common territorial planning, DG REGIO is working on a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/policy/cooperation/european-territorial/cross-border/review/; ">Cross-Border Review</a>, to highlight how cross-border regions could benefit from the cross-border digital public services and key digital enablers. For its part, seamless cross-border digital public services are important enablers of the Single Digital Market.</p><p class="subtitle">Once-Only Principle</p><p>The EU eGovernment Action Plan calls on public administrations to ensure that citizens and businesses supply the same information only once (Once-Only Principle or OOP) to a public administration for certain administrative procedures, if they so wish. Public administration offices take action, if permitted, to internally re-use this data, in due respect of data protection rules, so that no additional burden falls on citizens and businesses.</p><p>In the Tallinn Declaration, Member States committed to take steps to identify redundant administrative burden in public services and introduce once only options for citizens and businesses in digital public services by collaboration and data exchange across administrations at national, regional and local level as well as with other countries for cross-border digital public services.</p><p>The regulatory proposal for the cross-border application of the OOP is contained in the <a href="http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/PE-41-2018-INIT/en/pdf">Single Digital Gateway Regulation</a>.</p><p>In view of operationalisation of the OOP at EU level, the Commission has launched several initiatives related to the European Digital Single Market and two projects related to the OOP:</p><p><a href="https://scoop4c.eu/">SCOOP4C</a> focuses its efforts on the citizens’ dimension of the OOP. The overall aim of the project is to investigate, discuss, and disseminate how co-creation and co-production in public service provisioning for citizens can be achieved by implementing the once-only principle. </p><p><a href="https://www.toop.eu/">TOOP</a> aims to explore and demonstrate the once-only principle across borders while focusing on data from businesses. Doing this, TOOP wants to enable better exchange of business-related data or documents with and between public administrations and reduce administrative burden for both businesses and public administrations.</p><p class="subtitle">User-Centricity</p><p>Member States have committed to making their public administrations user-centric in the design and delivery of digital public services (see: Tallinn Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment) and to ensure the consistent quality of user experience in digital public services as set out in the Annex <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ministerial-declaration-egovernment-tallinn-declaration">User-centricity principles for design and delivery of digital public services</a> of the declaration.</p><p>In order to support the implementation of the Tallinn Declaration - User-centricity principles and to put citizens truly at the heart of governments’ digital transformation, efforts should be emphasised on local and regional administrations that deliver most of the public services and that are often the main point of interaction between governments and citizens. For this, the Commission is proposing to cities and regions a Quality label<em> </em>representing the compliance with the Tallinn user-centricity principles. </p><p>For this action, a couple of workshops took place in Brussels with the participation of a wide set of stakeholders in <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/blog/co-creation-quality-label-citizen-centric-cities-and-regions-impressions-and-takeaways-0">April 2018</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/workshop-quality-label-user-centric-cities-and-regions">May 2019</a>. </p><p>The Quality Label may reflect undertaking some or many of the wide scope of activities already existing. For instance, many cities are experimenting with participatory budgeting (see <a href="http://eu-smartcities.eu/initiatives/844/description">Participatory Budgeting for Inclusive Smart Cities and Communities</a>), participatory urban planning (see the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/digital-transition/better-regulation-action-8-specify-and-monitoring-standardised-planned-land-use">Digital Transition Partnership's Action on Participatory urban planning'</a>), co-creation and eParticipation (see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/ict-enabled-public-sector-innovation-horizon-2020">H2020 ICT-enabled open government pilots</a>) as well as other societal engagement tools (see <a href="http://eu-smartcities.eu/initiatives/1/description">CitizenCity</a>), while others are focusing on personal data management (see the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/digital-transition/better-knowledge-action-9-mydata-digital-transition-elaboration-european-roadmap">Digital Transition Partnership's Action on MyData</a>) and preparing to be compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation, which came into force on 25 May 2018 (see <a href="http://eu-smartcities.eu/initiatives/2/activity">Citizen Centric Approach to Data</a>). Others again are focusing on reducing the administrative burden and implementing citizen-centric eGovernment services (see the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/digital-transition/better-knowledge-action-4-helping-cities-develop-user-centric-egovernment-model">Digital Transition Partnership's Action on 'Helping cities develop a user-centric eGovernment model'</a>), while ensuring that nobody is left behind in the digital transformation of government (see the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/digital-transition/better-funding-action-2-digital-neighbourhood-instrument">Digital Transition Partnership's Action on 'Digital Neighbourhood Instrument'</a>).</p><h3>Digital Transition Partnership under the Urban Agenda for the EU</h3><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/node/1829">Urban Agenda for the EU</a> is an integrated and coordinated approach to deal with the urban dimension of EU and national policies and legislation. By focusing on concrete priority themes within dedicated Partnerships, the Urban Agenda seeks to improve the quality of life in urban areas.</p><p>Launched in 2016 with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/content/pact-amsterdam">Pact of Amsterdam</a>, it represents a new multi-level working method promoting cooperation between Member States, cities, the European Commission and other stakeholders in order to stimulate growth, liveability and innovation in the cities of Europe and to identify and successfully tackle social challenges. It also focuses on the three pillars of EU policy making and implementation of Better regulation, Better funding and Better knowledge.</p><p>One of the priority themes identified is <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/digital-transition">Digital Transition</a>. In the Digital Transition Partnership, the creation of digital services to enhance the competitiveness of enterprises and improving the quality of life of people is at the core of the focus of the partnership. The European Commission (DG REGIO and DG CNECT), Estonia and the cities of Oulu (FI) and Sofia (BG) and further partners (Member States, cities and stakeholders) work together to develop an 'Urban Digital Transition' action plan.</p><p>A <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/digital-transition/digital-transition-draft-action-plan-0">Digital Transition Action Plan</a> was published in 2018, with actions looking into how to effectively implement the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020 at the local government level as well as proposing new actions at cities/urban areas to be proposed in the rolling EU eGovernment Action Plan. Other actions include an eGovernment performance measurement framework for urban authorities, with a focus on key deliverables. One of the horizontal themes to be addressed is data and standardisation. This action has been included in the eGovernment Action Plan (through the DSM Midterm Review).</p><p>The Digital Transition Action plan aims to achieve the following objectives with dedicated actions for each one: </p><p>Generalise and diffuse digital skills to everybody:  </p><ul><li>Action 1: Mainstreaming EU Digital Competence Framework for citizens into daily use;  </li><li>Action 2: Digital Neighbourhood Instrument; and   </li><li>Action 3: Capacity-Building and Spreading of Pilots in Regions and Cities.</li></ul><p>Enable and implement citizen-centric e-government: </p><ul><li>Action 4: Helping cities develop a user-centric eGovernment model; and  </li><li>Action 5: Developing the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) at local level (DESI local).</li></ul><p>Provide value through free and fair access to open/public/personal data: </p><ul><li>Action 6: Build a data taxonomy at a European level;    </li><li>Action 7: Access and reuse of private sector data of general interest by the public authorities;</li><li>Action 8: Specify and monitoring of standardised Planned Land Use data for formal and informal urban planning participation processes; and  </li><li>Action 9: MyData in digital transition – Elaboration of a European roadmap on ‘mydata’.</li></ul><p>Accelerate and adopt digital emerging technologies in cities: </p><ul><li>Action 10: Building innovation and dissemination accelerator;  </li><li>Action 11: Support agile experimentation of emerging digital technologies; and </li><li>Action 12: Implementing the digital framework for emerging technologies within the digital infrastructure.</li></ul><p>Adopt business model thinking to drive urban digital transition: </p><ul><li>Action 13: Co-creating a business model approach for cities; and   </li><li>Action 14: Development of 5G regulation to enable local micro-operators in cities. </li></ul><p>Strengthen the ability for cities to act within the digital transition: </p><ul><li>Action 15: Implementing Digital transition in European Cities.</li></ul><p>Digital transition partnership is actively seeking partners and stakeholders to be involved in further development and implementation of the action plan.</p><h3>The Tallinn Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment</h3><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ministerial-declaration-egovernment-tallinn-declaration">Tallinn Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment</a> from 2017, or the Tallinn Declaration, followed the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/sites/digital-agenda/files/ministerial-declaration-on-egovernment-malmo.pdf">Malmö Declaration</a> signed in 2009 and the launch of the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020, which recognised that service-oriented, citizen-centric, reliable and innovative government at all levels is essential to develop a dynamic, and productive European society. Since 2009, several key milestones have been achieved, such as eProcurement, the deployment of key cross border services funded by the Connecting Europe Facility programme, and electronic identification (eID).</p><p>The Tallinn Declaration provided an important impetus for Member States and the Commission, both collectively and individually, to continue to invest in accelerating the modernisation of the public sector. </p><p>The Declaration re-enforced Member States’ commitment to the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020. The Tallinn Declaration was signed by all Member States at the ministerial meeting on 6 October 2017, during Estonia’s presidency of the Council. By signing the ‘Tallinn Declaration’, Member States pledged that by 2022 they will strive to:</p><p>Implement the principles of digital-by-default, inclusiveness and accessibility;</p><p>Implement the user-centricity principles for design and delivery of digital public services, as detailed in the Annex of the declaration; </p><p>Implement the once only principle for key public services, at least as an option, for citizens and business; </p><p>Implement the principle of trustworthiness and security by ensuring that the needs of security and privacy are taken into consideration when designing public services and ICT solutions and increasing the uptake of national eID schemes; </p><p>Implement the principle of interoperability by default by designing national interoperability frameworks in line with the EIF.</p><p>Implement the principle of openness and transparency by making it possible for citizens and businesses to better manage their personal data held by public administrations. </p><p>The Declaration detailed specific action lines for each principle of the EU eGovernment Action Plan that the signatories shall implement by 2022. </p><h3>Interoperability Action Plan supporting the implementation of the revised European Interoperability Framework</h3><p>The revised <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2c2f2554-0faf-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1.0017.02/DOC_3&amp;format=PDF">European Interoperability Framework</a> was adopted on 23 March 2017. The framework provided specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services. The EIF is maintained under the ISA² Programme. It offered public administrations a total of 47 concrete recommendations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that both existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts. The new conceptual model of the revised EIF Framework is illustrated below. </p><p>The revised EIF was accompanied by the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2c2f2554-0faf-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1.0017.02/DOC_2&amp;format=PDF">Interoperability Action Plan</a>, which outlined priorities that should support the implementation of the EIF. The Action Plan was made up of a total of 22 actions, which fell under five focus areas: </p><ol><li>Ensure governance, coordination and sharing of interoperability initiatives; </li><li>Develop interoperability solutions to foster collaboration between organisations; </li><li>Engagement of stakeholders and raise awareness of interoperability; </li><li>Develop, maintain and promote key interoperability enablers;</li><li>Develop, improve and promote supporting instruments for interoperability.</li></ol><img src="img/5-13.png" alt="5-13.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/isa/files/eif_leaflet_final.pdf">ISA<sup>2 </sup>programme</a></p><h3>European Commission Digital Strategy</h3><p>By 2022, the European Commission aims to become a digitally transformed, user-focused and data-driven administration. The European Commission’s challenge in IT is two-fold: (i) the design, development and deployment of the next generation of mission-critical digital solutions; (ii) the modernisation of its legacy systems.</p><p>For this reason, the College adopted the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/EC-Digital-Strategy_en">European Commission Digital Strategy</a> on 21 November 2018, for the benefit of the Commission and each staff member. The principles of this Strategy were based on the EU eGovernment Action Plan, the European Interoperability Framework and the Tallinn Declaration.</p><p>The following are the objectives:</p><p>To support the Commission’s political priorities and activities with secure, state-of-the-art, digital solutions; </p><p>To provide the Commission with high quality, trusted, borderless, digital public services, implementing its EU-wide policies, facilitating the free flow of data and boosting the digital single market; </p><p>To enable the transformation of the Commission and maximise its role in policy-shaping by exploiting the potential of the Commission’s data; </p><p>To make the Commission a world-class ‘open administration’, a collaborative, innovative and agile institution in the service of the European Union; </p><p>To ensure that the Commission's IT assets are secure, that unauthorised access or use of information is prevented and that the Institution is protected from cyberattacks; </p><p>To guarantee the resilience of the Commission by ensuring the security, efficiency and effectiveness of its digital infrastructure and of its portfolio of digital services.</p><p>These objectives of the Digital Commission were based on actions towards the following three main foundations: (i) an effective, efficient and transparent Commission; (ii) borderless digital public services; and (iii) cybersecurity at the Commission.</p><h3>Building a European Data Economy</h3><p>On 10 January 2017, the European Commission published a new <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-building-european-data-economy">Communication on Building a European Data Economy</a>. The Communication looked at proven or potential blockages to the free movement of data and presents options to remove unjustified and or disproportionate data location restrictions in the EU. </p><p>The Communication also considered the barriers around access to and transfer of non-personal machine-generated data, data liability, as well as issues related to the portability of non-personal data, interoperability and standards. Once the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/proposal-revision-public-sector-information-psi-directive">proposal for a review of the Directive</a> on the re-use of public sector information (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-legislation-reuse-public-sector-information">PSI Directive</a>) is adopted, the scope will be enlarged to include more types of data eligible for re-use.</p><p>The Communication was accompanied by a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/news-redirect/52044">Staff Working Document</a>. </p><h3>Digitising European Industry</h3><p>On 19 April 2016, the European Commission presented a set of measures to <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/policies/digitising-european-industry">Digitise European Industry</a>. The measures to Digitise European Industry were intended to help both large and small companies, researchers and public authorities, to make the most of new technologies. They were formulated to link up national and regional initiatives and boost investment through strategic partnerships and networks. </p><p>The purpose of this Communication was to reinforce the EU's competitiveness in digital technologies and to ensure that every industry in Europe, in whichever sector, wherever situated, and no matter the size, can fully benefit from digital innovations.</p><p>Facilitated by a dynamic framework for coordination and experience sharing between public and private initiatives at EU, national and regional level, the proposed actions are expected to mobilise close to EUR 50 billion of public and private investment in the next five years.</p><h3>European Cloud Initiative</h3><p>On 19 April 2016, the European Commission presented the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-european-cloud-initiative-building-competitive-data-and-knowledge-economy-europe">European Cloud Initiative</a>, its blueprint for cloud-based services and world-class data infrastructure to ensure that scientists, businesses and public services reap benefits of the Big Data revolution. This initiative was part of a package of measures to strengthen Europe's position in data-driven innovation, to improve competitiveness and cohesion and to help create a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/digital-single-market_en">Digital Single Market</a>.</p><p>By bolstering and interconnecting existing research infrastructure, the Commission planned to create a new European Open Science Cloud that offered Europe's 1.7 million researchers and 70 million science and technology professionals a virtual environment to store, share and re-use their data across disciplines and borders. </p><p>This will be underpinned by the European Data Infrastructure, deploying the high-bandwidth networks, large scale storage facilities and super-computer capacity necessary to effectively access and process large datasets stored in the cloud. </p><p>The European Cloud Initiative will make it easier for researchers and innovators to access and re-use data and will reduce the cost of data storage and high-performance analysis. This world-class infrastructure will ensure that Europe participates in the global race for high performance computing in line with its economic and knowledge potential. The user base will over time be enlarged from the initial scientific community to the public sector and industry. </p><p>The user base of the European Open Science Cloud and of the European Data Infrastructure will be widened to the public sector, for example through large-scale pilots involving eGovernment and public sector stakeholders and by progressively opening the European Data Infrastructure to users from industry and the public sector to achieve a European dimension. </p><p>As the public sector generates massive amounts of data (e.g. Copernicus Earth observation, INSPIRE location data) and needs larger computing capacity (e.g. for real time traffic and travel information systems, for smart city applications or for policy modelling), it will benefit from economies of scale, flexibility and continuity. </p><p>As a result, the public will thus benefit from cheaper, faster, better and interconnected public services and from better policy making based on affordable and secure computing- and data-intensive services. Moreover, the European Open Science Cloud will ensure that public data is fully discoverable, accessible and exploitable by scientists, policy makers and businesses. Lessons learnt will provide concrete guidance for the adoption of cloud-based services by public administrations across Europe.</p><h3>ICT Standardisation Priorities for the Digital Single Market</h3><p>The Commission adopted on 19 April 2016 a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/news-redirect/30496">Communication setting up ICT standardisation priorities for the Digital Single Market</a> as part of the package on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/digitising-european-industry">Digitising European Industry</a>. The initiative aimed to re-energise the standard-setting system in Europe as a step towards industrial global leadership and digital innovation. The results of this plan were intended to ensure that European standards would be in place quickly enough to allow future devices to connect smoothly across the Digital Single Market.</p><p>The Commission identified the following priority areas: 5G communications, cloud computing, the internet of things (IoT), (big) data technologies and cybersecurity. These are the essential technology building blocks of the Digital Single Market. A regular review of the priorities was planned so as to respond to changes in technology and society.</p><p>Stronger European leadership in standard setting in these areas should increase competitiveness and help European innovations to better access the global market. The EU plans to support participation of European experts in international standardisation decisions, to help ensure European ideas contribute to global solutions.</p><p>Certain aspects of this priority plan also complemented and developed specific public sector requirements identified in the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2c2f2554-0faf-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1.0017.02/DOC_2&amp;format=PDF">revised</a> version of the European Interoperability Framework for European Public Services, taking on board the standardisation needs of the European public administrations.</p><p>Furthermore, as part of the eGovernment Action Plan, a catalogue of services for ICT procurement was put together. The European Catalogue will contribute to making procured solutions more interoperable and towards creating a more transparent public procurement market. The catalogue will serve as a one-stop-shop for procurers on guidelines for procurement, including on vendor lock-in, on the use of standards, and a lifecycle costing scheme that accounts for the often-neglected interoperability costs. It will streamline the numerous guidelines and provide for a platform of exchange and dissemination.</p><h3>Open Source Strategy 2014-2017</h3><p>The European Commission reviewed its internal <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/informatics/oss_tech/strategy/strategy_en.htm">Open Source Software strategy</a>. It addressed the procurement of open source software and the Commission's contribution to open source software projects. The strategy provided for more software developed within the Commission to be published as open source. </p><p>In March 2015, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/informatics/oss_tech/strategy/strategy_en.htm" target="_blank">renewed strategy for internal use of open source software</a> in the Commission was published.</p><h2>Other relevant EU initiatives</h2><h3><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/publicprocurement/e-procurement/index_en.htm">A Strategy for eProcurement</a></h3><p>eProcurement refers to the use of electronic communications by public sector organisations when buying supplies and services or tendering public works.</p><p>Increasing the use of eProcurement in Europe can generate significant savings for European taxpayers. These savings would maximise the efficiency of public spending in the current context of fiscal constraints. eProcurement can also provide a new source of economic growth and jobs, including by facilitating access to public procurement contracts by SMEs.</p><p>In April 2012, the European Commission adopted Communication <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012DC0179">COM(2012) 179</a> setting out a strategy to make the use of eProcurement the rule in the EU by mid-2016.</p><p>In June 2013, the European Commission adopted Communication <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:52013DC0453">COM(2013) 453</a> that identified the state of implementation of end-to-end eProcurement, i.e. the process  from the electronic publication of notices to electronic payment, in the EU, as foreseen by the 2012 Communication ‘A Strategy for eProcurement’. </p><p>Furthermore, as part of the eGovernment Action Plan 2016-2020, the Commission will support Member States’ transition towards end-to-end eProcurement, use of contract registers and interoperable eSignatures. The objective of the eGovernment Action Plan was that by 2018, companies anywhere in the EU could bid for public procurement contracts electronically.</p><h3>European Cloud Computing Strategy</h3><p>In September 2012, the European Commission adopted a strategy for <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2012:0529:FIN:EN:PDF">Unleashing the Potential of Cloud Computing in Europe</a>. The strategy outlined actions to deliver a net gain of 2.5 million new European jobs, and an annual boost of EUR 160 billion to the European Union GDP (around 1%), by 2020. The strategy was designed to speed up and increase the use of cloud computing across all economic sectors. This strategy was the result of an analysis of the overall policy, regulatory and technology landscapes and of a wide consultation with stakeholders, to identify ways to maximise the potential offered by the cloud. This document set out the most important and urgent additional actions. It represented a political commitment of the Commission and served as a call on all stakeholders to participate in implementing these actions. Dedicated <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/cloud-computing-strategy-working-groups">working groups</a> were created to work on this.</p><p>On 27 December 2014, the European Commission published its first Call for Tender for a Cloud Service.</p><p>Cloud services offer benefits in terms of infrastructure elasticity and scalability while favouring the pay-per-use model against upfront capital investments. The Cloud will enable the Commission to follow the ceaseless pace of today's technological race among infrastructure providers where costs of storage, bandwidth and computing power are decreasing day by day while enabling at the same time innovative solutions for new challenges such as Big Data.</p><p>Depending on their security and data qualification, information systems can be deployed either in a Private Cloud operated for the Commission and EU institutions only, or in the Public Cloud operated for external customers too. This hybrid approach allows the Commission to get the most effective solution under different circumstances to meet our changing needs.</p><h3><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/european-multi-stakeholder-platform-ict-standardisation">European Multi-Stakeholder Platform on ICT Standardisation</a></h3><p>The European Multi Stakeholder Platform (MSP) on ICT standardisation was set up at the end of 2011. Based on a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/news/commission-decision-28-november-2011-setting-european-multi-stakeholder-platform-ict">European Commission Decision 2011/EC 349/04</a> to advice on matters related to the implementation of ICT standardisation policies, it dealt with:</p><p>Potential future ICT standardisation needs in support of European legislation, policies and public procurement;</p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/identification-ict-specifications">Technical specifications</a> for public procurements, developed by global ICT standards-developing organisations;</p><p>Cooperation between ICT standards-setting organisations;</p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/rolling-plan-ict-standardisation">The Rolling Plan</a>, which provides a multi-annual overview of the needs for preliminary or complementary ICT standardisation activities in support of the EU policy activities.</p><p>The MSP is composed of representatives of national authorities from EU Member States &amp; EFTA countries, by the European and international ICT standardisation bodies, and by stakeholder organisations that represent industry, small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers. It is co-chaired by the European Commission Directorates General <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/index_en.htm">GROWTH</a>, and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/connect/">CONNECT</a>. It meets four times per year.</p><h3>Common Assessment Model Standards and Specifications (CAMSS)</h3><p><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/common-assessment-method-standards-and-specifications-camss/about">CAMSS</a> aims at promoting collaboration between public administrations through a Common Assessment Method for Standards and Specifications. </p><p>This helps to expand interoperability between EU Member States through the sharing of information and knowledge, and the alignment of national processes by using CAMSS. It also aims to speed up the assessment processes, reduce their cost throughout European public administrations and avoid ICT vendor specific lock-in.</p><p>The main objective of CAMSS is to become the method of reference for the assessment of technical specifications and standards in the field of ICT.</p><p>Beneficiaries of CAMSS are public administrations in the Member States and EU institutions, standardisation bodies and the IT services industry. For these beneficiaries, CAMSS aims at providing a best practice (common) assessment method and guidance for the assessment of ICT technical specification or standards when defining ICT architectures and establishing European public services.</p><p>The use of the CAMSS by Member States helps to promote transparency in the choice of eGovernment solutions and standards and also lead to a more efficient use of public funds via sharing and reuse among eGovernment projects. The CAMSS toolkit consists of: </p><p>A documented reference assessment process; </p><p>A set of quality requirements (criteria); </p><p>Assessment tools: online and offline (also in open source);</p><p>The collection of assessments performed with the method;</p><p>A list of standards which compiles standards and specifications (recommended and mandatory) that are included in national lists.</p><p>CAMSS is supported through ISA<sup>2</sup> Action 2016.27.</p><h3>Interoperability Maturity Assessment of a Public Service (IMAPS)</h3><p>Nowadays, public administrations can no longer exist in isolation. They must interact with many other administrative bodies, often across borders and sectors, and share and utilise services, data, and business processes with them. In other words, they must be interoperable.</p><p>The <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/imaps">IMAPS</a> (Interoperability Maturity Assessment of a Public Service) is a self-assessment tool that will evaluate and ultimately improve European public service interoperability maturity. It currently consists of:</p><p>A compact and user-friendly self-assessment through the IMAPS online survey. This 30-minute <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/distribution/access_url/2018-02/402ca761-e487-48e3-8aee-23335200ca42/IMAPS v1.1.1 Questionnaire.pdf">questionnaire</a> looks at the context of the public service, how the service is delivered, how it consumes existing services and how it is managed.</p><p>On completion of the IMAPS, the Results Output offers tailored recommendations and confidential improvement guidance.</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/isa/files/imaps_value_proposition.pdf">IMAPS</a> is designed to help public service owners (i.e. those in charge of key services such as online tax filing, online business registration, online change of address, etc. – no matter at what government level: national, regional, local, international) evaluate, improve and consider all key interoperability aspects of their public service. The IMM distinguishes between three different domains of interoperability:</p><p>Service Delivery – Providing end-users accessibility to the public service;</p><p>Service Consumption – Consumption of reusable services from other public administrations and businesses. This can include the consumption of functionalities, base registry information and security services;</p><p>Service Management – Controlling and monitoring the process flow related to external service interactions from trigger to outcome.</p><h3>EU Catalogue of Standards for ICT Procurement</h3><p>Under the ISA<sup>2</sup> programme, the European Commission is creating a <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/community/european_catalogue/og_page/catalogue">Catalogue of Standards of ICT Procurement</a>. The European Catalogue will contribute to ensure that procured solutions are interoperable and help to make the ICT procurement market more transparent. The Catalogue will offer a one-stop-shop for procurers on guidelines for procurement, including on vendor lock-in, on the use of standards, and a lifecycle costing scheme that accounts for the often-neglected interoperability costs. It will streamline the numerous guidelines and provide for a platform of exchange and dissemination.</p><p>At the present moment the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ict-standards-procurement/catalogue">Catalogue</a> is a draft version, a concept demonstrator. The first priority, under the ISA<sup>2</sup> programme, is to finalise the needs. The prototype proposes needs in four domains: cloud computing, transport systems, eGovernment, and smart and efficient use of energy. Surveys and targeted workshops were organised to finalise the needs in procurement by the end of 2017.</p><p>In February 2017, the European Commission launched an open public consultation to improve the draft contents of the Catalogue. The consultation aimed at collecting feedback on the contents, and at receiving advices on possible catalogue structure improvements.</p><h3>ISA² Core Vocabularies</h3><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/core-vocabularies_en">Core Vocabularies</a> are simplified, reusable, and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity, such as a person or a public organisation, in a context-neutral manner.</p><p>Public administrations can use and extend the Core Vocabularies in the following contexts:</p><p>Information exchange between systems: the Core Vocabularies can become the basis of a context-specific data model used to exchange data among existing information systems.</p><p>Data integration: the Core Vocabularies can be used to integrate data that comes from disparate data sources.</p><p>Data publishing: the Core Vocabularies can be used as the foundation of a common export format for data in base registries like cadastres, business registers and service portals.</p><p>Development of new systems: the Core Vocabularies can be used as a default starting point for designing the conceptual and logical data models in newly developed information systems.</p><p>ISA² has developed the Core Vocabularies for public administrations in an open process with the active involvement of the SEMIC and Catalogue of Service action stakeholders.</p><p>The Core Vocabularies are:</p><p>Core Person: captures the fundamental characteristics of a person, e.g. name, gender, date of birth, location.</p><p>Core Business: describes legal entities (e.g. its identifier, activities) which are created through a formal registration process, typically in a national or regional register.</p><p>Core Location: about the main characteristics of a location, represented as an address, a geographic name or geometry.</p><p>Core Criterion and Core Evidence: describes the principles and the means that a private entity must fulfil to become eligible or qualified to perform public services. A <em>criterion</em> is a rule or a principle that is used to judge, evaluate or test something. An <em>evidence</em> is a means to prove a <em>criterion</em>.</p><p>Core Public Organisation: describes public organisations in the European Union.</p><p>Core Public Service Vocabulary (Application Profile) (CPSV-AP): provides a common data model for describing public services offered by public administrations. It standardises the semantics of personal milestones, including having a child, beginning education, looking for a new job, as well as professional changes such as starting or financing a company, hiring an employee. The descriptions will make data on these events structured, easier to capture and machine-readable.</p><h2>Main EU funding programmes</h2><h3>The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF)</h3><p>On 29 June 2011, the European Commission adopted <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:348:0129:0171:EN:PDF">a proposal for the next Multi-Annual Financial Framework for the period 2014-2020</a>. In this Framework, a new integrated investment instrument was proposed to improve Europe’s transport, energy and digital networks: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/connecting-europe-facility">The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF).</a> Well-functioning infrastructures are a key condition to achieve the Europe 2020 targets. By investing in the three main networks to make them smart, sustainable and fully interconnected, Europe’s competitiveness will be boosted and new jobs will be created. </p><p>Article 5 of the CEF Regulation allocated to the Digital sector an overall envelope of EUR 1.14 billion, for connectivity actions and the deployment of Digital Service Infrastructures (DSIs) delivering networked cross-border services for citizens, businesses and public administrations. These projects contributed to:</p><p>Improvements in the competitiveness of the European economy;</p><p>Promotion of the interconnection and interoperability of national, regional and local networks;</p><p>Access to such networks, thus supporting the development of a Digital Single Market.</p><p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/broadband-europe">Connectivity</a> component of the programme sought to contribute to the achievement of the Digital Agenda targets of all European households having access to internet connections of 30 Megabits per Second by 2020, and of 50% of households subscribing to internet connections above 100 Megabits per Second by 2020.</p><p>In view of these targets, CEF aims at facilitating an efficient flow of private and public investments to stimulate the deployment and modernisation of broadband networks. At least one third of the broadband projects financially supported under CEF aims at speeds above 100Mbps.</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/CEF+Digital+Home">Digital Service Infrastructures (DSIs)</a> facilitates the cross-border and cross-sector interaction between European public administrations. This, in turn, enables the provision of essential services for businesses and citizens in areas as diverse as electronic identification and procurement, and interoperable health services.</p><p>Projects are focused on deploying a relatively small number of trans-European infrastructures based upon mature technical and organisational solutions and aimed at supporting exchanges and collaboration with and within the public sector, across the EU.</p><p>The DSIs also entail the roll-out of the CEF building blocks that capitalised on the solutions for interoperability developed through Large Scale Pilots (such as eID, eProcurement, electronic Healthcare records, eJustice). </p><h3>Horizon 2020</h3><p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/what-horizon-2020">Horizon 2020</a> is an EU Research and Innovation programme with nearly EUR 80 billion of funding available over seven years (2014 to 2020).</p><p>Horizon 2020 is the financial instrument implementing the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/innovation-union/index_en.cfm">Innovation Union</a>, a Europe 2020 flagship initiative aimed at securing Europe's global competitiveness.</p><p>Seen as a means to drive economic growth and create jobs, Horizon 2020 has the political backing of Europe’s leaders and the Members of the European Parliament. They agreed that research is an investment in the future of Europe, and so put it at the heart of the EU’s blueprint for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and jobs.</p><p>By coupling research and innovation, Horizon 2020 is helping to achieve this with its emphasis on excellent science, industrial leadership and tackling societal challenges. The goal is to ensure Europe produces world-class science, removes barriers to innovation and makes it easier for the public and private sectors to work together in delivering innovation. Horizon 2020 is open to everyone, with a simple structure that reduces red tape and time so participants can focus on what is really important. This approach makes sure new projects get off the ground quickly – and achieve results faster.</p><p>Horizon 2020 reflects the policy priorities of the Europe 2020 strategy and addresses major concerns shared by citizens in Europe and elsewhere. Horizon 2020 covers seven different domains of actions called ‘Societal Challenges’. The Societal Challenge 6 ‘Europe in a changing world – Inclusive, innovative and reflective societies’ deals with a series of societal issues and, among others, addresses directly problems related to eGovernment and modernisation of public administrations. The research and innovation actions in this area for 2014 and 2015 focused on demonstrating the open and collaborative government concept through the following topics:</p><p>Research into using emerging technologies in public sector;</p><p>Pilots on open participation of the youth in decision-making processes;</p><p>ICT-enabled open government; innovation actions for mobile, personalised public services and transparency of public administrations;</p><p>Design and creation of innovative applications by SMEs, in order to foster the delivery of mobile public services (eGovernment apps) for local and regional public authorities.</p><p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/wp/2016_2017/main/h2020-wp1617-societies_en.pdf" target="_blank">The Work Programme 2016-2017</a> supported eGovernment / ICT-enabled public sector innovation related activities through the following topics:</p><p>Applied co-creation to deliver public services;</p><p>Co-creation between public administrations: once-only principle;</p><p>Policy-development in the age of big data: data-driven policy making, policy modelling and policy implementation;</p><p>Understanding the transformation of European public administrations;</p><p>New business models for inclusive, innovative and reflective societies.</p><p>All of the Horizon 2020 funded projects can be accessed on their main <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/home_en.html">database</a>.</p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/news/horizon-2020-work-programme-2018-2020" target="_blank">The Work Programme 2018-2020</a> continues to support ICT-enabled public sector innovation in Europe in a number of ways, addressing the following topics:</p><p>The challenge of migration integration through ICT-enabled solutions;</p><p>Transformative impact of disruptive technologies in public services;</p><p>New forms of delivering public goods and inclusive public services;</p><p>Pilot on using the European Cloud Infrastructure for public administrations;</p><p>Digital Solutions and e-tools to modernise the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) (jointly with Societal Challenge 2).</p><p>All Horizon 2020 funded projects can be accessed on their main <a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/home_en.html">database</a> on CORDIS.</p><p>CORDIS, managed by the <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/guidance/op_en.html">Publications Office</a> of the European Union, is the Community Research and Development Information Service. It is the European Commission's primary public repository and portal to disseminate information on all EU-funded research projects and their results in the broadest sense. CORDIS content dates back to the origin of the service in 1990 and the website has been online since 1994. </p><h3>European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF)</h3><p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/contracts_grants/funds_en.htm">European Structural and Investment Funds</a> also provide investments in the field of eGovernment in less favoured regions, as this is seen as a strategic component of their economic and social development. As stipulated in Article 9 of the Common Provisions Regulation, which lays down the common rules applicable to ESIF, each ESIF must also support eleven thematic objectives (TO), including thematic objectives 2 and 11 which are particularly relevant to the modernisation of public administrations.</p><p>Thematic Objective 2 (TO2):<em> </em>Aims to enhance access to, and use and quality of, information and communication technologies. Between 2014 and 2020, around EUR 3.4 billion will support eGovernment services and applications and around EUR1 billion will support the access to public sector information </p><p>The main specific characteristics describing TO2 are:</p><p>Extending broadband deployment and the roll-out of high-speed networks;</p><p>Developing ICT products and services, eCommerce and enhancing demand for ICT;</p><p>Strengthening ICT applications for eGovernment, eLearning, eInclusion and eHealth; </p><p>Enhancing the accessibility, use and quality of information and communication technologies, through the development of digital literacy, investment in eInclusion, eSkills and related entrepreneurial skill.</p><p>ESIF Thematic Objective 11 (TO11), as set by the European Commission, aims to enhance institutional capacity and to support the efficiency of public administrations. In the current programming period of 2014-2020, overall EUR 4.2 billion will be spent on administrative capacity building.</p><p>The European Social Fund (ESF) foresees two investment priorities under TO11:</p><p>Investment in institutional capacity and in the efficiency of public administration and public services at the national, regional and local levels with a view to reforms, better regulation and good governance (Article 3(d) (i) ESF Regulation); </p><p>Capacity building for all stakeholders delivering education, lifelong learning, training and employment and social policies, including through sectorial and territorial pacts to mobilise in order to reform at the national, regional and local levels (Article 3(d) (ii) ESF Regulation).</p><h3>Structural Reform Support Programme (and Service)</h3><p>The Union has identified the implementation of structural reforms among its policy priorities to set the recovery on a sustainable path, unlock the growth potential to strengthen the adjustment capacity, and support the process of convergence. </p><p>Yet the reforms must be well-designed, legislated and effectively implemented, and therefore it became necessary to establish a <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/05/11-structural-reform/">Structural Reform Support Programme</a> with the objective of strengthening the overall capacity of Member States to prepare and implement growth-enhancing institutional, structural and administrative reforms, including through assistance for the efficient and effective use of Union funds, to the extent that these Member States request support from the Union for this purpose. </p><p>In May 2017, the Council approved a EUR 142.8 million programme to help Member States implement structural reforms. The intention is to provide for an extension – under the auspices of the Structural Reform Support Service (SRSS) – of technical support to all Member States requesting it. </p><h3>ISA² (Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations) programme</h3><p>On 25 November 2015, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/isa/isa2/index_en.htm">the ISA²</a>, the follow-up programme to ISA was <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1449478436536&amp;uri=CELEX:32015D2240">officially adopted</a> by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.</p><p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/isa">ISA</a> (Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations) provided a framework that allowed Member States to work together to create efficient and effective electronic cross-border and cross-sector public services. The programme supported and maintained the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en" target="_blank">European Interoperability Framework (EIF)</a> and contained actions on:</p><p>Trusted information exchange;</p><p>Interoperability architecture;</p><p>Assessment of the ICT implications of new EU legislation;</p><p>Accompanying measures, such as communication activities, evaluation of progress in implementing the programme, and, among other measures, the new action on the ISA collaboration platform, which resulted in the creation of the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/">Joinup</a> portal focusing on eGovernment, semantic interoperability and Open Source Software (OSS).</p><p>The follow-up programme, ISA², covers the period 2016 - 2020 with a financial envelope of EUR 131 million. This programme supports the development of interoperable digital solutions, which will be available to all interested public administrations in Europe.</p><p>The main beneficiaries of ISA² are public administrators at EU, national, regional and local level (direct beneficiaries), as well as citizens and businesses (indirect beneficiaries).</p><p>What is new in ISA²?</p><p>The new programme builds strongly on its predecessor, while also bringing a handful of new elements, such as:</p><p>A focus on the link between Public Administrations and businesses and citizens;</p><p>Covering all levels of administration;</p><p>An essential contribution to the Digital Single Market strategy;</p><p>The goal of increased synergies with relevant EC initiatives;</p><p>The adoption of a holistic approach to interoperability with the responsibility for <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/isa/documents/isa_annex_i_eis_en.pdf">European Interoperability Strategy (EIS)</a>, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/isa/documents/isa_annex_ii_eif_en.pdf">European Interoperability Framework (EIF)</a>, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/isa/ready-to-use-solutions/eira_en.htm">European Interoperability Reference Architecture (EIRA)</a> and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/isa/ready-to-use-solutions/eira_en.htm">the European Interoperability Cartography (EIC)</a>.</p><h3>Justice Programme</h3><p>This programme will contribute to the further development of a European area of justice based on mutual recognition and mutual trust. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/grants1/programmes-2014-2020/justice/index_en.htm">Justice Programme</a> provides dedicated calls for eJustice projects. </p><h3>Monitoring mechanisms</h3><p>In order to monitor countries’ progress towards modernisation of public administration, especially the advancement of eGovernment, the European Commission publishes annually the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/new-study-egovernment-services-europe-improving-cross-border-availability-services">eGovernment Benchmark Report</a>, which overlooks the state-of-play of eGovernment across Europe. Indicators on certain aspects of eGovernment can also be found in the yearly published country-specific Digital Economy and Society Index (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/desi">DESI</a>) reports, in Europe’s Digital Progress Reports (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-digital-progress-report-edpr-country-profiles">EDPR</a>) and the Digital Government factsheets which are updated in the frame of the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/national-interoperability-framework-observatory-nifo/egovernment-factsheets">NIFO</a> observatory. </p><p>The revised European Interoperability Framework (EIF) was introduced in 2017, accompanied by the Interoperability Action Plan (IAP). The IAP guides the EIF implementation and it focuses on ensuring governance, coordinating and sharing interoperability initiatives. The monitoring and evaluation activities are conducted within the remit of the NIFO observatory as from 2019. Additionally, implementation of several initiatives is monitored on the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/">Joinup</a> platform and other observatories.  </p><p class="subtitle">eGovernment Benchmark Report</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/egovernment-benchmark-2018-digital-efforts-european-countries-are-visibly-paying">eGovernment Benchmark Report</a> presents the results of the assessment of eGovernment services made according to the eGovernment Benchmark Framework in 34 countries (EU Member States, Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, Republic of Serbia, Switzerland and Turkey). The assessment covers the priority areas of the eGovernment Action Plan. Each priority is measured by one or more indicators, included in the so-called top-level benchmarks (User-centric Government, Transparent Government, Cross-border Mobility and Key Enablers). </p><p>Mystery Shoppers are trained and briefed to observe, experience and measure public service processes related to life events, covering most common domains of public services, representative for businesses and citizens.  A complete measurement of all life events takes two years. Regular business operations, moving locations, car ownership and small claims procedures are measured in odd years while starting up a business, losing and finding a job, studying and family life are measured in even years. <a id="_Ref7686280"></a></p><p class="subtitle">Digital Economy and Society Index</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index</a> (DESI) is a composite index that summarises relevant indicators on Europe’s digital performance and tracks the evolution of EU Member States in digital competitiveness.

Public sector organisations authorising this type of reuse continue to hold copyright and related rights. They are, however, invited to exercise their copyrights in a way that facilitates re-use.</p><p>Directive 2003/98/EC laid down a clear obligation for Member States to make all documents re-usable unless access was restricted or excluded under national rules on access to documents and subject to the other exceptions laid down in this Directive. The Directive did not seek to define or to change access regimes in Member States, which remain their responsibility. <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:175:0001:0008:EN:PDF">Directive 2013/37/EU</a> extended the scope of Directive 2003/98/EC to libraries, including university libraries, museums and archives.</p><p>In 2017, in line with the mid-term review of the Digital Single Market strategy, the Commission announced the review of the PSI Directive.

Thanks to eIDAS, the EU now has a predictable legal framework providing legal certainty beyond national borders for electronic identification (eID) and for electronic trust services (such as electronic signatures, seals, time stamping, delivery services and website authentication).</p><p>In this regard, the eIDAS Regulation: </p><p>Ensured that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services in other EU countries where eIDs are available.</p><p>Created a European internal market for trust services by ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as traditional paper-based processes. </p><p>With the eIDAS Regulation, the relevant implementing acts, and including standards as well as a technical interoperability infrastructure, which was rolled out under the Connecting Europe Facility, the EU became the first and only region in the world having a holistic, workable and balanced legal framework for cross-border use of electronic identification and trust services. The EU was ahead of the game in the eIDAS domain with world-class providers of hardware (e.g. smartcards), software and services (e.g. e-signature, eID, eDelivery), as well as administrations at the forefront of eGovernment.</p><p>Rolling out eIDAS meant higher security and more convenience for any online activity such as submitting tax declarations, enrolling in a foreign university, access to health data, remotely opening a bank account, setting up a business in another Member State, authenticating for internet payments, and so on.</p><p>The eIDAS Regulation entered into force on 17 September 2014. It laid down specific application dates for the following:</p><p>Rules on trust services (electronic signatures, seals, time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and website authentication) were directly applicable to all EU Member States since 1 July 2016.</p><p>While all Member States were required to recognise other Member States' notified eID means as of 29 September 2018, the voluntary recognition of eIDs has been allowed since 29 September 2015, following the adoption of relevant implementing acts. This meant that an EU Member State may, on a voluntary basis, notify and recognise national eID means that citizens and companies could use across borders to access online public services. To date (and the information is continuously updated), 25 Member States have national eID means in place, whether eID cards or other means.</p><p>To this end, Member States have been working on setting up their national eIDAS nodes, i.e. the required infrastructure for the eID cross-border connection, and all are expected to be ready by the required deadline.</p><p>The Commission has been providing help via the Connecting Europe Facility Programme, under which calls have been granted to Member States to ensure the setting up of the nodes at national level and the relevant connections – also including the private sector (in particular digitally enabled sectors like banking, payment, eCommerce). </p><p>The eIDAS Regulation is already having an impact on different policy domains. In the financial sector, the <a href="http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2017/12/20/money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing-presidency-and-parliament-reach-agreement/">5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive</a> agreed on 20 December 2017, recognised notified eID means under the eIDAS Regulation as capable of providing a legal proof of identity equivalent to in-person verification of the eID means holder, while electronic trust services under eIDAS were also referenced in the agreed text. This meant that eIDAS notified eID means could be used as a possible way to fulfil Know-Your-Customer/Customer Due Diligence requirements for non-face-to-face interactions. In that sense, to further explore how to facilitate the cross-border use of eID and Know-Your-Customer (KYC) portability based on identification and authentication tools under eIDAS <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetailDoc&amp;id=36277&amp;no=1">a new expert group</a> was established. </p><p>eIDAS also helps to authenticate customers and to make secure communication between payment providers possible. On 27 November 2017, the Commission adopted the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/3/2017/EN/C-2017-7782-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF">Delegated Regulation on Regulatory Technical Standards</a> (RTS) on strong customer authentication and common and secure communication under the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en">Payment Services Directive (PSD2)</a>. The RTS was based on the draft submitted by the European Banking Authority, and reference is made to both eIDAS notified eID means, which was considered as a possible solution for strong customer authentication, and trust services, as qualified electronic seals or qualified website authentication certificates became mandatory for communication between payment providers.</p><p>The Commission is also promoting the acceptance of trusted eID means under eIDAS by online platforms. The Communication on Online Platforms and the Digital Single Market <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-288-EN-F1-1.PDF">(COM(2016)288)</a> launched an action "to encourage online platforms to recognise other eID means — in particular those notified under the eIDAS Regulation (EC) 910/2014 — that offer the same reassurance as their own". To that end, the Commission is working on a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/blog/rolling-out-eidas-final-draft-principles-and-guidance-eid-interoperability-online-platforms">set of principles and guidelines on eID interoperability</a> via a public consultation.</p><p>eIDAS Regulation has also been recognised as an effective means for fostering online accountability in the Communication on Tackling online disinformation: a European Approach (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2018/EN/COM-2018-236-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF">COM(2018)236</a>). There, it has been acknowledged that eIDAS regulation provides a predictable regulatory environment for electronic identification, authentication and trust services that could be relied upon to develop voluntary systems for the secure identification of suppliers of information.</p><p>Further work on promoting the widespread use of eIDAS is ongoing. The <a href="https://publications.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/b412b273-437c-11e8-a9f4-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-69424739">feasibility study on eID for access to student services</a> assessed the opportunities generated by the eIDAS Regulation for services offered by higher education institutions, with the aim to support student mobility as envisaged in the project for a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/news/towards-european-education-area-2025-2017-nov-14_en">European Education Area</a>. In addition, the <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobileeconomy/europe/">GSMA</a> report showed that trusted eID under eIDAS could be used for granting secure access to digital services with authentication credentials in mobile environments.</p><p class="subtitle">Regulation (EU) No 211/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on the Citizens’ Initiative</p><p>This <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2011:065:0001:0022:en:PDF">Regulation</a> established the procedures and conditions required for a citizens’ initiative as provided for in Article 11 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0013:0045:en:PDF">TEU</a> and Article 24 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:12012E/TXT">TFEU</a>.

Member States were given 21 months to transpose the Directive into their national laws and six months more to identify operators of essential services. </p><p>The Directive ensured Member States’ preparedness for cyber threats by requiring them to be appropriately equipped, e.g. via a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) and a competent national NIS authority; cooperation among all the Member States by setting up a cooperation group, in order to support and facilitate strategic cooperation and the exchange of information among Member States. They were required to establish a CSIRT Network, in order to promote swift and effective operational cooperation on specific cybersecurity incidents and sharing information about risks. A culture of security across sectors was considered vital for the economy and society which relied heavily on ICT, such as energy, transport, water, banking, financial market infrastructures, healthcare and digital infrastructure. </p><p>In 2017, the Commission put forward a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2017-4460501_en">draft Implementing Regulation Pursuant Art 16(8) of the NIS Directive</a>.

In this context, on 4 May 2016, the official texts of the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.119.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:L:2016:119:TOC">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) were published in the EU Official Journal in all the official languages. The provisions of the Regulation became directly applicable in all Member States on 25 May 2018. </p><p>The aim of GDPR was to update data protection rules in order to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches in an increasingly data-driven world that was vastly different from the time in which the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046">Directive 95/46/EC</a> was established. The data protection reform was seen as a key enabler of the Digital Single Market which the Commission has prioritised. The reform allowed European citizens and businesses to fully benefit from the digital economy.</p><p>The GDPR acknowledged that several challenges exist when it comes to the state-of-play of data protection in Europe. Firstly, the Directive of 1995 was not in line with the rapid digitisation. Furthermore, there were new challenges for the protection of personal data due to rapid technological developments and globalisation, and there was an increase in the scale of the collection and sharing of personal data. In this regard, the GDPR Regulation introduced several significant changes when it came to data protection in the EU:</p><p>Each private company working with data needed to have delegated Data Protection Officers;</p><p>Companies not complying with the Regulation faced fines of up to EUR 10 million or 2% of the company's global annual turnover; </p><p>Introduction of the 'privacy by design' principle; </p><p>Data controllers were required to: (i) maintain certain documentation, (ii) conduct a data protection impact assessment for more risky processing (DPAs may compile lists of what is caught), and (iii) implement data protection by design and by default, e.g. data minimisation. </p><p>Furthermore, according to the Regulation data subjects:</p><p>Must consent to the collection and use of their data;</p><p>Have the right for their information to be 'forgotten’.</p><p class="subtitle">Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the Protection of Individuals with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data by the Community institutions and Bodies and on the Free Movement of Such Data [Official Journal L8 of 12.01.2001]</p><p><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32001R0045&amp;from=EN">This Regulation</a> contained provisions aiming to protect personal data processed by European Union (EU) institutions and bodies. These provisions aimed to ensure a <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/information_society/data_protection/l24222_en.htm">high level of protection for personal data</a> managed by Community institutions and bodies.</p><p>This Regulation also provided for the establishment of a European Data Protection Authority, an independent Community authority responsible for monitoring the correct application of the data protection rules by the EU institutions and bodies. This authority was comparable to the data protection authorities established by Member States in accordance with Directive <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML">95/46/EC</a> on data protection. Citizens were thus able to lodge complaints directly with that authority if they considered their data protection rights under the Regulation had not been respected.</p><p>Each Community institution and body was required to appoint at least one person as the Data Protection Officer tasked with cooperating with the Data Protection Supervisor and ensuring that the rights and freedoms of data subjects were unlikely to be adversely affected by the data processing. Citizens enjoyed legally enforceable rights under the Regulation, such as the right to access, rectify, block or delete personal data relating to them in files held by the Community institutions and bodies.</p><h3>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474968"></a>Directive 2012/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2012 Amending Council Directive 89/666/EEC and Directives 2005/56/EC and 2009/101/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as Regards the Interconnection of Central, Commercial and Companies Registers</p><p><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32012L0017">Directive 2012/17/EU</a> on the interconnection of business registers entered into force on 7 July 2012. Member States had two years to adapt their national laws to introduce the first set of provisions in the Directive, including a new obligation on business registers to make available documentation submitted by limited liability companies normally within 21 days of receipt. Ensuring that information about companies was always up to date was one of the main objectives of this Directive. Business registers were required to make available information on the rules in their national law, according to which third parties could rely on certain company documents. This information was also available on the <a href="https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_business_registers_in_member_states-106-en.do?clang=en">eJustice portal</a>.</p><p>The Directive also required a Business Registers Interconnection System (BRIS) to be established. The Commission implementing <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2015.144.01.0001.01.ENG">Regulation (EU) 2015/884</a> set out technical specifications and procedures required for the system of interconnection of business registers. Member States had to transpose the remaining rules and make the necessary preparations for connecting to the new system by 8 June 2017. BRIS made it easy to access information on EU companies via the <a href="https://e-justice.europa.eu/home.do">eJustice</a> or other national portals. In addition, it facilitated electronic communication between registers in relation to cross-border mergers and branches of companies registered in other Member States.</p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474969"></a>Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on Public Procurement and Repealing Directive 2004/18/EC </p><p>The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.094.01.0065.01.ENG">Directive</a>, which took effect on 26 February 2014, set out the legal framework for public procurement, including electronic procurement. It established the procedures which must be followed before awarding a contract to suppliers (i.e. providers of works, supplies or services) when its value exceeded set thresholds, unless it qualified for a specific exclusion - e.g. on grounds of national security. </p><p>The Directive introduced a set of new rules, including a new electronic self-declaration for bidders (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/e-procurement/espd_en">ESPD</a>), which paved the way for the digitisation of public procurement, which considerably increased the efficiency of the public procurement system. For instance, only the winning company needed to submit all the documentation proving that it qualified for a contract. This drastically reduced the volume of documents needed for selecting companies.</p><p>The EU Member States were required to transpose the Directive into national law by 18 April 2016. </p><p class="subtitle">Directive 2014/55/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on Electronic Invoicing in Public Procurement </p><p>EU countries and the European Commission decided to introduce a European Standard for eInvoicing in response to the many eInvoice formats used across the EU.

In particular, it required Member States to remove unjustified and disproportionate burdens and to substantially facilitate the establishment of a business and the cross-border provision of services.</p><p>Pursuant to the Directive, Member States were obliged to set up <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=8342">points of single contact</a>, through which service providers can obtain all relevant information and deal with all administrative formalities without the need to contact several authorities.
