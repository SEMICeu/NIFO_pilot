The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below. </p><p><img src="img/35-343.png" alt="35-343.png" /> </p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021 </a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Hungary in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-382.png" alt="35-382.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Hungary’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, with all principles falling within the EU average except Principle 10 for which it scored 3. Specifically, Hungary should simplify its processes and use digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users’ requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens (Principle 10 – Recommendation 17). In addition, other areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 7 (Inclusion and accessibility), 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) <a id="_Hlk75095696"></a>for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the alignment and tailoring of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies with the EIF (Principle 1 – Recommendation 1), the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14), the availability of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16) and the implementation of evaluation mechanisms to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of interoperable solutions (Principle 12 – Recommendation 19) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p><img src="img/35-393.png" alt="35-393.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Hungarian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall high performance with a score of 4, with the exception of the area of interoperability governance, for which Hungary scored 3. This score could be particularly improved with the existence of defined processes for the selection and adoption of standards and specifications (Recommendation 21), the use of a structured, transparent, objective and common approach for the assessment and selection of standards and specifications (Recommendation 22) and the consultation of relevant catalogues for standards, specifications and guidelines at the national and EU level (Recommendation 23) by Hungary.</p><p><img src="img/35-408.png" alt="35-408.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Hungary’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model, internal information sources and services, base registries and open data. However, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to the catalogues, external information sources and services and security and privacy. In particular, putting in place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions (Catalogues - Recommendation 44), the lack of use of external information sources and services while developing European public services (External information and services – Recommendation 45) as well as the lack of trust services providers within the country (Recommendation 47) hinder the overall Hungarian score on the conceptual model.</p><p>Additional information on Hungary’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

More specifically, it identifies the need to establish a data-based administration in the country, with interoperable data connections between administrative services on different levels (local, national and European) and aspects (legal, organisational, semantic and technical). </p><p>Apart from technology neutrality and IT security requirements, a development based on software with open-source codes needs to be encouraged. To that end, the legislative framework was established according to the National Infocommunication Strategy 2014–2020 with the adoption of <a href="http://njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=193173">Act No. CCXXII of 2015 on the General Rules for Electronic Administration and Trust Services</a> (hereinafter, the eAdministration Act). Pursuant to the eAdministration Act, from 1 January 2018 the cooperating bodies involved in administrative processes shall obtain information (data or documents) from another cooperating body rather than asking the customer (citizen or business) to resubmit it. Information must be obtained by automated data exchange processes, where possible, or otherwise by a simple secure information exchange.

The 2013 amendment of the PSI Directive was then implemented by the deadline of 2015 (Act No. XCVI of 2015). The Hungarian implementation went beyond the provisions of the PSI Directive in some points. </p><p>Furthermore, the new <a href="https://ai-hungary.com/api/v1/companies/15/files/137203/view">Strategy on Artificial Intelligence 2020–2030</a> was adopted, including a dedicated part on data policy and data reuse which calls for a proper institutional background and a one‑way‑access data portal. Within the framework of the strategy, the establishment of a new national open data portal has been started and the National Data Asset Management Agency (<em>Nemzeti Adatvagyon Ügynökség,</em> NAVÜ) has been established with the main purpose to facilitate and coordinate the reuse of public sector data among public sector bodies. The Agency also provides analysis and information services to public sector bodies. With the establishment of the Agency, the proper institutional background outlined in the strategy has been successfully created. </p><p>Finally, the planned legislative changes will facilitate and support the implementation of the Public Data Act and will provide the legal framework to the functioning of the Agency and the reuse of PSI.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>Central Authentication Agent</p><p>The Central Authentication Agent building block supports the use of different electronic identification (eID) services, including the Client Gate trusted profile, the national eID card and a partial code telephone authentication.

In addition, with the adoption of the Artificial Intelligence Strategy in September 2020, the strategic and political frameworks for the establishment of the new portal were also defined. In this context, Act No. XCI of 2021 on the National Data Asset set forth the set up of the Open Data Portal to the Hungarian Data Asset Management Agency. The launch is expected in the first half of 2022.</p><p>The aim is to establish a complete and responsible national data management scheme, which includes sharing non-personal data assets created in the public sector and having a significant multiplier effect to exploit the potential economic stimulation effect associated with their wide availability. An additional goal is the creation of an integrated public approach, which can help exploit the benefits of such economic growth considering the investment needed to guarantee such open access to data. Based on this principle, different types of data shall be identified and either made freely available or funnelled into the data market. </p><p>The new Open Data Portal will include the public data cadastre, i.e. a list of databases containing reusable public data in Hungary, and provide a one-stop connection opportunity to the national data assets freely – based on EU legislation. At the same time, it will make the relationship between State and businesses (G2B), and State and clients (G2C), as well as among States (G2G), possible.</p><p class="subtitle">Kormany.hu</p><p>The government of Hungary has an <a href="https://kormany.hu/">official information website</a> which is constantly updated with the latest news, events and multimedia coverage concerning the cabinet activity. The ‘Documents’ section contains information material that the government must publish according to the law and various other publications of interest to citizens. The portal was renewed in 2020.</p><p class="subtitle">Egeszsegugy.gov.hu</p><p>The state-of-the-art IT communication and collaboration platform called <a href="https://e-egeszsegugy.gov.hu/ekapu">Electronic Health Cooperation Service Space (EESZT)</a> enables information systems and health professionals to work together. The services are based on a cloud-based centralised platform and service-oriented architecture (SOA). The system can electronically store information about patients (health status, treatments, etc.) and provides access thereto for doctors, pharmacists, therapists, nurses, etc. working in different institutions to use the same data.</p><p>Since 1 November 2017, all publicly financed healthcare providers (general practitioners, specialist care institutions, etc.) and pharmacies have been obliged to use EESZT services to provide faster, more convenient and more efficient patient care. Since December 2017, everyone has been able to access their eProfile data, event catalogue (i.e. a list of the medical care services administered in the institutions connected to the EESZT), and patient records and documents, including eReferrals and ePrescriptions, after authentication on the Citizen Portal.</p><p>As of 31 December 2021, 6 375 general practitioners (95.7%), 190 public in‑patient healthcare institutions (91.3%), 2 984 pharmacies (96.3%) and 8 798 private healthcare service providers (70.2 %) were connected to the EESZT cloud. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of ePrescriptions has been constantly over 95%, up from 70% before. Also the proportion of telemedicine care increased from 0% before the COVID-19 pandemic to 13% in December 2021. On average, every day 33 000 citizens use the services of the EESZT portal.</p><h3>Subnational Portals</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474990"></a>eMunicipality Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://e-onkormanyzat.gov.hu/">eMunicipality portal</a> (<em>e-önkormányzat Portál</em>) provides a single point of contact to all eGovernment services provided by local governments (more than 99% of the 3 200 Hungarian local governments), using the Municipality ASP service. The Municipality ASP service provides online form templates to be published by the municipalities themselves, while the portal provides access to these services, such as eIdentification, eAuthentication, eDelivery, pre-filling of personal data, follow-up of cases, etc. ePayment was also introduced in March 2020 following an ongoing pilot with a dozen municipalities. The portal is aligned with the Magyarorszag.hu portal in terms of design and Single Sign On is provided for the two Portals.</p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Superfast Internet Programme</p><p>The <a href="https://kifu.gov.hu/szip">Superfast Internet Programme</a> was started in 2015 with the goal of providing at least 30 Mbps broadband connection in every part of Hungary. As part of the programme, 500 000 new network termination points were established by the end of 2018, with further developments under way. </p><p>The Superfast Internet Programme 2.0 was launched in January 2019, aiming to further develop the networks, raise the capacity to at least 100 Mbps available anywhere in the country and further develop optical networks with gigabit capabilities to expand the gigabit broadband network coverage.</p><p class="subtitle">National Telecommunication Backbone Network</p><p>The <a href="https://nisz.hu/hu/projektek/nemzeti-tÃ¡vkÃ¶zlÃ©si-gerinchÃ¡lÃ³zat-ntg-fejlesztÃ©se">National Telecommunication Backbone Network (NTG)</a> is a secure<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>extensive country-wide broadband network forming the basic infrastructure of electronic government in Hungary. Launched in 2012 with the upgrade of the former Electronic Government Backbone (EKG), launched in 2004, this high-speed network connects the 19 county seats with Budapest, providing the central administration, as well as regional institutions, with a secured and monitored communication infrastructure, supporting data communication, internet access, electronic mail, government intranet, and other services.</p><p class="subtitle">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><p>Hungary uses the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/testa_en">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA)</a> network as the main cross-border infrastructure to communicate digitally among EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>Central Government Service Bus</p><p>The <a href="https://idomsoft.hu/rolunk/termekeink/kkszb/">Hungarian Central Government Service Bus (KKSZB)</a> is an interoperability platform that aims to ensure a service-oriented and standardised connection between national base registries and the different specific public administration information systems by unifying communication methods. More specifically, the KKSZB makes it possible to connect systems with different technological, operational and integrational levels, as well as to reduce redundant data storage and data integrity errors resulting from former practice. That way, the KKSZB ensures electronic communication, interoperability and secure data exchange of authentic data among public administrative authorities.</p><p>The KKSZB may be joined as service provider and client at the same time, making it technically possible for applications targeted at citizens and businesses to reach all services provided by the connected service providers via the KKSZB, as long as they have permission to do so.</p><p>The total number of data exchange transactions via the KKSZB was around 60 million per month in 2021. Since the same year the connection of private service providers has also been possible, with 39 private services connected in live environment. Compared to the last reported year, 87 additional organisations have been connected to the KKSZB. As a result, 205 organisations are now using the platform to provide data exchange services and 356 services related to base registries are available, including most of the 27 registries enumerated by Government Decree 451/2016 (XII 19) on the Detailed Rules for Electronic Administration (i.e. the implementing decree of the eAdministration Act).</p><p class="subtitle">Municipality ASP</p><p>Following the successful <a href="https://alkalmazaskozpont.asp.lgov.hu/">Municipality ASP</a> pilot project carried out in 2015–2016, with approximately 100 municipalities involved, the nationwide expansion of the central application service provider for municipalities was launched in 2016 (Municipality ASP 2.0 project) and finished in 2020. As of January 2019, practically all 3 197 local governments of Hungary were connected to the service. </p><p>The goal of Municipality ASP is to provide modern, integrated and cost-effective state‑of-the-art IT solutions for local governments based on the application service provider’s central hardware and software infrastructure, fostering standardised internal operation of local governments and a common platform-based provision of local eGovernment services to citizens and businesses. The service provides integrated back-office systems (financial management software, municipal tax software, document management software, industrial and commercial management software, property cadastre, eAdministration web portal and online form management) for the daily tasks of municipalities, as well as client-side eGovernment services, on a single platform for 99% of all municipalities.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Client Gate</p><p>Hungary has had a comprehensive central identification solution (<a href="https://ugyfelkapu.magyarorszag.hu/">Client Gate</a>) for the identification of citizens for electronic transactions between public authorities and citizens since April 2005. However, a comprehensive solution for the identification of citizens in electronic transactions between public authorities is still lacking. The Client Gate is capable of identifying citizens for any public authority that connects to it.</p><p class="subtitle">Central Authentication Agent</p><p>In January 2016, a new central identification solution, the <a href="https://kau.gov.hu/informacio/kau">Central Authentication Agent</a>, was launched, supporting the use of different electronic identification and authentication services, including the already existing Client Gate and the newly introduced national eID card, as well as the partial code telephone authentication. According to current plans, eIDAS authentication will be made available soon.</p><p class="subtitle">eIDSince February 2018, eServices already integrated with the Central Authentication Agent service can be accessed via eID with the use of the <a href="https://eszemelyi.hu/">Hungarian eID card</a>. In January 2021, the number of valid eID cards issued since the launch in 2016 reached 5.4 million and the number of Client Gate accounts surpassed 4.5 million. Furthermore, the Hungarian eIDAS node is under development and the preparation for the notification of the Hungarian eID means (eID card) is also in progress. </p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474994"></a><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>Public Procurement Legislation</p><p>Public procurement and electronic procurement issues are controlled and managed by one Ministry in Hungary. The <a href="https://kozbeszerzes.hu/torveny/act-cxliii-of-2015-on-public-procurement/">Public Procurement Act </a>and its <a href="https://kozbeszerzes.hu/cikkek/kozbeszerzesi-torveny-es-kapcsolodo-jogszabalyok">implementing decrees</a> are prepared by the Office of the Prime Minister, which is also responsible for the eProcurement policy. The monitoring of public procurement is carried out by the Office of the Prime Minister (in procurement procedures financed both by domestic budget and EU funds) and the Public Procurement Authority, subordinated to the Parliament (monitoring of contract and award notices, etc.).</p><p class="subtitle">System for eProcurement Infrastructure</p><p>The use of a single national eProcurement solution, the <a href="https://ekr.gov.hu/">EKR</a>, is mandated by the Public Procurement Act for all contracting authorities and contracting entities in public procurement procedures both below and above EU public procurement thresholds. The EKR is operated by <a href="https://nekszt.hu/">NEKSZT Ltd.</a>, a State-owned company under the control of the Office of the Prime Minister.</p><p>The EKR was developed in late 2017 and from 1 January to 14 April 2018 was used on a voluntary basis. However, eProcurement through the EKR has become compulsory for all contracting authorities since 15 April 2018 (though central purchasing bodies may partially use their own platforms). At that point, the paper-based administration of procurements ceased.</p><p class="subtitle">Online Invoice System </p><p>Since July 2018, <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/">eInvoicing</a> has become obligatory for transactions including an output VAT of more than HUF 100 000 (approximately EUR 320) between domestic taxpayers. In July 2020, the amount of output VAT was reduced to HUF 0, with all invoices issued between domestic taxpayers being exchanged through the available system. </p><p>In January 2021, the obligation of sending invoice data was extended to all kinds of invoices issued by domestic taxpayers, but taxpayers had an additional three months to prepare themselves for fulfilling the obligation without any sanction. For this purpose, the National Tax and Customs Administration (NTCA) developed and launched a central <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/home">Online Invoice System</a> connected to the financial management software or the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system of businesses via machine‑to‑machine interface. In case of paper invoices, data must be provided manually using the online service within five days, also encouraging businesses to turn to the use of eInvoicing. The NTCA also provides an online invoicing solution free of charge, mainly for SMEs, that can be used to issue eInvoices as well as paper invoices, and automatically sends the invoice data to the NTCA, regardless of the amount of output VAT. To promote and encourage eInvoicing and digital administration, in May 2020 this free online invoicing programme was made available through a mobile app, also helping to reduce administrative steps. </p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing in Public Procurement</p><p>To comply with Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement, since 18 April 2019 the Public Procurement Act has been requiring contracting authorities to receive and process invoices which comply with the relevant European standard. The Public Procurement Act does not clarify further the means to process invoices, leaving it to the contracting authorities to choose the method of transmission and processing.</p><p>A so-called eInvoicing module is also available in the EKR, enabling to verify whether an invoice complies with the European standard EN 16931-1:2017 and the syntax list published by the European Commission in the Official Journal of the EU. The eInvoicing module can help contracting authorities to decide whether they have a legal obligation to receive and process a specific invoice or not.</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>Electronic Payment and Settlement System</p><p><a href="https://www.nisz.hu/hu/efer-â-elektronikus-fizetÃ©si-Ã©s-elszÃ¡molÃ¡si-rendszer">NISZ Zrt</a>., as the provider of the Electronic Payment and Settlement System (EFER), provides an electronic payment service for both electronic and traditional paper-based procedures. EFER is a central electronic payment service (with an associated settlement system) that allows customers to fulfil their payment obligations to electronic administration bodies using a bank card, a virtual bank card or an internet bank. Furthermore, it allows for a single transaction to be used to pay fees related to a given case but payable on a different basis, as well as for the paid amount to be cleared to the target accounts. </p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474997"></a>Cross-border platforms</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Personal Data and Address Registry</p><p>As the most important base registry, the <a href="https://www.nyilvantarto.hu/hu/adatszolgaltatas_szemelyi">Personal Data and Address Registry</a>, maintained by the Ministry of the Interior, is a public official registry that contains and certifies the personal and notification addresses specified by law for registered citizens, as well as any changes thereto. The role of the registry is to collect and manage the data and changes specified in Act LXVI of 1992 on the Registration of Citizens’ Personal Data and Addresses, to issue documents and to provide data on them to those entitled under the act.

To protect personal data in line with the strict Hungarian privacy rules prohibiting the use of a single identification number for individuals, the Association Registry does not include any personal information or other sectoral ID, using encrypted contact codes instead. Currently, the number of items contained in the Association Registry is 13.5 million, with 8.2 million generated as encrypted contact code based on ID cards (ID items) and 2.8 million generated as encrypted contact code based on passports (passport items).</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Register of Registers</p><p>The <a href="https://euf.gov.hu/">EÜF</a>, in accordance with the eAdministration Act and the related implementing regulations, shall manage and publish the Register of Information Sources (based on the content of the information transfer rules submitted), and the List of Data and Document Titles. The purpose of the Register of Information Sources is to identify redundant administrative burdens in public services, as well as to enable citizens and other organisations to know what public administration organisation keeps what kind of records and under what procedure, and how to claim data.</p><p>The <a href="https://e-ugyintezes.onyf.hu/enyenyi/LoginPage.aspx">Electronic Register of Registers (NyENy)</a> is a registration system where (i) information transfer rules can be prepared and recorded; and (ii) the Register of Information Sources, and the List of Data and Document Titles can be managed. The NyENy helps to develop the interpretation of standard definitions, to simplify the process of administration, to extend the recent information system techniques and technological solutions, and to guide clients (citizens or representatives of public services).</p><h2>Emerging Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle">AI-assisted building block services</p><p>Following the regulatory measures supporting the uptake of AI-based solutions by the public sector mentioned above, the following three AI-assisted building block services developed by the Ministry of the Interior became available for public administration reuse: the AI-assisted voice generator service (text-to-speech), the AI-assisted voice description service (speech-to-text) and the AI-assisted communication assistant (chatrobot), a software solution capable of conducting conversation and interactive communication very similar to human dialogue in a collaborative manner automatically, with or without human intervention, through a machine self-learning process. All three AI-assisted services use deep learning to learn continuously in a supervised way. The new central AI-based building block services will be offered by the GDC, thus ensuring the highest security requirements for closed electronic information systems, so that services used by the client will not be available to third parties. The services will be available for public administration organisations through the KKSZB.</p><p>These services will further increase the number of cases that can be handled in a contact-free manner without personal appearance, and will guarantee that oral statements made via the service will be considered the same as written ones. </p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Big data </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Cloud computing</h3><p class="subtitle">Government Data Centre</p><p>Avoiding using external (public and hybrid) cloud services in the public administration is a key element of the Hungarian government’s IT policy. This is why the Hungarian government started to develop the GDC. The GDC is a geo-redundant data centre that provides central IT infrastructure capable of providing a cloud-based service environment for government, public administration and public services. The service provider of the GDC is the State-owned NISZ Zrt., designated by law and controlled by the Ministry of the Interior. As a result of last years’ development, the share of the cloud-enabled data centre capacity provided by NISZ Zrt. is 24.6% of the total governmental server room infrastructure.
