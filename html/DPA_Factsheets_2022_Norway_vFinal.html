The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-282.png" alt="35-282.png" /></p><p><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Norway in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-318.x-emf" alt="35-318.x-emf" /></p><p><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Norway’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall very good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). The only area below the EU average concerns Principle 2 (Openness). In this context, the country should further ensure a level playing field for open source software and demonstrate active and fair consideration of using open source software, taking into account the total cost of ownership of the solution (Recommendation 3). Other areas of improvements are concentrated in Principles 7 (Inclusion and accessibility) and 9 (Multilingualism) and for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure that public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) and the implementation of information systems and IT architecture that caters for multiple languages based on the needs of the end user in the design of European public services (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p><img src="img/35-332.x-emf" alt="35-332.x-emf" /></p><p><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Norwegian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall very good performance with scores of 4 for all layers. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are in the area of interoperability governance; integrated public service governance, and organisational interoperability. More specifically, the overall score of 3 for Norway in Recommendation 22, stating that public administrations should use a structured, objective and transparent approach when choosing standards and specifications, could be improved. The same can be said for the overall score of 3 for Recommendation 29, stating that public administrations should clarify and formalise organisational relationships for establishing and operating European public services. However, it is important to note that while greater efforts could be focussed on Recommendation 22 and 29, the lower score of 3 does not negatively impact the overall interoperability governance score for Norway.</p><p><img src="img/35-348.x-emf" alt="35-348.x-emf" /></p><p><a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Norway’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a very good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with all criteria. It is interesting to note that Norway has an above-EU average score of 4 for the implementation of recommendations associated with security and privacy and external information sources and services. However, some improvements could be made in implementing recommendations related to catalogues. By putting in place a catalogue of public services, data and interoperability solutions, each with common models to describe them (Recommendation 44), Norway’s overall score on catalogues could be improved to reach the maximum score of 4.</p><p>Additional information on Norway’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity:</strong> indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services:</strong> indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers:</strong> indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

St. 27 (2015-2016) in the parliamentary year 2015-2016. The Digital Agenda has two key objectives: ensuring a user-centric and efficient public administration and achieving value creation and inclusion with digital services. </p><p>The newly adopted strategy has five key priorities:</p><ul><li>A user centric focus;</li><li>ICT should constitute a significant input factor for innovation and productivity;</li><li>Strengthened digital competence and inclusion;</li><li>An effective digitisation of the public sector; and</li><li>Sound data protection and information security.</li></ul><p>The effective use of ICT is essential to ensure continued economic growth and a high level of employment in Norway. Through the purposeful use of ICT, the policy aims to provide the public with a growing number of digital services. Digital self-service solutions will help improve service quality, availability and flexibility for users.</p><p>Advanced use of ICT in business and public sectors depends on a good infrastructure (broadband) and a sufficient knowledge of ICT within the population. It is important that technological solutions are accessible to everyone, including the visually and hearing impaired. In addition, to achieve the objectives of ICT policy, the research and development of ICT and advanced ICT skills needs to be strengthened.</p><p class="subtitle">One Digital Public Sector: Digital Strategy for the Public Sector 2019–2025</p><p>The <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/one-digital-public-sector/id2653874/">Digital Strategy for the Public Sector</a>, launched in June 2019, establishes the common goals and focus areas for digitalisation activities towards 2025. It supports digital transformation throughout the public sector. The strategy’s main measures focus on a user-centric service development and more efficient and coordinated utilisation of common IT solutions. This is achieved by developing a common ecosystem for digital cooperation in the public sector. The strategy requires that cybersecurity be integrated into common IT solution services development, operation and management, in accordance with the objectives of the National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway. Therefore, the main goals for 2025 aim to: </p><ul><li>Achieve the digitalisation of the public sector in a transparent, inclusive and trustworthy way;</li><li>Perform more tasks digitally as well as the delivery of services;</li><li>Encourage citizens, businesses and voluntary organisations to communicate digitally with the public sector;</li><li>Exploit the sharing and using of data to create user-friendly services and to promote value creation for businesses; </li><li>Help local and central government agencies to develop their services based on a common digital ecosystem for cooperation; and</li><li>Help local and central government agencies to gain from digitalisation in a systematic manner.</li></ul><p>The Action Plan accompanying this strategy is coordinated by the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital21</p><p><a href="https://digital21.no/">Digital21</a> was initiated by the Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry as a result of recommendations in the industrial report, <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/meld.-st.-27-20162017/id2546209/">Meld.

This white paper includes national principles for sharing and using data.</p><p>The purpose of the white paper is to present the government policy on how to use data as a resource to create value for the private and public sectors. The government wants the country to exploit the opportunities inherent in data for increased value creation, more new jobs across the country, and an efficient public sector. Better utilisation of data is important if Norway is to succeed in the transition to a more sustainable society and a greener economy.</p><p> </p><p>The government's ambition is to increase data sharing within the business community and between the public and private sectors. Although data make up an ever-larger share of value creation in most Norwegian industries and sectors today, the business community must become even better at utilising its own data and to share data within established value chains. Increased digitalisation and better data utilization will be important if Norwegian businesses are to remain competitive nationally and internationally. </p><p> </p><p>Public data is of value for businesses in that they can be used in new contexts, interconnected with different data and contribute to innovation, new services and products. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services<a id="_Toc1474955"></a></h3><p class="subtitle">New Strategy for eID</p><p>The Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development has decided to put in place a<a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/aktuelt/alle-skal-ha-tilgang-til-sikker-elektronisk-id/id2832399/"> new Strategy for Electronic Identification (eID</a>), due to be published later in 2022.</p><p>The main goals for eID and trust services are laid out in the <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/one-digital-public-sector/id2653874/">One Digital Public Sector</a> strategy.

All groups, including foreign nationals without a Norwegian national identity number, and children and adolescents, should be able to obtain an eID at the level they need. Individuals who are unable to act digitally themselves, must have the opportunity to be represented by a proxy. Provisions must therefore be made for the use of digital authorisations and digital consent.

No specific time frame was applied as the government committed to progressively adjust it in line with technological and social developments. It states that Norway should take the lead in developing and using AI while respecting individual rights and freedoms.</p><p>The AI Strategy takes as a starting point the fact that Norway is well positioned for succeeding with AI. Indeed, Norway has:</p><ul><li>A high level of public trust in both business and public sectors;</li><li>A digitally competent population and business sector;</li><li>An excellent infrastructure and high-quality registry data that span over many decades;</li><li>Well-developed e-Governance and public agencies that have come a long way with digitalisation and that have the capacity and expertise to experiment with new technologies; and</li><li>Tripartite cooperation between employers, unions and government, which facilitates cooperation when restructuring is necessary.</li></ul><p>The strategy goes on to highlight that:</p><ul><li>AI developed and used in Norway should be built on ethical principles, and respect human rights and democracy;</li><li>Research, development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) in Norway should promote responsible and trustworthy AI;</li><li>Development and use of AI in Norway should safeguard the integrity and privacy of the individual; and</li><li>Cybersecurity should be built into the development, operation and administration of systems that use AI.</li></ul><p>Supervisory authorities should make sure that AI systems in their areas of supervision are operated in accordance with the principles for responsible and trustworthy use of AI. </p><p>The strategy outlines the importance of regulatory sandbox initiatives as tools in the Norwegian public administration. One example is the ongoing cooperation between the <a href="https://www.arkivverket.no/en">National Archival Service</a> and the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency, where participants in the initiative are being challenged to find new and innovative ways of combining documentation management, freedom of information and personal data protection. Another example is the cooperation between the <a href="https://www.datatilsynet.no/en/">Data Protection Agency</a> and the <a href="https://www.nav.no/en/home">Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV)</a>, which aims to stimulate innovation of ethical and responsible AI, with extra attention being paid to personal data protection.

Currently there are 10 connected administrations in Norway.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Datafabrikken</p><p>In October 2020, the Norwegian government agreed to allocate NOK 16 million to the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency to establish a <a href="https://www.digdir.no/digitalisering-og-samordning/gront-lys-datafabrikken/1985">Data Factory (<em>Datafabrikken</em>)</a> in cooperation with <a href="https://digitalnorway.com/">DigitalNorway</a>, starting in 2021. The project aims to make it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to take part in the computer-driven economy. It will provide expertise on data sharing and data connection, and support a number of government strategies, including the government's Digitalisation Strategy and National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence.</p><p>In <em>Datafabrikken</em>, providers and users of data will have access to functions and resources that are necessary to create digital services and new industries based on data. <em>Datafabrikken</em> will mediate data available from various sources and help small and medium-sized enterprises and start-up companies to obtain relevant data and support to process the data. The data disseminated through <em>Datafabrikken</em> will come from private businesses and public enterprises.</p><p class="subtitle">Reference Architectures for exchange of data and documents</p><p>The Norwegian Digitalisation Agency has published <a href="https://doc.difi.no/nasjonal-arkitektur/nab_referanse_arkitekturer/#_aktuelle_referansearkitekturer">reference architectures</a> for three general patterns of data and document exchange: lookup, delivery and notification.

Examples of such services include: applying for a loan from the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund; applying to upper secondary school; changing a tax return; changing a family doctor; changing an address in the National Population Register. It is used by 2.6 million Norwegians. MinID makes use of the <a href="http://www.difi.no/digital-forvaltning/felles-it-losninger-fra-difi/id-porten">ID-Gateway</a>, the common platform for eID in the Norwegian public sector.</p><p>Responsibility lies with the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency.</p><p>In the wake of the COVID-19 public health crisis, many foreign nationals had to leave their jobs in Norway and return home. Some of these people were entitled to unemployment benefits, which need to be accessed with an eID. However, many of these foreign workers did not have such an eID. In order to remedy this, the MinID was further developed with a <a href="http://eid.difi.no/en/minid/passport">MinID Passport</a>. The MinID Passport allows users to scan their own passport and take pictures with facial recognition in order to verify their identity, thus allowing employees abroad to access the unemployment benefits they are entitled to. In addition, the technical solution is a breakthrough as a new method of issuing eIDs, in that users do not have to show up physically to get one.</p><p class="subtitle">Buypass, Commfides and BankID eID solutions</p><p><a href="http://eid.difi.no/en/buypass-id">Buypass</a>ID, <a href="http://eid.difi.no/en/commfides">Commfides</a> and <a href="http://eid.difi.no/en/bankid">BankID</a> enable citizens to access public services that require a medium and high level of security, as well as services that require the highest level of security. This applies to health information and the signing of documents, among other services.

The directory was established following the merging of data.norge.no and the National Data Catalogue, making it easier to create user-friendly services for citizens and ensuring better access to data for public and private enterprises. The catalogue addresses the need to discover, evaluate and access data. The directory is built on a flexible architecture, offering solutions for both mature and less mature data providers and consumers. Furthermore, the directory was developed with an open-source code, allowing users to spot missing functionalities and develop them on their own or ask the Digitalisation Agency for cooperation in creating them. </p><p class="subtitle">eInnsyn</p><p>The common solution <a href="https://einnsyn.no/sok?sort=">eInnsyn</a>, based on the previous Electronic Public Records (OEP) solution, is a tool that allows central government agencies to publicise their public records online.

The success of programme’s solutions depends on extensive access to base registries. </p><p>Last but not least, the tax authorities of Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden are connected to and operate the Nordic tax portal, <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://www.nordisketax.net/&amp;data=04|01||f0681eb51a494cb2f5d908da0cca06fd|008e560f08af4ceca056b35447503991|1|0|637836359081278568|Unknown|TWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0=|3000&amp;sdata=OjWay5V9NlBrpbETEMjYLXAbiWpT8xSX7JIbPgDM0Ao=&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Nordisk eTax</a>. The portal serves people who live in one Nordic country but have income or assets in another Nordic country. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">KOSTRA</p><p>The Municipality-State-Reporting <a href="http://www.ssb.no/kostra/">KOSTRA</a> system allows municipalities and counties to report electronically to the State data on the economy, schools, health, culture, the environment, social services, public housing, technical services and transport, and communication. KOSTRA focuses on two main purposes: providing better information about the municipalities at central and local government level and striving for more efficient reporting.</p><p class="subtitle">National Population Register</p><p>Information on everyone living in Norway is gathered for tax, electoral and population analysis purposes by local tax assessment offices. This information is registered in the <a href="http://www.skatteetaten.no/en/Person/National-Registry/">National Population Register</a> (<em>Folkeregisteret</em>) and is overseen by the Directorate of Taxes (S<em>kattedirektoratet</em>). Information from the National Register (e.g. names, addresses, citizenship, identification numbers, employment and civil status of individuals) is only accessible by authorised public sector offices. However, members of the public may apply for access to information from the National Registry for legal purposes. Applications for information from the National Registry are processed by local tax assessment offices and the Office of the National Register. </p><p class="subtitle">Altinn</p><p>A common technical platform, called <a href="https://www.altinn.no/en/">Altinn</a>, was created for the public sector to exchange data from base registries with the purposes of prefilling digital forms, reporting to the public sector and for lookup-services in the base registries, e.g. the National Population Registry and the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities. Altinn, now run by the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency, contains an authorisation module that governs access to services by the role of individuals and businesses. The businesses roles, e.g. director, board member, accountant, are managed in the Entity Registry. The Norwegian Entity Registry (or Central Coordination Register for Legal Entities, CCR) contains information about both businesses and public entities (meant as governmental agencies). A new registry, currently under development within the Brønnøysund Registry Centre, will add authorisation by proxy. This will furthermore extend the authorisation component in Altinn. The authorisation component also manages data sharing with user consent. Moreover, Altinn maintains the Norwegian metadata repository SERES, which is a standard for the design of web forms in Altinn.</p><p>In June 2020, <a href="https://altinn.github.io/docs/ny-funksjonalitet/prosjekter/tjenester30/">Altinn 3.0</a> was released. The end-of-life for the technology upon which Altinn was previously built, namely Microsoft Inpath, was announced. The development of Altinn 3.0 was therefore crucial to guarantee its future. As part of Altinn 3.0, <a href="https://www.altinndigital.no/altinn-studio/">Altinn Studio</a> was developed. Altinn Studio can be used to develop and run everything from simple forms to complete applications. This solution is based on open-source components and has been developed to allow service owners to develop modern applications on a scalable and future-oriented infrastructure for citizens and businesses. </p><p class="subtitle">Land Registry and Cadastre</p><p>The <a href="https://kartverket.no/en/about-the-norwegian-mapping-authority/">Norwegian Mapping Authority</a> is responsible of the Land Registry and the Cadastre. The Land Registry, serving as a central database, is fully digitised. The Norwegian Mapping Authority does registration of documents, data checking and recording. The Norwegian Cadastre is a public registry of real properties, including information on buildings and addresses. The Cadastre is administered and technically hosted by the Norwegian Mapping Authority. Municipalities undertake cadastral surveying. These two central databases are technically linked, providing an integrated online service to users.</p><p class="subtitle">Business Registry</p><p>The <a href="https://www.brreg.no/">Brønnøysund Register Centre (<em>Brønnøysundregistrene</em>)</a> is a Norwegian government body responsible for the management of numerous public registers in Norway and is subordinate to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries. Among the registries that the authority governs are the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities, the Registry of Business Enterprises, the European Business Registry, the Registry of Company Accounts, the Registry of the Reporting Obligations of Enterprises, the Registry of Mortgaged Moveable Property, the Registry of Bankruptcies, the Registry of Marriage Settlements, and the Registry of Political Parties. </p><p class="subtitle">Contact and Reservation Register</p><p>The <a href="https://www.norge.no/en/update-your-contact-information">Contact and Reservation Register</a> is a Norwegian base register containing information on citizens’ digital contact data, e.g. mobile phone number and e-mail address. It also contains information on citizens’ preferences in terms digital mailbox, language used for digital communication and willingness to receive mail digitally. It is run by the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency.</p><h2>Emerging Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Big data</h3><p class="subtitle">eHealth Big Data Analysis</p><p>A platform for big data analysis within the health sector is under construction.
