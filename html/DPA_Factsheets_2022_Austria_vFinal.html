The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below. </p><p><img src="img/35-183.png" alt="35-183.png" /> </p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021 </a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Austria in 2021.</p><p><img src="img/35-224.x-emf" alt="35-224.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Austria’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average in the Principles 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Although Austria scores at the European average for all the other Principles, the two areas of improvement could be related to Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and Principle 9 (Multilingualism), where Austria received the score of 3. This is due to an incomplete implementation of the corresponding recommendations. Indeed, measures to ensure that Austria’s national interoperability framework and strategy area aligned with the EIF should be improved, as well as measures to further use information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service. These measures would help the country reach the maximum score of 4 in all Principles of the EIF.</p><p><img src="img/35-238.x-emf" alt="35-238.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Austrian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance. The remaining potential area of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2, is the interoperability governance. Particularly, the scores of 2 for Austria in Recommendation 24, stating that Austria should actively participate in standardisation work relevant to the country’s needs to ensure its requirements are met, lowers the overall interoperability governance result for Austria, as well as Recommendation 22, which encourages the use of a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assessing and selecting standards and specifications, hinders the country’s results with regard to interoperability governance.</p><p><img src="img/35-254.x-emf" alt="35-254.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Austria’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an overall good performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations, much aligned with the EU average and also scoring above the EU average in the area of Catalogues. Some improvements to reach to score of 4 in all areas can be made, particularly by in better implementing recommendation 45, which encourages countries to use external information sources and services while developing public services, as well as recommendation 47 which encourages the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services. </p><p>Additional information on Austria’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The approval of the <a href="https://neu.ref.wien.gv.at/at.gv.wien.ref-live/documents/20189/79767/Austrian_Interoperability_Framework__AIF-1.0.0_.pdf/4bc872de-2f08-4749-b7b9-6aa341ad8ad7?version=1.0">Austrian Interoperability Framework (AIF)</a> in January 2015 set a mutual goal to guide, promote and support the delivery of Austrian public services by fostering cross-border, cross-organisation and cross-sector interoperability. The framework addressed issues such as its underlying principles, the conceptual model for public services, the interoperability levels, the interoperability agreements and the interoperability governance.</p><p>More specifically, the purpose of the AIF was: </p><ul><li>to promote and support the delivery of Austrian public services by fostering cross-border, cross-organisation and cross-sector interoperability; </li><li>to guide public administrations in their work to provide Austrian public services to businesses and citizens; and</li><li>to complement and tie together the various Organisational Interoperability Frameworks (OIFs) at Austrian level. </li></ul><p>This non-technical document was addressed to all those involved in defining, designing and implementing Austrian public services. The AIF should be taken into account when making decisions on Austrian public services that support the implementation of Austrian policy initiatives.

The federal government has identified the Once-Only principle, and herewith the reduction of administrative burdens for citizens as well as for companies, as a key issue to be addressed in this legislative period (2020–2024). This includes several measures to alleviate the burden of information obligations on businesses and citizens, that should provide their data only once to the administration.</p><p>Thanks to the smart use of back-office data available to a growing number of public authorities, it became possible to provide citizens with ‘no-stop’ procedures in which visits to or contacts with authorities were eliminated entirely. For example, Austria grants a family allowance for which no application is necessary, i.e., citizens automatically receive the benefits that they are entitled to without having to complete or send in any form. Since the implementation in May 2015, families have automatically received the allowance granted at the birth of a child without having to apply for it. Overall, an estimated 80 000 families a year benefit from this ‛no-stop shop’ solution.</p><p>At the same time, the Austrian government places strong emphasis on improving the framework conditions for companies. This includes taking concrete measures to reduce the information obligations for companies, thus alleviating the administrative burden. </p><p>The setup of an Information Hub (RSV) for the automated exchange of data and evidence between public authorities on a national level and on EU Level is planned by 2023 (Single Digital Gateway Regulation). An information obligation database provides an overview of already available data of public authorities. This instrument aims to foster the detection and elimination of redundancies in business reporting and acts as a basis for new reforms and data optimization. </p><p>The present amendment of the Business Service Portal Act - that entered into force on 27 July 2021 - provides the necessary legal basis for the information hub and the overall technical system allowing for the automated data exchange and implementation of the Once-Only principle.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>Open Government Data</p><p>Fostering the provision and use of open government data to increase transparency and create new opportunities for companies was a major cornerstone of the Austrian government programme ‘<a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/_em_daten/_wzo/2020/01/02/200102-1510_regierungsprogramm_2020_gesamt.pdf">In Responsibility for Austria - Government Programme 2020–2024</a>’.

Thus, certain information (birth certificates, proof of citizenship, proof of residency or documents from the Commercial Registry) need no longer be provided by the person concerned but can, with the person’s consent or with legal authorisation, be directly requested by the authority from an electronic register. The public authority’s responsibility to enable queries in their registers in no way increases their right to release information, since they are based solely on existing authorisations.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474963"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474964"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc973049"></a><a id="_Toc1035606"></a><a id="_Toc1474965"></a>Constitutional Law on Access to Information</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1987_286/ERV_1987_286.pdf">Constitutional Law on Access to Information</a> (Auskunftspflichtgesetz) became effective on 1 January 1988.

However, it did not permit citizens to access documents, but only to receive answers from the government on the content of information.

In particular, this concerns regulations or specifications in the areas of trust service providers, supervision, formal aspects, liability and penalties in the event of non-compliance with the specifications of the eIDAS Regulation. Although the SVG applies to all trust services, the creation, validation and preservation of electronic signatures continue to be the core. It therefore continues to be possible to sign contracts electronically with an electronic signature with the same effect as if the contract were signed by hand. In addition, an important step for consumer protection was made with the SVG: companies can no longer exclude in hidden clauses the acceptance of the electronic signature and thus, for example, prevent electronic terminations of subscriptions.</p><p>The last amendments to the act, made on 17 May 2018 and 27 December 2018, regarded the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc973057"></a><a id="_Toc1035614"></a><a id="_Toc1474967"></a>Security of Network and Information Systems Act</p><p><a id="_Hlk6320079"></a>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20010536">Security of Network and Information Systems Act</a> was adopted on 28 December 2018 in order to transpose the European <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&amp;uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG">Directive concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems (NIS Directive)</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Data Protection Act</p><p>The Austrian <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.pdf">Data Protection Act</a> (<em>Datenschutzgesetz</em> 2000; DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999) came into effect on 1 January 2000.

In 2008 and 2009, the first two privately run delivery services that complied with legal regulations and technical specifications for electronic delivery became operational. Currently, there are <a href="https://www.bmdw.gv.at/Services/ElektronischeZustellung/Allgemeine-Information-zur-eZustellung.html">five privately run delivery services</a> on the market with 3.3 million deliveries in 2021. </p><p>In the future, official notifications will mainly be sent by electronic means. The new electronic delivery system - which can be seen as an evolution of the old system - was launched on 1 December 2019. The new system brings many advantages to citizens, businesses and public authorities. Just like the letterbox in the paper world, recipients only need one system to receive official notifications as well as private mail in the electronic world. This central system is called MyPostbox (<em>meinpostkorb</em>). The revised electronic delivery offers great saving potential for public authorities, citizens and businesses (e.g. postage costs, printing costs and time). The display module MyPostbox bundles documents from different delivery systems into a common view and allows for a single point of registration.

An electronic file is created for every written request requiring an answer and every internal project of possible future interest. In this way, every procedure can be easily audited anytime by viewing the file. At the federal level ELAK means that many procedures can now be conducted more efficiently facilitating inter-administrative transactions, which can now be processed using just one medium. The introduction of ELAK brought about significant savings. At the beginning of 2020, a new Electronic File System was launched with further useful features (e.g. team rooms for cross-sector collaboration with private sector partners) and a modernised design.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc973109"></a><a id="_Toc1035670"></a><a id="_Toc973118"></a><a id="_Toc1035679"></a><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Portal Group </p><p>The <a href="https://www.digitales.oesterreich.gv.at/portalverbund">Portal Group</a> is a link-up of administrative portals and the basic infrastructure for the authentication and authorisation of public sector employees when accessing restricted online resources.

For this reason, the software is continually maintained in a collaborative process and upgraded to fulfil new requirements. For this purpose, the eGovLabs platform was created for the developer community, so that a structured cooperation can be established when it comes to feature and change requests, error reports and enhancements. The modules and all their versions, including the source code, are available on this open-source repository. In order to underline the European dimension and cross-border usability, eGovLabs was shifted to the EU <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/">Joinup</a> open-source platform.</p><p class="subtitle">Cybersecurity Quiz App</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bmdw.gv.at/Presse/Archiv/2020/Juni-2020/Cyber-Security-Quiz-App-.html">Cybersecurity Quiz App</a> was developed to strengthen the digital skills of Austrians in the field of cybersecurity.

Austria also participates in the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) and was one of the first member countries to put a national EBSI node in operation. </p><p>Most of the Austrian administrative bodies are already dealing with blockchain technology and potential fields of application to a certain extent. There are considerations to use blockchain technology in many areas of the Austrian public administration. The Anti-fraud Tax and Customs Office, for example, is planning to implement a technology which will be able to comprehend the payment flows of crypto currencies. To this end, a software which will be able to break-up the blockchain technology (or at least parts of it), will be implemented.</p><h3>Big data</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date. </p><h3>Cloud computing </h3><p class="subtitle">Cloud Computing - Ö-Cloud</p><p>The <a href="https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/initiativen/verwaltung/verwaltungs-projekte/OECloud.html">Austrian Cloud (Ö-Cloud)</a> initiative was launched on 10 June 2020.
