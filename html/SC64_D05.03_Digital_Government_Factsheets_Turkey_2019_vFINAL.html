The Circular specifies both the characteristics of the card as well as the project’s implementation process.</p><p>The Citizenship Card, which is actually a smart card, will exclusively contain static information necessary to perform ID verification, but no dynamic data such as health information, address, among other such data. The card will enable ID verification with different credentials such as visual security elements, pin code and biometric data (fingerprint). The biometric data will be held exclusively on the card and will not be stored in a central database. The card is going to replace the currently used national identity cards. In addition, the characteristics of the card enable its usage in any service requiring secure ID verification, such as online eGovernment services, financial transactions, among other services.</p><p>In accordance with the Circular, a three-stage pilot project has already been implemented in the area of social security and health. Completed pilot projects were redesigned once again and another pilot implementation of the eIDs is underway.</p><p>The integration of new generation Citizen Cards with eGovernment Gateway has finished. With this application, citizens can use these cards for authentication and connection to the eGovernment Gateway.</p><p>Applications of the new ID cards started on 14 March 2016, in Kırıkkale. A further application began in 10 pilot cities in October 2016. Since 2017, the new eID cards have been available throughout the country. The new eID cards include a built-in eSignature feature and if the owner gets the qualified eCertificates for secure eSignature. It can be used for access to eGovernment services.</p><p class="subtitle">AKS (<em>Adres Kayıt Sistemi</em> – Address Registration System)</p><p>The <a href="https://adres.nvi.gov.tr/">Address Registration System</a>, abbreviated AKS in Turkish, is a centrally administered system established by the Civil Registration Services Law No. 5490 where up-to-date domicile and other address information of Turkish nationals and foreigners domiciled in Turkey is maintained electronically. </p><p>The system is integrated with the Central Civil Registration System (MERNIS) where records such as the ‘Name, Surname, Mother’s and Father’s Name, Place of Birth and Information on Civil Status Events’ related to the identity of the person are stored and accessed using the Turkish Republic Identity Number (TR Identity Number).</p><p>In this scope, a national address database was established using a standard address form set out by the municipalities and provincial special administrations, following which the address data held on this database was matched with the corresponding personal data using the TR Identity Numbers.</p><p>The system aims to reduce costs and provide faster and more efficient public services, and therefore reduce bureaucratic problems faced by the users of the services.</p><p>Pursuant to the provision contained in the Turkish Civil Code stating that ‘change of a domicile address is subject to the acquirement of another one’, the previous address of the person entered in the AKS is automatically deleted and archived following the declaration of a new domicile address. </p><p>As stated above, a declaration by the person is sufficient for the entry of the new addresses into the system. However, in cases of “a suspicious declaration,” civil registration officials have the power to instigate enquiry and file criminal complaints with the judicial authorities for the imposition of imprisonment and cash fines set out in the Civil Registration Services law. The address change declaration can be done electronically by eSignature. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Public Procurement Platform (EKAP)</p><p>The Public Procurement Authority aims at utilising electronic means to conduct and to improve the process of purchasing goods and services in the public sector through the use of the <a href="https://ekap.kik.gov.tr/EKAP/Default.aspx?ReturnUrl=/EKAP">Electronic Public Procurement Platform</a> (<em>Elektronik Kamu Alımları Platformu</em>), available since the end of 2010.
