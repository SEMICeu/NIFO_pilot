The new Magyarorszag.hu Portal features a more modern design as well as a life-event based approach to publish existing eGovernment services, and it boasts a built-in intelligent online formulary system (iFORM), e-payment service integration, as well as several integrated applets. </p><p>According to the <a href="http://njt.hu/cgi_bin/njt_doc.cgi?docid=193173.316582">eAdministration Act</a>, all public administration bodies providing eGovernment services are obliged to publish their services on the Portal.

The development of the new portal was then started. With the adoption of the Artificial Intelligence Strategy in September 2020, the strategic and political frameworks for the establishment of the new portal have been created.</p><p>The launch of a new open data portal is expected in the first half of 2021. The aim is to establish a complete and responsible national data management scheme, which includes sharing nonpersonal data assets created in the public sector and having a significant multiplier effect to exploit the potential economic stimulation effect associated with their wide availability. An additional goal is the creation of an integrated public approach, which can help exploit the benefits of such economic growth considering the investment needed to guarantee such open access to data. Based on this principle, different types of data shall be identified and either made freely available or funnelled into the data market. The aim is standardised data generation and data format determination, which enable easy access for research and development purposes, and monitoring the use of public data at an organisational level.</p><p>The new public data portal provides a one-stop connection opportunity access to the national data assets freely – based on EU legislation – and, on the other hand, it makes the relationship between the State and businesses (G2B), the State and clients (G2C) and among states (G2G) possible.</p><p class="subtitle">Kormany.hu</p><p>The government of Hungary has an <a href="https://kormany.hu/">official information website</a> which is constantly updated with the latest news, events and multimedia coverage concerning the cabinet activity.

As part of the Programme, 500,000 new network termination points were established by the end of 2018, with further developments under way. The Superfast Internet Programme 2.0 was launched in January 2019, aiming to further develop the networks, raise the capacity to at least 100 Mbps available anywhere in the country, and further develop optical networks with gigabit capabilities to expand the gigabit broadband network coverage.</p><p class="subtitle">National Telecommunication Backbone Network</p><p>The <a href="https://nisz.hu/hu/projektek/nemzeti-tÃ¡vkÃ¶zlÃ©si-gerinchÃ¡lÃ³zat-ntg-fejlesztÃ©se">National Telecommunication Backbone Network (NTG)</a> is a secure<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>extensive country-wide broadband network forming the basic infrastructure of electronic government in Hungary. Launched in 2012 with the upgrade of the former Electronic Government Backbone (EKG), launched in 2004, this high-speed network connects the 19 county seats with Budapest, providing the central administration, as well as regional institutions, with a secured and monitored communication infrastructure, supporting data communication, internet access, electronic mail, government intranet, and other services.</p><p class="subtitle">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><p>Hungary uses the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/testa_en">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</a> (TESTA) network as the main cross border infrastructure to communicate digitally among EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>Central Government Service Bus</p><p>The <a href="https://idomsoft.hu/rolunk/termekeink/kkszb/">Hungarian Central Government Service Bus (KKSZB)</a> is an interoperability platform that aims to ensure a service-oriented and standardised connection between national base registries and the different specific public administration information systems by unifying communication methods. More specifically, the KKSZB makes it possible to connect systems with different technological, operational and integrational levels, as well as to reduce redundant data storage and data integrity errors resulting from former practice. In other words, the KKSZB ensures electronic communication, interoperability and secure data exchange of authentic data among public administrative authorities.</p><p>The KKSZB may be joined as service provider and client at the same time, making it technically possible for applications targeted at citizens and businesses to reach all services provided by the connected service providers via the KKSZB, as long as they have permission to do so.</p><p>On the client side, 570 organisations or services are connected (175 in live environment and 345 in test environment). The number of data exchange transactions has increased from last year´s 42.7 million per month to more than 100 million per month in 2020. Compared to the last reported year, 51 additional organisations have been connected to the KKSZB Central Government Service Bus interoperability platform. As a result, 156 organisations are now using the platform to provide data exchange services, and 171 services related to base registries are now available, including most of the 27 registries enumerated by Government Decree 451/2016 (XII 19) on the Detailed Rules of Electronic Administration (i.e., the implementing decree of the eAdministration Act).</p><p class="subtitle">Municipality ASP</p><p>Following the successful <a href="https://alkalmazaskozpont.asp.lgov.hu/">Municipality ASP</a> pilot project carried out in 2015-2016, with approximately 100 municipalities involved, the nationwide expansion of the central application service provider for municipalities was launched in 2016 (Municipality ASP 2.0 project) and will be finished in 2020. As of January 2019, practically all 3,197 local governments of Hungary were connected to the service. </p><p>The goal of the central ASP for municipalities is to provide modern, integrated and cost-effective state-of-the-art IT solutions for local governments based on the application service provider’s central hardware and software infrastructure, fostering standardised internal operation of local governments and a common platform-based provision of local eGovernment services to citizens and businesses. The service provides integrated back-office systems (financial management software, municipal tax software, document management software, industrial and commercial management software, property cadastre, eAdministration web portal and online form management) for the daily tasks of the municipalities, as well as client side eGovernment services, on a single platform for 99% of all 3,197 municipalities connected.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Client Gate</p><p>Hungary has had a comprehensive central identification solution (<a href="https://ugyfelkapu.magyarorszag.hu/">Client Gate</a>) for the identification of citizens for electronic transactions between public authorities and citizens since April 2005. However, a comprehensive solution for the identification of citizens in electronic transactions between public authorities is still lacking. The Client Gate is capable of identifying citizens for any public authority that connects to it.</p><p class="subtitle">Central Authentication Agent</p><p>In January 2016, a new central identification solution, the <a href="https://kau.gov.hu/informacio/kau">Central Authentication Agent</a>, was launched, supporting the use of different electronic identification and authentication services, including the already existing Client Gate, and the newly introduced national eID card, as well as the partial code telephone authentication. According to current plans, eIDAS authentication will be made available soon.</p><p class="subtitle">eID</p><p>Since February 2018, eServices already integrated with the Central Authentication Agent service can be accessed via electronic identification with the use of the <a href="https://eszemelyi.hu/">Hungarian eID card</a>. The Hungarian eIDAS node is under development. The preparation for the notification of the Hungarian electronic identification means (eID card) is also in progress. In January 2021, the number of valid eID cards issued since the launch in 2016 reached 5.4 million and the number of Client Gate accounts surpassed 4.5 million in January 2021.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474994"></a><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>Public Procurement Legislation</p><p>Public procurement and electronic procurement issues are controlled and managed by one Ministry in Hungary.

The monitoring of public procurement is carried out by the Prime Minister’s Office (in procurement procedures financed both by domestic budget and EU funds) and the Public Procurement Authority, subordinated to the Parliament (monitoring of contract and award notices, etc.).</p><p class="subtitle">System for eProcurement Infrastructure</p><p>The use of a single national eProcurement solution, the <a href="https://ekr.gov.hu/">EKR</a>, is mandated by the Public Procurement Act for all contracting authorities and contracting entities in public procurement procedures both below and above EU public procurement thresholds. The EKR is operated by <a href="https://nekszt.hu/">NEKSZT Ltd.</a>, a State-owned company under the control of the Prime Minister’s Office.</p><p>The EKR was developed in late 2017 and from 1 January to 14 April 2018 was used on a voluntary basis. However, eProcurement through the EKR has become compulsory for all contracting authorities since 15 April 2018 (though central purchasing bodies may partially use their own platforms). At that point, the paper-based administration of procurements ceased.</p><p class="subtitle">Online Invoice System </p><p>Since July 2018, <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/">eInvoicing</a> has become obligatory for transactions including an output VAT of more than HUF 100,000 (approximately EUR 320) between domestic taxpayer businesses. In July 2020, the amount of output VAT was reduced to HUF 0, with all invoices issued between domestic taxpayers being exchanged through the available system. In January 2021, the obligation of sending invoice data was extended to all kinds of invoices issued by domestic taxpayers, but taxpayers have an additional 3 months to prepare themselves for fulfilling the obligation without any sanction. For this purpose, the National Tax and Customs Administration (NTCA) developed and launched a central <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/home">Online Invoice System</a> connected to the financial management software or the ERP system of businesses via machine-to-machine interface. In case of paper invoices, data must be provided manually using the online service within five days, also encouraging businesses to turn to the use of eInvoicing. The NTCA also provides an online invoicing solution free of charge, mainly for SMEs, that can be used to issue eInvoices as well as paper invoices, and automatically sends the invoice data to the NTCA, regardless of the amount of the output VAT. To promote and encourage eInvoicing and digital administration, in May 2020 this free online invoicing programme was made available through a mobile app, also helping to reduce administrative steps. </p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing in Public Procurement</p><p>To comply with Directive 2014/55/EU on electronic invoicing in public procurement, since 18 April 2019 the Public Procurement Act has been requiring contracting authorities to receive and process invoices which comply with the relevant European standard. The Public Procurement Act does not clarify further the means to process invoices, leaving it to the contracting authorities to choose the method of transmission and processing.</p><p>A so-called eInvoicing module is also available in the EKR, enabling to verify whether an invoice complies with the European standard EN 16931-1:2017 and the syntax list published by the European Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union. The eInvoicing module can help contracting authorities to decide whether they have a legal obligation to receive and process a specific invoice or not.</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>Electronic Payment and Settlement System</p><p><a href="https://www.nisz.hu/hu/efer-â-elektronikus-fizetÃ©si-Ã©s-elszÃ¡molÃ¡si-rendszer">NISZ Zrt</a>., as the provider of the Electronic Payment and Settlement System (EFER), provides an electronic payment service for both electronic and traditional paper-based procedures. More specifically, the EFER allows for a single transaction to be used to pay fees related to a given case but payable on a different basis, as well as to clear the paid amount to the target accounts. The EFER is a central electronic payment service (with an associated settlement system) that allows customers to fulfil their payment obligations to electronic administration bodies using a bank card, a virtual bank card or an internet bank.</p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474997"></a>Cross-border platforms</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Personal Data and Address RegistryAs the most important base registry, the <a href="https://www.nyilvantarto.hu/hu/adatszolgaltatas_szemelyi">Personal Data and Address Registry</a>, maintained by the Ministry of the Interior, is a public official register that contains and certifies the personal and notification addresses specified by law for registered citizens, as well as any changes thereto.
