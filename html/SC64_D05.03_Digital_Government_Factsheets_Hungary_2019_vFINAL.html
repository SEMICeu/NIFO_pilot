Digital Post refers to the possibility that governments communicate electronically-only with citizens or entrepreneurs through e.g. personal mailboxes or other digital mail solutions.</p><p>These top-level benchmarks are measured using a life-events (e.g. mystery shopping) approach. Eight life events are included in the overall eGovernment performance score.

The <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/download/5/ff/70000/NIS_EN_clear.pdf">National Infocommunication Strategy 2014-2020</a> has given a comprehensive overview on the situation of the Hungarian information society and the ICT market, to define the ideal target situation, and to identify professional trends and development targets in infocommunication technology. The strategy covers components of the digital ecosystem in which any task, backlog, market error or bottleneck can be clearly identified and may be handled more effectively by the state with the help of public policy, regulatory and support policy instruments than through the organic development of the market. The Strategy defined the targets and identified the tools according to the following pillars:</p><p><strong>Digital Infrastructure</strong>: The government’s firm intention was that every household have internet access of at least 30 Mbps by 2018. The full range of the National Telecommunication Backbone Network was established in 2018. Further goals included the mobile broadband coverage reaching 95% by 2016, and a broadband internet access of at least 20Mbps made accessible for all educational institutions.</p><p><strong>Digital Competences</strong>: Development of the digital skills of citizens, enterprises (primarily SMEs) and public administration employees. The major objective is that the rate of the digitally illiterate people among the adult population be reduced to 30% by 2020, and that the indicator of regular internet usage should reach 65%. According to the target values set in the strategy, 99% of micro and small enterprises could have internet access by 2020.</p><p><strong>Digital Economy</strong>: The development of the ICT sector in the narrower sense, electronic (commercial, bank, etc.) services and corporate IT systems as well as the stimulation of R&amp;D and innovation activities. The intention is to double the number of persons attending ICT trainings, as well as increase the value of Hungarian software and services exports by 2020 compared to current indicators. If strategic goals are met, one third of SMEs may administer their transactions online by the end of this decade.</p><p>The National Council for Telecommunications and Information Technology, in cooperation with the Ministry of Interior and the Prime Minister’s Office, published the new eGovernment service development guidelines consisting of the following documents, encompassing different projects on developing new eGovernment services:</p><p>Services assessment guide;</p><p>Criteria and guidelines for designing the order of digitising administrative processes;</p><p>Guide for digitising;</p><p>Communication guidelines.</p><p>The tool for establishing a Digital State is providing the adequate infocommunication background, whereas developing eServices enables the improvement of citizens’ quality of life. As an effort towards these goals, the uniform governmental IT background has been set up and enables citizens and enterprises to manage the full range of their public administration affairs online since 2018.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Security aspects related to digital government</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>The new <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/download/2/f9/81000/StratÃ©gia honlapon kÃ¶zzÃ©tÃ©telre-20180103_4829494_2_20190103130721.pdf">Cybersecurity Strategy</a> was adopted at the end of December 2018 (1838/2018.

The legislative framework was established according to the NIS 2014-2020 with the adoption of the Act CCXXII. of 2015 on eAdministration and trust services (hereinafter eAdministration Act). Pursuant to the eAdministration Act, from 1 January 2018, the cooperating bodies involved in administrative processes shall obtain information (data or documents) from another cooperating body rather than asking the customer (citizen or business) to resubmit it. They must obtain that information by automated data exchange process where possible, or by a simple secure information exchange where it is not possible. According to the eAdministration Act, electronically cooperating organisations are obliged to prepare their information transfer rules, publish them and send them to the Electronic Administration Supervisory Authority (EÜF) within the Ministry of Interior. </p><p>Pursuant to the eAdministration Act, the EÜF shall manage and publish the register of the information sources (based on the content of the information transfer rules submitted). The purpose of the register of information sources is to take steps to identify redundant administrative burdens in public services, as well as to enable citizens and any other organisations to find out which public administration organisation keeps what kind of records, and under what procedure and how to claim data.  </p><p>The Ministry of Interior also set a policy criterion that is in line with most of <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2c2f2554-0faf-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1.0017.02/DOC_3&amp;format=PDF">the EIF recommendations</a>. In case of the development and design of public administration, ICT solutions and services priority comply with eGovernment policy criteria set by the Ministry of Interior concerning the development projects. This also means that alignment with the eGovernment development objectives of the European Union is ensured as much as possible, including the EIF. The Ministry of Interior in its supervisory role regarding governmental ICT and eGovernment projects, ensures that all development projects are made in accordance with the policy principles and objectives as much as possible.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Digital Success Programme</p><p>The <a href="http://www.kormany.hu/en/cabinet-office-of-the-prime-minister/hu/digital-success-programme">Digital Success Programme</a> initiated the establishment of the Hungarian Artificial Intelligence Coalition formed on 9 October 2018.

The Ministry for Innovation and Technology is working to significantly improve the available national HPC capacity. Preparatory work is ongoing to formulate a government decree on the procurement for (about) 15 PetaFlops capacity of a national HPC centre and the necessary building and technology facilities and human capacity for the operation of the HPC.

It aimed to further develop the networks, raise the capacity to at least 100 Mbps available anywhere in the country, and further develop optical networks with Gigabit capabilities to expand the Gigabit broadband network coverage.</p><p class="subtitle">National Telecommunications Backbone Network (NTG)</p><p>The <a href="https://nisz.hu/hu/projektek/nemzeti-tÃ¡vkÃ¶zlÃ©si-gerinchÃ¡lÃ³zat-ntg-fejlesztÃ©se">National Telecommunications Backbone Network (NTG)</a> is a secure<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>extensive country-wide broadband network forming the basic infrastructure of electronic government in Hungary. Launched in 2012 with the upgrade of the former Electronic Government Backbone (EKG - launched in 2004), this high-speed network connects the 19 county seats with Budapest providing the central administration, as well as regional institutions with a secured and monitored communication infrastructure, supporting data communication, Internet access, electronic mail, government intranet and other services.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Central Government Service Bus (KKSZB)</p><p>By April 2019, 85 public administration bodies were already connected to the KKSZB Central Government Service Bus interoperability platform. In total, 279 registries and services have been integrated to the platform including 27 registries enumerated by Government decree 451/2016. (XII. 19.) on the detailed rules of electronic administration (the implementing decree of the eAdministration Act). The <a href="http://www.idomsoft.hu/index.php/rolunk/termekek-es-szolgaltatasok/123-termekeink/308-kozponti-kormanyzati-szolgaltatas-busz-kkszb">Hungarian Central Governmental Service Bus (KKSZB)</a> is an interoperability platform that aims to ensure a service-oriented and standardised connection between the national base registries and the different specific public administration information systems. This is achieved through unification of the communication methods.</p><p>KKSzB makes it possible to connect systems with different technological, operational and integrational levels, as well as to reduce redundant data storage and data-integrity errors resulting from this practice. KKSzB ensures the electronic communication, interoperability and secure data exchange of authentic data among the public administrative authorities.</p><p>It is possible to join KKSzB as a service provider and as a client at the same time. This makes it technically possible for applications targeted at citizens and businesses to reach all services provided by the connected service providers via KKSzB, so long as they have permission to do so.</p><p>The pilot period began on 31 March 2017 with the publication of two already existing eGovernment services on KKSzB (the registry of private entrepreneurs and the registry of parking permits). The trial was deemed a success.</p><p>Another ten main base registries maintained by the Ministry of Interior were connected to the KKSzB in October 2017 and were available for testing until the end of December 2017, after which they were published as live services on the KKSzB.</p><p>The KKSzB online since 1 January 2018 makes possible the replacement of today’s spiderweb-like architecture in the realm of communication between base registries and specific sectoral systems, raising the possibility of establishing new connections in a much easier way. Connected registries have been available through the KKSzB technical interoperability platform since January 2018. Most of the Public Administration stakeholders are expected to connect to the KKSzB throughout 2018 according to their own ongoing development projects.</p><p class="subtitle">Municipality ASP</p><p>Following the successful <a href="https://alkalmazaskozpont.asp.lgov.hu/">Municipality ASP</a> pilot project in 2015-2016, with approximately 100 municipalities involved, the nationwide expansion of the central application service provider for municipalities, and further development of the available applications launched in 2016 (Municipality ASP 2.0 project), continued throughout 2017. The goal of the central ASP for municipalities was to provide modern, integrated and cost-effective state of the art IT solutions for local governments. It was based on the application service provider’s central hardware and software infrastructure, fostering standardised internal operation of the local governments and a common platform-based provision of local eGovernment services to citizens and businesses. </p><p>After completion of the first phase of expansion, more than 1 700 municipalities were connected to the system in January 2017, with another 1 300 municipalities gaining access within the next twelve months. In fact, since January 2018, 2 994 local municipalities have joined the integrated application portfolio (financial management software, municipal tax software, document management software, industrial and commercial management software, property cadastre, eAdministration web portal and the online form management). More than 93% of local municipalities and 20 000 users a day were using the same centrally managed software during their daily work, which represented great strides regarding the interoperability between local governments. </p><p>Based on the centrally provided integrated back-office software, through the <a href="https://ohp.asp.lgov.hu/">local eAdministration portal</a> it is possible to provide local eGovernment services on a single platform. For this purpose, the ASP Centre provides more than 50 online form templates for different kinds of services that can be locally customised and published on the Municipality ASP’s eAdministration portal. (If there is no online form, the portal links the user directly to the <a href="https://epapir.gov.hu/"><em>e-Papír</em></a> eDelivery service.) </p><p>Users log into the local eAdministration portal with their official Hungarian eID methods like the Client Gate account or national eID card. Online forms are automatically prefilled with personal data, addresses, personal tax ID number, health insurance number, personal e-mail address and telephone number from the respective base registries – a great advance in the application of the once-only principle as well as an improvement of data quality on the local government level. </p><p>During the third round of extension on 1 January 2019, the remaining 203 municipalities joined the Municipality ASP service as users (out of which 39 municipalities did not give up all their previous IT systems, and only use a part of the ASP’s services). Since then practically all 3 197 Hungarian local governments have been indicted into the centrally provided service. The number of users of the Municipality ASP system at the municipalities has now reached more than 31,000 persons.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Client Gate</p><p>Since April 2005, Hungary had a comprehensive central identification solution (<a href="https://ugyfelkapu.magyarorszag.hu/">Client Gate</a>) for the identification of citizens for electronic transactions carried out between public authorities and citizens. However, there has not yet been a comprehensive solution for the identification of citizens in electronic transactions carried out between public authorities. The Client Gate is capable of identifying citizens for any public authority that connects to it.</p><p class="subtitle">Central Authentication Agent</p><p>In January 2016 a new central identification solution, the <a href="https://kau.gov.hu/informacio/kau">Central Authentication Agent</a>, was launched, supporting the use of different electronic identification and authentication services. It included the already existing Client Gate, and the newly introduced national eID card, as well as the Partial Code Telephone Authentication. According to current plans, the eIDAS authentication will be also made available within the Central Authentication Agent.</p><p class="subtitle">eID</p><p>Since February 2018, eServices already integrated into the Central Authentication Agent service can be accessed via electronic identification with the use of the <a href="https://eszemelyi.hu/">Hungarian eID card</a>. The Hungarian eIDAS node is under development and the preparation of the notification of the Hungarian electronic identification means (eID card) is in progress. In January 2019, the number of eID cards issued since its launch in January 2016 reached 4 million. The number of Client Gate accounts reached 3.7 million in January 2019.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474994"></a>Public Procurement legislation</p><p>The control and management of public procurement and electronic procurement issues are divided in Hungary. The <a href="https://www.kozbeszerzes.hu/cikkek/kozbeszerzesi-torveny-es-kapcsolodo-jogszabalyok">public procurement law</a> is prepared by the Ministry for Innovation and Technology. The Directorate of Central Public Procurement and Services is responsible for centralised public procurements. The monitoring of public procurement is carried out by the Ministry for Innovation and Technology (in procurement procedures financed by domestic budget), the Prime Minister’s Office (in procurement procedures financed by the EU budget) and the Public Procurement Authority subordinate to Parliament (monitoring of contract and award notices, etc.). As electronic procurement is a part of the development of electronic government, the Prime Minister’s Office is also involved.</p><p class="subtitle">System for eProcurement infrastructure</p><p>There is currently no central eProcurement infrastructure in Hungary. However, the government decree <a href="http://net.jogtar.hu/jr/gen/hjegy_doc.cgi?docid=A0700257.KOR">257/2007. (V.25.)</a> on electronic procurement and electronic auctions established a new system for <a href="http://www.kozbeszerzes.hu/">eProcurement infrastructure</a>, which enabled service providers from the market to provide several eProcurement services for the procuring public bodies. The decree also establishes the rules of electronic auctions, enabling eAuctioning in several procurement processes. The Government is currently examining further possibilities of eProcurement development, including the long-term possibility of establishing a central public procurement system for centralised procurements. This will support electronic catalogues, electronic auctions and dynamic purchasing for central government bodies (e.g. ministries, etc.). The development of the new website of the Directorate of Central Public Procurement and Services is currently in progress. Hungary also takes part in the PEPPOL project and in several EU workgroups.</p><p>The <a href="https://ekr.gov.hu/">national central eProcurement System</a> was launched in January 2018 and its use became obligatory from 15 April 2018. At that point the paper-based administration of procurements ceased. </p><h2>eInvoicing</h2><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing legislation</p><p>Since July 2018, <a href="https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/">eInvoicing</a> became obligatory for transactions included output VAT of more than 100 000 HUF (approximately 320 EUR) issued between domestic taxpayer businesses. For this purpose, the National Tax and Customs Administration (NTCA) developed and launched a central Online Invoice system connected to financial management software or the ERP system of businesses via machine to machine interface. In case of paper invoices, the data provision must be done manually within the use of the online service within five days. This also encourages businesses to turn to use eInvoicing. The NTCA also provides an online invoicing solution free of charge mainly for SME-use that can be used to issue eInvoices as well as paper invoices, and automatically sends the data of the invoice to the NTCA regardless the amount of the included output VAT. This also helps to reduce administrative steps. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p><a id="_Toc1474997"></a>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><h2>Cross-border platforms</h2><p><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">The TAKARNET network</p><p>The Hungarian Land office of the unified real estate registration system in Hungary, the <a href="http://www.foldhivatal.hu/content/view/172/163/">TAKARNET network</a>, is an intranet-like network of the land offices. It connects all official entities involved in the land administration sector and provides online access to the continuously updated land registration data. Furthermore, the network provides online access for external users (registered and authorised) and has been up and running since April 2003. Depending on their registered rights, users have access to data ranging from all registered data regarding Hungary’s lands and properties to a more limited subset of information. </p><p>The improvement of the online case management through TAKARNET allowed the Hungarian land registration data supply/service to reach the third level on eGovernmental service in the qualification scale defined by the EU (a service which provides interaction from both sides).</p><p>The services provided by the TAKARNET network include the request of documents, the retrieval of non-certified copies of the title deed, eCertified copies of the title deed, map copies, change of personal information and guidance for installing the eSignature programme.</p><p>Registering to the portal has to be done in person at any government office since it requires a personal customer portal ID. In case of ownership of a valid identity card electronically, the process is quicker.</p><p class="subtitle">The Association Register</p><p>The Association Registry helps to connect associated public administration registries and professional systems via an interoperable programmed service interface, creating interoperability between full sets of data and facilitating the exchange of data based on the encrypted contact code. To protect personal data, the Association Registry does not include any personal information or other sectoral ID, the encrypted contact codes are used instead. This is due to strict Hungarian privacy rules prohibiting the use of a single identification number for individuals. Currently, the number of items contained in the Association Registry is 13.5 million, from which 8.2 million are generated as encrypted contact code based on the ID cards (ID item) and 2.8 million are generated as encrypted contact code based on passports (Passport items).</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Register of Registers (NyENy)</p><p>The Electronic Administration Supervisory Authority (EÜF) in accordance with the law on the general rules of electronic administration and trust services (the eAdministration Act) and Implementing Regulations shall manage and publish the register of the information sources (based on the content of the information transfer rules submitted) and the List of Data and Document Titles. The purpose of the register of information sources is to take steps to identify redundant administrative burdens in public services, as well as to enable citizens and other organisations of which public administration organisations keep what kind of records, under what procedure, and how to claim data.</p><p>NyENy is a registration system where primarily the information transfer rules can be prepared and recorded, and also the register of the information sources and the List of Data and Document Titles can be managed. </p><p>NyENy helps to develop the interpretation of standard definitions, to simplify the process of administration, to extend the recent information system techniques and technological solutions, and the orientation of the clients (citizens or representatives of public services).</p><h1><a id="_Toc12971072"></a>Digital Government Services for Citizens </h1><p><a id="_Toc1475000"></a>The information in this section presents an overview of the basic public services provided to the citizens.
