The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below. </p><p><img src="img/35-171.png" alt="35-171.png" /> </p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021 </a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Slovenia in 2021.</p><p><img src="img/35-203.png" alt="35-203.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Slovenia’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF principles. Slovenia meets the European average for every principle, except for Principle 3 (Transparency) which obtains a score of 3, for Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility) and for Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency), which are below the European average with a score of 2. These therefore represent areas of improvement for Slovenian public administrations to first, enhance internal visibility and to provide external interfaces for European public services by enhancing the online availability and accessibility of the administrative procedures (Recommendation 05). Second, ensure that all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Recommendation 14) and lastly, ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits (Recommendation 19).</p><p><img src="img/35-214.png" alt="35-214.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Slovenian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance. Slovenia reaches a maximum score of 4, in line with the European average, for all interoperability layers. To maintain this high performance, a potential area of improvement could be to enhance the implementation of two recommendations linked to interoperability governance, Recommendation 22, on considering relevant EU recommendations and to seek to make the approach consistent across borders, and Recommendation 23, which addresses the consultation of relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level, in accordance with their National Interoperability Frameworks (NIFs), when procuring and developing ICT solutions.</p><p><img src="img/35-232.png" alt="35-232.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Slovenia’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of most recommendations. In line with the European average, Slovenia gets a maximal score of 4 for open data and internal information sources and services. Higher than the European average, Slovenia obtains a maximal score of 4 for external information sources and services, for security and privacy and for catalogues. Lower than the European average, Slovenia scored 3 for both the conceptual model itself and base registries. In order to reach a higher performance in these categories, potential areas of improvement could be to enhance the implementation of Recommendation 35, on the use of common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components, putting in place and maintaining the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining public services and of Recommendation 40, on the creation and use of data quality assurance plans for base registries and related master data.</p><p>Additional information on Slovenia’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Slovenia 2020 - Development Strategy for the Information Society</p><p>At the beginning of 2016, the government of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the long-term <a href="https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/DID/Digital-Slovenia-2020-Development-Strategy-for-the-Information-Society-until-2020.pdf">Digital Slovenia 2020 - Development Strategy for the Information Society</a>. The detailed objectives of this strategy included:</p><ul><li>Raising general awareness on the importance of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the internet for the development of society;</li><li>Sustainable, systematic and targeted investment in the development of a digital society;</li><li>General digitalisation according to the ‘Digital by Default’ principle;</li><li>Competitive digital entrepreneurship and digital industry for digital growth;</li><li>Intensive and innovative use of ICT and the internet in all segments of society;</li><li>High-speed access, open internet for all;</li><li>Inclusive digital society;</li><li>Secure cyberspace;</li><li>Trust and confidence in the cyberspace and the protection of human rights; and</li><li>Slovenia – a point of reference for the deployment of innovative approaches in the use of digital technologies.</li></ul><p>The strategy’s vision called on Slovenia to take advantage of the development opportunities of ICT and the internet, thus becoming an advanced digital society and reference environment for the deployment of innovative approaches in the use of digital technologies at a systemic level. At the same time, a high level of protection of personal data and communication privacy in a digital society should be ensured, so as to create trust and confidence in digitalisation and the cyberspace.</p><p>The government favours investments in the digitalisation of entrepreneurship, an innovative data-driven economy, the development and use of the internet, as well as smart communities, cities and homes. Within these limits, it favours research on and technology development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data and mobile technologies. Because the government wishes to enable equal integration into the European Digital Single Market for Slovenian stakeholders, it uses ICT and the internet innovatively in all development areas. In the future, it will invest in education to promote digital society.</p><p>Currently, this is still the only valid strategy for this field. However, the new strategy for the information society is being prepared. </p><p>The Digital Slovenia 2030 strategy will be the umbrella strategy in the field of digital transformation and will determine the key strategic development directions for the future of the country. It will integrate individual sectoral strategies into a single strategic development framework.   </p><p>The strategy will highlight the essential orientations for key areas of digital transformation (existing and upcoming sectoral strategies), connect them in a meaningful way and cover those areas which are important for the digital transformation of the country and that the sectoral strategies do not (yet) describe. </p><p>The guiding principle of the forthcoming strategy Digital Slovenia 2030 is that Slovenia wants to make best and most responsible use of all social and economic opportunities for digital transformation. Slovenia's vision is to improve the quality of life of its citizens in a sustainable, green, and trustworthy way through the digital transformation of all segments of society. </p><p>The structure of the strategy followed the one of the Digital Compass and the following four key pillars underpinning the digital shift were identified: (i) competences and a digital inclusion ecosystem, (ii) secure and sustainable digital infrastructures, (iii) the digital transformation of businesses, and (iv) the digitization of key public services.</p><p class="subtitle">Public Administration 2020 – Slovenian Public Administration Development Strategy 2015–2020</p><p>The main purpose of the <a href="http://www.mju.gov.si/nc/en/media_room/news/article/1328/6505/">Slovenian Public Administration Development Strategy</a> is to create a platform for a real improvement in the operations of Slovenia’s public administration, which is about to be modernised and renewed. Reform will be achieved by introducing a comprehensive management system through centralised strategic planning, while ensuring quality control systems for the simplification and modernisation of administrative processes, as well as monitoring and evaluating the work done and the targets to be achieved across all levels. Effective public administration cannot be achieved without efficient government IT. Improving the state of ICT in public administration will have significant synergistic effects in achieving other strategic targets, as well as in the development of the information society as a whole. </p><p>Data governance is a prerequisite for data driven developments, operations, decisions, and innovative approaches. In this context, a set of actions was put in place. The development of a central metadata dictionary is a priority and is also the prerequisite for a data repository, which will provide views with different perspectives and contexts, and will be the basis for knowing and understanding the data. The repository will provide information on how applications are connected to the data, what institutions are responsible for the data, and how data are used through public administration procedures.<a id="_Hlk8376358"></a></p><p>In the context of the Slovenian Public Administration Development Strategy 2015–2020, which also covered the Digital Government Strategy, the government adopted an action plan every two years. Currently, this is still the only valid strategy for this field. However, a Digital Public Services Strategy 2030 is under preparation. It will encompass several components to achieve the 2030 Digital Compass goals in the field of e-services. The first three components of the expected outcomes of the digital government vision are:</p><ul><li>A service-oriented government with a user-centred approach that puts people, their user experience, and their needs as the primary focus. A central message of the component is understanding the users’ needs and building the services, programmes, and policies around them rather than concentrating on organisations or information silos;</li><li>An open, collaborative, and accessible government that is accountable to Slovenians, shares information with them, engages them in policy development and service co-design, and is inspired by the principles of inclusion and accessibility; and</li><li>The principle ‘digital-first’, with a digitally-enabled government that is available anytime, anywhere, through any service window. This does not mean ‘digital only’, but it does entail that digital service delivery cannot be an afterthought and, most importantly, that in-person and telephone interactions must be digitally enabled to provide excellence in service delivery.</li></ul><p>The latter three strategic components are foundational enablers of the ultimate outcomes outlined below:</p><ul><li>A trusted digital identification system, including the introduction of a new e-Identity Card and the development of a mobile eID; </li><li>Modern technology and modern information practices, including better integration between information management/information technology, policy, programme, and service delivery, embracing an innovative and responsible use of new technologies, managing security and privacy, and being driven by data;</li><li>A digitally enabled public service with the skills, tools, values, and mindset that the public servants need to enable a digital government, deliver digital services, and work openly and collaboratively. Both professional development and smart recruitment will play a role in this strategic approach, with the latter presenting an opportunity to promote diversity and inclusion; and</li><li>Good digital governance that ensures proper project oversight and strategic prioritization, and allows to learn from past mistakes and build on past successes. Governance is not only about managing risk, but also about enabling innovation and experimentation. </li></ul><p class="subtitle"><a href="https://www.stopbirokraciji.gov.si/fileadmin/user_upload/mju/templates/pdf/AN_VG_17-6-2019-b3_P.pdf">Action Plan for Better Regulation</a></p><p>In July 2019, the <a href="https://www.stopbirokraciji.gov.si/fileadmin/user_upload/mju/templates/pdf/AN_VG_17-6-2019-b3_P.pdf">Action Plan for Better Regulation</a> was adopted by the government of the Republic of Slovenia with the aim to develop a systemic approach for better regulation. The key result of the action plan will be the setting-up of the MOPED system (a modular IT system for eDocuments). The application operates within the government network and is not accessible to the general public.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">Semantic Interoperability Implementation Strategy</p><p>In 2018, the <a href="http://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/strategija+upravljanja+semanticne+interoperabilnosti?lang=en">Semantic Interoperability Implementation Strategy</a> was adopted. With the help of the tools and procedures defined in the strategy, the following areas will be addressed:</p><ul><li>The Once-Only principle;</li><li>A more efficient and standardised planning of information solutions data models; and</li><li>A greater degree of interoperability between information systems in the public administration.</li></ul><p>Centralisation of government IT, which was completed in 2018, is well on the way and represents the implementation of established daily procedures among public administration organs. However, experience with the pandemic has shown the need for further digitalisation in all areas, including public administration, as digital public administration is a prerequisite for an agile response to change and efficient provision of services to both citizens and businesses.</p><p>Slovenia chose to focus the allocation of its resources on:</p><ul><li>The centralisation of government IT (e.g. government private cloud); </li><li>The development of digital solutions with different horizontal building blocks for common functionalities, e.g. for data exchange (Tray), trust services for authentication, eSignature and other trust services, like a central e-delivery and eMandate system; </li><li>A digital services development platform (so called JEP) – establishing a national framework for the successful implementation of eServices; and</li><li>The introduction of a national eID card by the end of 2021 and a mobile‑based solution for eIdentification and eSignature, aiming to improve the take-up of eServices.</li></ul><p>For the future development, the Slovenian government confirms its political commitment towards ensuring high quality, user-centric and seamless cross-border digital public services for citizens and businesses, ensuring that they are inclusive and accessible also for persons with disabilities. The cooperation will continue between government, citizens, businesses, academia and civil society, gradually increasing the level of co-design with end users. The government will encourage the use of AI and other novel technologies to improve the well‑being of the citizens, always paying attention to their fundamental rights. As other members of the European Union, Slovenia is now preparing a Resilience and Recovery Plan, focusing on the component of the digital transformation of the public sector and public administration, which will provide an appropriate response to the critical shortcomings in the public sector digitisation that emerged (even more clearly) during the COVID-19 epidemic, such as: insufficient range, availability or quality of eServices, insufficient and outdated IT equipment, insufficient network connection capacity and IT infrastructure, which turned out to be particularly problematic in the light of the increased volume of digital business.</p><p>The component envisages six reforms: </p><ul><li>Strengthening the public administration digital transformation management; </li><li>Establishing an environment for the use of public administration eServices; </li><li>Establishing a competence centre and raising the skills of public administration employees; </li><li>Modernising administrative processes for a successful digital transformation;</li><li>Ensuring cybersecurity; </li><li>Transitioning to a gigabit society and investing in nine areas that go beyond public administration and interact with the field of public sector operation (strengthening the digital skills of civil servants, the gigabit infrastructure, digitalisation in the public administration environment, internal security, education, science and sport, environment and space, agriculture, food and forestry, culture and justice).</li></ul><p class="subtitle">National Interoperability Framework </p><p>The <a href="http://nio.gov.si/nio/vstopna.nio?lang=en">National Interoperability Framework (NIO) Portal</a> is a cornerstone of interoperability and a basic tool for publishing, monitoring, and using interoperability products.

The programme is designed around the concept of ‘innovation diffusion lifecycle’ meaning that its main vision is to diffuse more than 40 years of research, knowledge and experiences in AI to real trustworthy and ethical AI solutions used in business and in the public sector. In order to achieve this, NpAI sets ten strategic goals that include: support to research and innovation projects, establishment of proper data and computational infrastructure and, finally, support for reference implementation projects in six priority areas (health, industry 4.0, public administration, language technologies, sustainable food production and environment, and spatial planning)</p><p>The National programme for AI represents the main strategic policy instrument to support activities - from research and innovation to AI uptake - in the period 2021–2025. </p><p>NpAI foresees a special governance structure led by the <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/government-offices/government-office-for-digital-transformation/">Government Office for Digital Transformation</a> that will both provide guidance and make decisions with respect to the implementation of all the measures in the NpAI in a multi-sectorial and inter-ministerial setup. External representatives of stakeholders and experts have also been included in order to steer implementation and changes in the future years towards technology, market and policy-based directions. The NpAI will provide the policy framework and concrete support to research and deployment activities but, with respect to the latter, only for reference implementation projects in six priority areas, which are listed above.

The Central Register of the Population Act is a distribution database in which population data are centrally collected, processed, stored and used in order to monitor the situation and trends in the population for the needs of State authorities and other users. Such monitoring is necessary for the performance of prescribed tasks, for the management of databases on individuals and for the purpose of carrying out statistical, socio-economic and other surveys, as prescribed by law.</p><p class="subtitle">Real Estate Cadastre </p><p>The <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7952">Real Estate Cadastre Act</a> was published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 54/21, on 9 April 2021 and shall apply from 4 April 2022. The act defines <a href="https://eprostor.gov.si/imps/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/5aa2b97b-2ea3-427f-a9fb-d7827c61c115">Real Estate Cadastre</a> as an official record of data on the position, shapes, physical and other characteristics of the parcels, buildings and parts thereof, which will show the actual condition of the real estate. Current maintenance of the three real estate records (Land Cadastre, Building Cadastre and Real Estate Register), kept by the same body, has shown the need to establish a modern information system for recording real estate data in one record - the Real Estate Cadastre. The entry of all data on real estate in the same record, with the appropriate control system, eliminates the risk of discrepancies and allows greater consistency of the data. All the entered data will be kept permanently. In the Real Estate Cadastre, there are also data on cadastral municipalities, actual use of the land, areas of credit ratings of the land and the layer of temporary entries (building rights and data on the area of real easement or land registry decision). </p><p class="subtitle">Vehicle Registry</p><p>As concerns the Vehicle Registry, the <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO5791">Motor Vehicles Act </a>sets out the conditions for the placement of motor vehicles and trailers on the market, their registration and operation on the road network, and in the performance of agricultural or forestry work, the conditions for carrying out such tasks as the technical services, the registration of organisations managing databases on vehicles, and the monitoring of the implementation of this law. The <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=PRAV10486">Rules on the Registration of Motor Vehicles</a> and trailers set out the registration conditions to be met, the procedures for the registration of motor vehicles and trailers, the issuance and revalidation of transport permits, the deregistration of vehicles, the change of vehicle owner or user data, the issuance of permits for test drives, record-keeping obligations and the storage of documents and evidence. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474968"></a><a id="_Hlk73445663"></a>eProcurement<a id="_Toc1474969"></a></h3><p class="subtitle">Public Procurement Act</p><p>On 1 April 2016, a <a href="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Predpisi/ZJN-3_ang_prevod.pdf">Public Procurement Act</a> entered into force, which transposed Directive 2014/24/EU and Directive 2014/25/EU. On 1 November 2018, an <a href="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Sistem_javnega_narocanja/ZJN-3A_anj_nov2018.pdf">amendment to the Public Procurement A</a>ct came in force. Its main objective was to further emphasise the importance of social aspects in public procurement procedures and public contract execution. The second amendment to the Public Procurement Act is in use since 1 January 2022, whose main objective is simplification of the procedure and additional transparency.</p><p>The Public Procurement Act lays down mandatory actions required of contracting authorities and tenderers in awarding public supply contracts, public service contracts and public works contracts. Among other provisions, the act sets out rules on mandatory publication of procurement notices in the <a href="https://www.enarocanje.si/">Public Procurement Portal</a>, on mandatory electronic submission and electronic communication in procurement procedures, on electronic verification of tenderers via official documents the information system eDossier, on the dynamic purchasing system and electronic auctions, thus also laying the groundwork for a public, State-developed eProcurement system called e-JN <a href="https://ejn.gov.si/en/">Information System. <a id="_Hlk67991725"></a>After the technological renovation at the end of 2018, the system combines functionalities that were originally developed as part of different stand-alone modules/applications </a>(eSubmissions, eAuctions, eDossier, eCatalogue and eInternal procedures for public authorities). </p><p>Furthermore, the 2017 amendment to the <a href="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Sistem_javnega_narocanja/ZPVPJN/ZPVPJN_ang_julij_18.pdf">Legal Protection in Public Procurement Procedures Act</a> introduced an electronic information system for legal protection procedures in public procurement, i.e. the <a href="https://www.portalerevizija.si/">eRevision Portal</a>. The eRevision Portal was established in September 2019 and enables the exchange of information and documents between contracting authorities, selected tenderers, the National Review Commission and other participants in the appeal proceedings. The eRevision Portal enables a widespread flow of information about the course of the review procedure. It communicates with the Public Procurement Portal to allow a smooth flow of information and documentation. This will significantly reduce the duration of the procedure and the administrative burdens and costs for the parties involved. The use of this portal is mandatory from 1 January 2021. </p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing Legislation</p><p>In Slovenia, the competent authority with purview on eInvoicing is the <a href="https://www.ujp.gov.si/dokumenti/dokument.asp?id=295">Public Payments Administration of the Republic of Slovenia</a>, attached to the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>Since 1 January 2015, public sector institutions have begun receiving electronic invoices for any goods and services.

Ever since, considerable progress has been made in terms of development, availability and use of eHealth. The Healthcare Databases Act was amended in 2018 to support cancer screening programmes and clinical registries. In 2020, the act was further amended in order to respond to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related data-processing requirements. The amendment provided legal ground for comprehensive digitalisation of communicable disease surveillance. Moreover, it facilitated the processing of health records for all persons receiving medical treatment in Slovenia, irrespective of their nationality, by enabling the cross-border exchange of healthcare records within the Central Registry of Patient Data (CRPD). Further amendments in 2021 introduced extensions of lawful data processing (e.g. legal base for Health Insurance Institute to access Central Registry of Patient Data). </p><p class="subtitle">Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act </p><p>The <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4284">Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act</a> and the accompanying Regulation on Documents and Archives Protection were both passed in 2006 to regulate the management of electronic content. The act states that all electronic records, including digitalised documents, have full legal status provided they comply with certain technical conditions. The accompanying regulation governs the activities and internal rules for individuals to keep documents and/or archives, the storage of such materials in physical and digital forms, the general conditions, the registration and accreditation of digital storage equipment and services, the selection and transfer of archives to public archival institutions, the processing and keeping of registries of archives, the protection of film and private archives, the use of archives in archival institutions and the work of the Archives Commission. The law also contains provisions regarding the long-term validity of eSignatures. Later amendments to the act took place in 2014. </p><p>This law eliminated the obligation of certifying internal rules for companies and public authorities at the Archives Commission and simplified the procedures for accreditation. It granted companies and other private organisations the power to decide, autonomously and without any State interference, the best method to store digital documents, leaving them the choice of the solutions and technologies to adopt.</p><p class="subtitle">Amendments to the Tax Procedure Act</p><p>With the 2021 amendments to the <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4703">Tax Procedure Act</a> (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia), legal ground was provided for online public auctions.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474971"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Big data</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud computing</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance computing</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle">Electronic Communications Act</p><p>The field of electronic communications in the Republic of Slovenia is regulated by the <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO6405">Electronic Communications Act</a> (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia No. 109/12, 110/13, 40/14-ZIN-B, 54/14-odl.

The Slovenian Digital Coalition is focused on attaining a cross-sector multiplier impact, accelerating the development of the digital society and leveraging opportunities for the development of ICT and the internet. In November 2020, the Slovenian Digital Coalition organised a forum showcasing three years of work and assessing the current state of play in the field of digital transformation. </p><p>A wide variety of stakeholders took part in this forum and the topics discussed covered key areas in this field.</p><p>There are three focus areas for the Digital Coalition: </p><ul><li>Digital economy; </li><li>Digital competencies and education system; and</li><li>Regulatory and business ecosystem. </li></ul><p>Each area is supported by a coalition strategic working group.

The coalition is also actively participating in different events, represents the point of view of businesses and points to areas, where additional activities would be necessary for further growth.</p><p class="subtitle">Information Commissioner </p><p>The Information Commissioner performs the duties of the national data protection authority - it oversees the application of the rules on personal data protection, including the GDPR, the Personal Data Protection Act and the Act on the Protection of Personal Data in the Area of Treatment of Criminal Offences. It performs inspections and issues penalties with regards to violations of the named acts. The Information Commissioner also acts as a body of appeal for resolving complaints from the data subjects regarding their rights, namely the right of access by the data subject, the right to rectification, the right to erasure, etc. </p><p>On the other hand, the Information Commissioner oversees the application of the Access to Public Information Act with regards to individual complaints when liable public sector bodies refuse access to public documents or refuse a request for reuse of public sector information. The role that the Information Commissioner has played is vital in ensuring a high degree of institutional transparency. The number of individual complaints is steadily growing every year, which shows that the awareness on the Right to Access to Public Information has risen also among Slovenian citizens. The Information Commissioner receives only a low number of complaints every year regarding the right to reuse public information when compared to the number of complaints raised over the refusal of access to public documents. This can be interpreted as evidence that government efforts to promote and enable the reuse of public sector information are working.<a id="_Toc1474981"></a></p><h2><a id="_Hlk69200004"></a>Subnational (federal, regional and local)</h2><p class="subtitle">Municipalities</p><p>In accordance with the constitutional provisions, Slovenian municipalities and urban municipalities are autonomous in the field of introducing eSolutions. Local eGovernment initiatives are solely under the responsibility of local authorities, mostly municipalities, which implement them using their own mechanisms and time schedules. </p><p>Voluntary coordination is taking place in the framework of local government associations. For instance, the <a href="https://www.zmos.si/english/">Association of Urban Municipalities of Slovenia</a> established the Committee for Digitalisation and Smart Cities, which unites experts of the eleven urban municipalities. Cities exchange information on best practices, solutions and challenges and prepare position papers on State policies and public tenders. As the resources for implementing digital solutions at local level are limited, cities explore possibilities for cooperation in projects and initiatives that could be co‑financed by EU or State funds. </p><p>The <a href="https://skupnostobcin.si/english/">Association of Municipalities and Towns of Slovenia (SOS)</a> is another example of coordination of local self-government bodies. Besides working with bodies dealing with digital transition, the SOS coordinates access rights and offers support to the local authorities on the eTourism system. The SOS established a strategic partnership with University of Ljubljana, which resulted in the creation of the <a href="https://4pdih.com/en/intro-page/">4PDIH</a>. The aim of the 4PDIH is to foster awareness and provide services to grow digital competencies, share digital experience and case studies locally, regionally and internationally, and support the government to adapt regulation and open its data to foster entrepreneurship.</p><p class="subtitle">Smart Mlaka - a Smart Pilot Project</p><p>A prominent digitalisation and smart city project is being implemented in the city of Kranj. The <a href="https://www.interreg-central.eu/Content.Node/CITYCIRCLE/Smart-Mlaka-pilot-project.html">Smart Mlaka</a> Project is a pilot action of smart and digital solutions being applied at a neighbourhood level. The final solution of the mentioned project will enable the collection, display and analysis of data from smart meters (electricity, gas, water), smart sensors for the environment and traffic. This will give the municipality an insight into the organisation, the management and the challenges of such projects, and will constitute a model suitable for implementation in the rest of the municipality and beyond.</p><p><img src="img/35-723.jpeg" alt="A high angle view of a road

The number of sent eForms has substantially increased in comparison to previous years (+100%).</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk74231769"></a>MFERAC Personal Portal </p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.si/zbirke/storitve/mferac/">MFERAC Personal Portal</a> is a website intended for employees in the State administration (ministries, government departments, administrative units; judicial bodies; public economic institutions; local community and other State bodies) to receive ePayroll and other information related to the employment relationship, using the application for personnel management and calculation of labour costs of public finance institutions of the Republic of Slovenia. The MFERAC was developed by the <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/ministries/ministry-of-finance/">Ministry of Finance</a> as support for the implementation of the national budget by means of a single accounting system.</p><p class="subtitle">SPOT Portal for Businesses</p><p>The <a href="https://spot.gov.si/">One-Stop Shop Business Portal SPOT</a> (formerly named eVEM) is the government portal for companies, sole traders, entrepreneurs and future entrepreneurs, whose main purpose is to enable users to carry out public administration operations easily, quickly and free of charge. Through the SPOT Portal, businesses can use electronic services to establish a company and carry out other obligatory or frequent procedures, either at start-up or later (submission of forms for social insurance registration, declaration of changes to information on family members, notification of needs for workers, declaration of tax information, etc.). Users can carry out certain procedures independently online, using a valid digital certificate, while for some other more complicated procedures they would need to visit one of the 139 One Stop Shop contact points, the SPOT point or a public notary. </p><p>The main advantages of the SPOT portal are that it enables a free-of-charge sole trader registration usually within one day (in the past it took seven days) and the registration of a company with limited liabilities within three days (in the past it took more than 60 days). It also enables several eServices. </p><p>The majority of services carried out via the SPOT portal or the SPOT points are free of charge. New services are constantly developed for SPOT. In terms of development of new services, relevant stakeholders are being involved and the principles of interoperability are followed. The development is carried out with the cooperation of different governmental bodies. It includes the connection of different IT systems into the eService of SPOT, aiming at reusing already available data from different registries or systems and following the Once-Only principle, where possible.</p><p>In 2020, an important new functionality - the electronic sick leave - was introduced on the portal, which significantly reduced the administrative burden. The estimated cost savings for all participating stakeholders are EUR 11.5 million yearly. </p><p>In 2020–2021, new electronic services for municipalities were published on the portal, both on the Portal for Citizens eUprava and on the Business Portal SPOT.</p><p>In addition, the portal was visually redesigned in January 2021 to harmonise the user experience and, at the same time, improve the stability of the portal.</p><p class="subtitle">GOV.SI Portal</p><p>In 2016, the Slovenian government approved a new editorial project to avoid duplication of content on national websites and the main government portal. The number of administrative websites was cut from 350 to around 30. The new <a href="http://www.gov.si/">GOV.SI Portal</a> was launched in 2019 as central website for easy access to comprehensive information on the organisation and functioning of the State administration. Currently, GOV.SI is hosting web pages of 122 government bodies. </p><p>With this central platform, it was possible to quickly establish an efficient and central <a href="https://www.gov.si/teme/koronavirus-sars-cov-2/">digital communication channel</a> for COVID-19-related information, instructions, data etc. </p><p class="subtitle">NIO - National Interoperability Framework Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://nio.gov.si/nio/vstopna.nio?lang=en">National Interoperability Framework Portal (NIO)</a> enables the Slovenian public administration to publish information on the achievements of its digital solutions at national level and beyond. The NIO Portal is part of the Slovenian National Interoperability Framework, consisting of different guidelines, standards, information and building blocks. It helps to improve the coordination of business processes and enables better compatibility and connectivity on the national and international levels. Many useful assets are published and explained on the NIO portal. Institutions can use them when designing their business processes and related information systems. Examples of this include building blocks for electronic data enquiries, trade, the Tray Module, the Asynchronous Module and the Security Platform. If an institution wants to electronically gather data from data sources, it can use these building blocks and their functionalities. The owner of the information is always the institution which created them, regardless of whether the institution is part of the private sector or is a non‑governmental organisation. The use of NIO assets and solutions reduces development and operating costs, and achieves improved coherence of information solutions, as well as compliance with the European Interoperability Framework and coordination with solutions at the international level (e.g. the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/slovenian-interoperability-portal-nio">Joinup Platform</a>). </p><p class="subtitle">Stop the Bureaucracy Website</p><p>The<a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/ministries/ministry-of-public-administration/about-the-ministry/administrative-burden-reduction-and-better-regulation-service/"> Division for the Administrative Burden Reduction, Better Regulation and Quality in Public Administration</a> at the Ministry of Public Administration actively implements the principles of better regulation to ensure that decision making is open and transparent and that governmental actions are based on evidence. Its purpose is to understand the impacts of decisions, to achieve greater competitiveness of Slovenian businesses and to increase the satisfaction of citizens who engage with the public administration. The <a href="https://www.stopbirokraciji.gov.si/en/home" target="_blank">Stop the Bureaucracy Portal</a> plays a key role since it represents a link between the administration that prepares regulations and controls their implementation and the public, who can find all information about the administrative measures for reducing administrative and legislative burdens in one place. The video explaining in detail the process of submitting proposals to the portal can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE4DkYB1BBU&amp;feature=emb_title">here</a>. </p><p>The portal also provides information on programme implementation, publishes best practices (at both national and EU levels) and reports on administrative burdens and individual regulations (act, rule, etc.).</p><p>Users (and stakeholders) can submit proposals for reducing the regulatory burden and simplifying procedures. After being published on the website, proposals are assigned to the competent ministries, which may then express their opinions on the proposals and give their feedback to the user issuing the proposal. </p><p>It is also tasked with overseeing the implementation of the adopted initiatives, which are then translated into actions with clearly defined objectives, deadlines and responsible institutions, and aggregated in the <a href="https://enotnazbirkaukrepov.gov.si/">Single Document aimed at improving the legislative and business environment</a>. The stakeholders can regularly monitor the state of measure implementation online. In order to monitor the elimination of regulatory burdens, ex-post evaluations of the impacts of measures included in the Single Document are carried out. All ex-post evaluations are available on the Stop the Bureaucracy Portal.</p><p class="subtitle">Geoportal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.geoportal.gov.si/eng/">Slovenian Geoportal</a> was launched in 2008 and serves as the central access point for spatial data and the harmonised European spatial data infrastructure, INSPIRE. Many different stakeholders contribute to data, metadata and services. Here users can find a list of INSPIRE and other national spatial data sets and services, INSPIRE metadata, legislation related to INSPIRE requirements for establishing and operating interoperable National SDI, guidelines for technical interoperability, and the spatial data viewer. A new Slovenian metadata profile was upgraded in the form of an extended INSPIRE metadata profile. Metadata are connected (automatic harvesting) to the national Open Data Portal. In the year 2021 new stakeholders were included in the system and local communities were involved. The portal was renewed in the year 2021, to allow easier access to all data and improve the searching functions. The portal allows access to spatial data via spatial data services and metadata. Slovenian metadata are also connected to the <a href="https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/">European INSPIRE Geoportal</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">GeoHub-SI Portal</p><p><a href="https://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/geohubsi?lang=en">GeoHub-SI</a> is a GIS portal that provides a platform for publishing space-related content. The data published are in the form of GIS web services and applications, intended for both the internal and the general public. Users can view, query and analyse spatial data using published applications. Data presented in the form of web services can also be included in external applications. The portal is intended for access to data, services and applications shared by State institutions.</p><p>The infrastructural foundation of the portal is the National Computer Cloud (DRO), provided by the Ministry of Public Administration. The Ministry is also responsible for the uniform development of common information solutions in the State administration, so all those State institutions that have the right to use services on the DRO can publish on the portal.</p><p class="subtitle">National Open Data Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://podatki.gov.si/">National Open Data Portal (OPSI)</a> was launched in December 2016. The OPSI Portal represents a single national website for publishing open data for the entire public sector and has a dual function. Firstly, it represents the central catalogue of records and databases in the country; it is a central inventory of metadata from all records and databases managed by State authorities, municipalities and other public sector bodies. Secondly, it represents a single website for publishing data in open and machine‑readable formats. The portal provides everyone with the right to a free and easy reuse of freely accessible data published in the open data form for any purpose (i.e. for profit or not for profit). On the portal, all public sector bodies publish data by category. Currently, over 5 000 data sets have been published on the portal (at least with metadata). </p><p>The goal was to establish the so-called Open Data Ecosystem based on the OPSI Portal, to encourage cooperation between all stakeholders concerned by the opening and/or reuse of data. In March 2020, the Slovenian government achieved its goal by establishing the OPSIHub. The following year, the OPSIHub had 15 members which represent public sector institutions, educational institutions, non-governmental organisations, research journalists, start-up companies, small and medium-sized enterprises and larger companies.</p><p>Slovenia was ranked among the top countries in the field of open data (OECD OURIndex 2019). Slovenia also ensures a high level of protection to the right of access to public information with the aim of increasing the participation of citizens and raising the accountability of public authorities to ensure good governance and tackle corruption. In 2021, Slovenia started renovating the OPSI Portal to update it based on the latest guidelines and good practices followed by the best open data portals around the world.</p><p class="subtitle">e-JN</p><p><a href="https://ejn.gov.si/en/">After the technological renovation at the end of 2018, the system combines functionalities that were originally developed as part of different stand-alone modules/applications </a>(eSubmissions, eAuctions, eDossier, eCatalogue and eInternal procedures). The modules/applications are integrated into a comprehensive system on a single platform that enables conducting public procurement procedures and techniques and instruments for electronic and aggregated procurement in a fully electronic way. </p><p>The <a href="https://ejn.gov.si/">eProcurement System e-JN</a> was built with different levels of interoperability in mind. It was designed based on interoperable IT solutions (horizontal building blocks) for data distribution, authentication and identification. It also uses web services, provided by Slovenian agencies, especially the AJPES (Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Public Legal Records and Related Services) which is responsible for the Slovenian Business register, the Official Public Gazette for eTendering and other institutions that provide data on economic operators. It is also connected with office and financial system software that is widely used in public administration. The public State-developed eProcurement system called <a href="https://ejn.gov.si/">Information System e-JN</a> is free of charge.</p><p class="subtitle">Remote Sessions</p><p>In April 2020, the <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/national-assembly/">National Assembly</a> of the Republic of Slovenia amended its Rules of Procedure to introduce, given the situation related to COVID-19, the possibility of holding <a href="https://idp.dz-rs.si/nidp/app/login?id=rba-internal&amp;sid=0&amp;option=credential&amp;sid=0">remote sessions</a> of the National Assembly and of its working bodies, which enables deputies and other guests from a remote location to participate equally in the session, which otherwise takes place in the National Assembly. The users connect to the system via a secure SSL connection, but a VPN connection can also be used. Before the session starts, they connect to a specific website and authenticate themselves using a two-factor login method with login name, a PIN and a password in the form of an SMS message. The solution enables business-friendly registration, participation in the debate, observance of the parliamentary hours and casting of votes with immediate final results that take into account the specific type of voting (simple majority, absolute majority, etc.). From their remote location, the users can see the room, monitor the parliamentary hour and see the results of the votes. In the event of a timeout, the system automatically interrupts the remote speech (as in the courtroom), and the speech of the remote participant can also be interrupted by the chairperson. The source of the image from the hall is a directed image, which is otherwise broadcast by the national television RTV SLO. Participants who are in the hall can see the speaker from a distance on the big screens, and hear the speech through the sound system. There is practically no delay in the connection. The chair and the secretary monitor attendance and requests to speak from remote locations. Other guests invited to the meeting are provided with the same functionality, except for voting.</p><p>The solution is used for plenary sessions, meetings of working bodies and the <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/national-council/">National Council</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">zVEM Portal and Mobile Application</p><p>The <a href="https://zvem.ezdrav.si">zVEM Portal</a> is a one-stop shop portal for patients. Patients can authenticate using a digital certificate and access the data that are stored on them in the eHealth databases. The zVEM Portal provides patients with full access to their healthcare documentation, referrals, appointments, prescriptions and records of dispensed medication. Using the eAppointment service, patients themselves can book the appointments for a number of medical services. The portal was enriched with newly developed eHealth services related to COVID-19 and patients can also access their EU Digital COVID Certificate. As of July 2021, a new mobile application zVEM is available. In addition to providing access to patient’s eHealth records, the mobile application also includes a digital wallet for storage of EU Digital COVID Certificates. There are 420 000 registered users on the patient portal and around 210 000 users on the mobile application. </p><p class="subtitle">ZVEMplus Portal for Healthcare Professionals</p><p><a href="https://zvem.ezdrav.si/plus/">zVEMplus</a> is a new web portal for healthcare professionals that was developed within the national eHealth services in 2021.

Since 2004, the system has allowed individuals and companies to log in using different electronic identifications. The system offers a number of eServices. The most important are: completing and submitting tax forms, declarations and returns, accessing the data on tax liabilities of taxable persons, electronic serving of documents, transfer of authorisations, etc. </p><p> </p><p>In 2018, the <a href="https://www.fu.gov.si/en/">eDavki Portal</a> was updated to a user-friendly version with easy access to information and eServices. In 2019, the eTax System introduced a simplified way of signing documents, i.e. without using a signature component and a qualified digital certificate. This enabled the eDavki Portal to be used on all operating systems and browsers and enabled expansion also on the mobile application. The development of this portal marked the start of the unification of the eDavki and the eCustoms portals. From 2019, individuals can use a new mobile app called <a href="https://www.fu.gov.si/davki_in_druge_dajatve/poslovanje_z_nami/e_davki/mobilna_aplikacija_edavki/">eDavki</a> that includes all eServices from the web portal eDavki plus additional eServices, such as a personalised calendar through which taxpayers receive notifications of their specific obligations and rights, pre-completed forms and assistance in completing forms, information on the settlement of social security contributions, etc. The eTax System is developed every year in a way that improves existing eServices or offers brand new eServices.</p><p> </p><p>In 2021, the majority of new eForms and eServices were connected with mitigating and remedying the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Slovenia has also increased the mobile application security, as they have enabled a two-factor authentication at login in eDavki mobile application.  </p><p class="subtitle">eCustoms Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://www.fu.gov.si/en/e_services?type=%3D17bb1b332b7d1cb8b0379b900f0a209c%3D8b79b09613ca367322153a1a63971862%3D82215450479817f3d85a3436d5b1150b%3Deec060e927badf8413c55f3a2424d6e0%27%29#c6792">eCustoms Portal</a> is Slovenia’s single-entry point to register and lodge customs declarations.

With this new arrangement, AJPES provides collected data for the purpose of keeping records of guests, for statistical purposes and for tax collection purposes.</p><p class="subtitle">Register of Deaths, Births and Marriages</p><p>The<a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO3354"> register</a> is a computerised <a href="https://podatki.gov.si/dataset/maticni-register?resource_id=fefc5c9b-298f-4563-b212-bbf8da506249">database</a> in which the following events are recorded: birth, marriage or partnership and death, as well as other facts provided for by law. The Civil Register shows the personal status of citizens of the Republic of Slovenia and a record of births, marriages or partnerships and deaths of foreign nationals who have occurred in the territory of the Republic of Slovenia. An integral part of the civil register is the collection of documents which form the basis for the entry in the civil register.  </p><p class="subtitle">Permanent Residence Register </p><p>Data on permanent and temporary residences in the Republic of Slovenia, permanent and temporary addresses abroad and addresses for service of individuals are kept, processed, stored and used in the <a href="https://podatki.gov.si/dataset/register-stalnega-prebivalstva">Register of Permanent Residence</a>. The recording of these data serves the purpose of monitoring the situation and movement of the population for those State authorities and other users who need these data to perform the prescribed task of ensuring electronic service, and for the purpose of carrying out statistical and other surveys provided for by law. Technical information on addresses are also kept in the permanent residence register. It is connected to the Register of Spatial Units, the Real Estate Register, the Building Cadastre, the Slovenian Business Register and other records, such as the Birth Register, the <a href="https://podatki.gov.si/dataset/register-stalnega-prebivalstva">Central Population Register</a>, the Register of Issued Identity Cards, Passports, etc.</p><p class="subtitle">Address Register</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/bodies-within-ministries/surveying-and-mapping-authority/">Surveying and Mapping Authority of Slovenia</a> is in charge of managing the <a href="https://eprostor.gov.si/imps/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/25e80f41-8348-4759-bac1-ec56c7223509">Address Register</a>, which is a part of the Register of Spatial Units. The following information shall be kept in the register of addresses: address number, title, centroid address and spatial units in the area in which the centroid of the address is located. The address number is an identification mark assigned by the Surveying and Mapping Authority. The address consists of the municipality, settlement, street, house number and additionally the house number and the apartment number or the number of the business premises, if any. The centroid of the address is determined within the floor plan of the building. The Address Register is connected to all the main State registers that use addresses (Population Register, Taxpayers Register, Business Register, Real Estate Register, etc.).</p><p class="subtitle">National Register of eInvoice Recipients </p><p>The <a href="https://e-register.gzs.si/GzsRpe/viewspublic/companySearch.xhtml">National Register of eInvoice Recipients</a> provides information about recipients of eInvoices and their method for receiving documents in a structured data format. It is open and allows connections to other systems to ensure organisations have a greater degree of automation when sending eInvoices. The National Register of eInvoice Recipients is managed by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia. The main purpose of the register is to support automation on the issuer’s side. It enables the simplification of eCommerce, reduces the possibility of errors and enables full automation of eInvoicing operations. All budget users are included into the National Register of eInvoice Recipients. </p><p class="subtitle">Spatial Data Sets</p><p>Slovenia is harmonising addresses, buildings, parcels, public infrastructure and topography registries with European requirements. This has also led to a <a href="http://www.gu.gov.si/en/services/free_access_database/">European Reference System, used in the Slovenian spatial data sets</a>, that enables interoperable, harmonised and ready to use data by all European bodies and institutions. </p><p class="subtitle">Central Vocabulary</p><p>The <a href="https://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/centralni+besednjak">Central Vocabulary</a> plays a key role in ensuring semantic interoperability. It uniformly and clearly defines the key terminology used in the public sector. The Central Vocabulary represents a repository of common code lists, upper ontologies, core vocabularies and base registries data models in RDF format. Their use as a base for extension is recommended for the development of sector-specific data models in the public sector. </p><p class="subtitle">Central Records of Applications</p><p>The Central Records of Applications (<a href="https://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/evidenca+aplikacij?lang=en">42EVA</a>) is an information support system for storing records that contain important metadata about installed applications. It also contains information about GDPR-compliant personal data processing in the applications. It enables the collection of important data about applications and their modules in one single place and in a structured way to prepare appropriate reviews and lists that can be useful in the decision-making process at different levels. Each user (with the appropriate rights) can either view the data directly or create an .xls file to view the data using Excel. 42EVA covers applications, modules, contracts/agreements and reports.

Using AI technologies like NLP, machine and deep learning, this new tool will support the comparison of structured and unstructured texts, analysing their meaning through concepts and terms analysis using the Semantic Text Analyser.</p><p>It will be used for preparing and updating vocabularies and to improve fast reading of government (and other) documents by the end of 2022. This is the first use case for this tool. Several additional ones have already been elaborated and will be implemented as follow-up projects. Most of them include functions for determining keywords and contexts of one or more texts, similarities and relations between texts or concepts from those texts, etc. The first two project phases or activities have been completed and the project is now entering its second part where user interfaces will be developed.
