The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-176.png" alt="35-176.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Denmark in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-177.jpeg" alt="35-177.jpeg" />	</p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Denmark’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and 9 (Multilingualism) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure all public services are accessible to all citizens, (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) and the implementation of multilingualism support in information systems (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p><img src="img/35-178.jpeg" alt="35-178.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Danish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show a high performance with scores of 4 in all principles. The only potential area of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance and organisational interoperability. Specifically, the score of 3 for Denmark in Recommendation 22, stating that public administrations should use a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assessing and selecting standards and specifications, and in Recommendation 29, calling for clarification and formalisation or organisational relationships for establishing and operating public services, could be improved for a total implementation of interoperability layers for Denmark.</p><p><img src="img/35-180.jpeg" alt="35-180.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Denmark’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a high performance in the implementation of the majority of recommendations associated with the conceptual model itself, the internal and external information sources and services, base registries, open data and catalogues. The only area for improvement is on security and privacy, more specifically in the implementation of Recommendation 47, on the use of Trust Services operating in accordance to the Regulation on eID, and the absence of Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (Recommendation 47) which hinders Denmark’s score on the Security and Privacy section.</p><p>Additional information on Denmark’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://www.kfst.dk/media/54435/the-public-procurement-act.pdf">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2020-egovernment-works-people">eGovernment Benchmark Report</a>, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

Furthermore, Denmark launched a new tech diplomacy strategy showing commitment to deploy <a href="https://techamb.um.dk/">tech diplomacy</a> with the ambition to embed democratic values in the international digital development.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Public Administration Legislation</p><p>In 2021, the government has evaluated the work with digital-ready legislation conducted over the last three years. The review indicates there is an increased focus on the application of new digital possibilities, and that several ministries find it advantageous to describe and incorporate digital solutions and possibilities in the early stages of the political decision-making process. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has underlined the benefits of digital-ready legislation and an evolved digital infrastructure. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital Public Administration Governance</p><p>Since 2018, the National ICT Council has conducted 28 reviews of central government’s ICT system portfolios. The central government institutions have mapped their ICT systems and created an overview of the challenges within each portfolio. By the end of 2021, all central government institutions will have mapped their system portfolios. This will provide an overview of the governmental ICT systems and the state of these. The overview will form the basis of future initiatives to improve governmental ICT management. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital Public Administration Infrastructure</p><p>The Danish public digital infrastructure has shown its worth during the COVID-19 pandemic. The digital infrastructure has enabled public service to remain at a high level even with a high degree of remote work within the state, regions and municipalities. Furthermore, the government has launched a range of new digital services to cope with COVID-19, including a contact-tracing app and digital booking of tests and vaccinations.</p><p>Moreover, since 24 November 2020, Danish citizens have been able to download their driving license in a new app and leave their physical driving license at home. With more than 500 000 downloads of the new app in the 24 hours after release, almost 750 000 in the first week, and now over 1 million, people in Denmark have quickly adopted the new digital driving license.</p><p><img src="img/35-281.jpeg" alt="35-281.jpeg" /></p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><p>3</p><p>	</p><h1><a id="_Toc39162704"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Danish government signed the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other EU Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies.

The partnership consists of top managers and experts from the Danish business community, the research community, civil society, stakeholders from the labour market and the municipal and regional administrative level. They will discuss and put forward recommendations on how Denmark should use the opportunities of digitalisation in the future.</p><p>The recommendations of the partnership will focus on how Denmark can leverage the opportunities of the digital transition, while preserving the best from Denmark's welfare society. The relation between digital transition and welfare, equality, growth and employment are some of the key areas the partnership will address.</p><p>The ambition is to make sure that all citizens, workers and private companies will have the opportunity to benefit from and take advantage of the increased digitalisation of the Danish society.</p><p>The partnership will also take into account other countries' experiences in the field of digitalisation, as well as digitalisation initiatives from the EU.</p><p class="subtitle">National Cyber and Information Security Strategy</p><p>The government is planning on launching a new national strategy for cyber and information security in 2021 to replace the current 2018−2021 strategy. The Danish government is currently building the strategy around four key themes:</p><ul><li>Management anchoring and competence building: encouraging management based on a thorough understanding, anchoring and prioritisation of cyber and information security; </li><li>Robustness and resilience: increasing the overall competences and knowledge of security issues across all sectors;</li><li>Cooperation and organisation: establishing strong cooperation among authorities and companies in order to promote knowledge sharing and common solutions, as well as increase the ability to respond to major cross-sector incidents; and</li><li>International efforts and contributions: Denmark is expected to partake in international cooperation and contribute to the creation of an open and secure Internet.</li></ul><p>This new national strategy is expected to increase the level of ambition both as regards the efforts of the industry and in relation to the national cross-sectoral commitments. </p><p>The strategy is developed by an inter-ministerial steering group with participation from all ministries. The chairmanship of the steering group is handled by the Danish Agency for Digitisation and the Centre for Cyber Security. Moreover, the National Cyber Security Council and the Business Partnership for Increased IT Security will be involved in order to provide their input to the strategy's overarching themes and possibly also to specific initiatives.</p><p class="subtitle">Strategy for Denmark’s Tech Diplomacy 2021−2023</p><p>In 2017, the Danish government appointed a Tech Ambassador with the aim to strengthen its access to, relations with and influence towards large tech companies across the world. Tech companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Tencent and Alibaba have an economic strength comparable to that of entire countries and affect our everyday lives. Diplomacy should take into account this reality.</p><p>In February 2021, the Danish government launched the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/egovernment-benchmark-2019-trust-government-increasingly-important-people">Strategy for Denmark’s Tech Diplomacy 2021−2023</a>. The strategy considers that democratic countries need to muster the courage to design and take charge of a framework for a responsible technological future, rather than leaving this task to a small cadre of companies. </p><p>The strategy comprises three principles that are central to future technological development:</p><ul><li>Responsibility is key and the tech industry should meet its societal responsibility and operate on a level-playing field;</li><li>Democracy should be the premise of governance, also in a digital world. Global digital governance should build on democratic values and human rights; and</li><li>Security is central and technology should support Denmark safety and security.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Strategy for Denmark’s Digital Growth</p><p>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database">Strategy for Denmark’s Digital Growth</a> encompasses a series of goals and actions fostering the digital transformation of Danish commerce and industry. More specifically, the strategy consists of 38 initiatives, allocating a total of DDK 1 billion from 2018 to 2025 in order to support the digital transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises. Subsequently, the strategy foresees a DKK 75 million investment per year. Some of the key actions that the strategy includes are the following:  </p><ul><li>Digital enhancement of SMEs; </li><li>Digital hub for stronger digital growth;</li><li>Digital skills for all; </li><li>Data as driver of growth in trade and industry; </li><li>Agile regulation in the areas of trade and industry; and </li><li>Increased cybersecurity within companies.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Guidelines on How to Make Legislation Ready for Digitisation</p><p>A broad political agreement was reached in January 2018, requiring all legislation proposed after 1 July 2018 to comply with seven principles for <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/selling-in-eu/index_en.htm">digital-ready legislation</a>. The <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/human-resources/index_en.htm">Guidelines on How to Make Legislation Digital-Ready</a> in particular outline <a href="http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do">seven principles</a> for digital-ready legislation and how to apply them in the legislative process. </p><p>Additionally, all proposed legislation must be assessed for potential implementation impacts in terms of project risk, organisational changes, data protection and citizens’ rights. The findings must be documented in the legislative proposal and mitigating measures should be described.</p><p>To ensure that legislation is digital-ready, every legislative proposal is screened for compliance with the guidelines and consultation responses are submitted to the responsible ministries by a unit established within the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>In support of this approach, a <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">course in digital-ready policymaking</a> will be generally available to legislative drafters and policy officers in government departments by the summer of 2021. </p><p>A report documenting the initiatives results was published in May 2021.</p><p class="subtitle">Public Sector Digitisation Strategy: a Stronger and More Secure Digital Denmark (2016–2020)</p><p>The <a href="http://www.borger.dk">Common Public Sector Digitisation Strategy</a> 2016–2020 (also known as Digital Strategy) was agreed upon by the Danish government, <a href="https://www.kl.dk/english/kl-local-government-denmark/">Local Government Denmark</a> and Danish Regions, and entered into force in May 2016. The goal of the strategy was to help shape the digital Denmark of the future and ensure that the public sector was prepared to seize technological opportunities. </p><p>The strategy covered numerous themes related to the digitisation of the public sector, such as automation of public administrative procedures, better user experience for citizens and businesses, digital welfare, data sharing, and others.</p><p>In 2021, a new set of initiatives has been agreed upon by the Danish government, <a href="https://www.kl.dk/english/kl-local-government-denmark/">Local Government Denmark</a> and Danish Regions, with the purpose of extending and strengthening the main goals of the Digital Strategy throughout 2021. </p><p>In this context, a new Common Public Sector Digitisation Strategy is to be launched in the near future. The new strategy will set out new ambitious goals for the future development and improvement of digital welfare solutions to the benefit of citizens and businesses, with the aim to use data and new technologies effectively in the fight against climate change and to guarantee better conditions for a more innovative and interconnected public sector, among others.</p><p class="subtitle">Strategy for ICT Management in Central Government</p><p>A <a href="https://en.digst.dk/policy-and-strategy/strategy-for-ict-management/">Strategy for ICT Management in Central Government</a> was launched on 21 November 2017, aiming to improve the operational management of information and communication technology (ICT) systems. The 13 initiatives forming the framework for a better management of ICT systems address issues such as the mandatory compliance to the central government’s ICT system portfolio management model and the periodic review by the National ICT Council of each ministry’s ICT system management. The initiatives also address the formation of cross-governmental network activities amongst leaders and employees working with digitisation and developing the technical and professional competencies and skills required to manage ICT.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">Common Framework for Public-Sector Digital Architecture (Danish NIF)</p><p>In 2017, Danish local, regional and governmental authorities agreed on a common <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/isa/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf"> Federal Digital Architecture</a> (FDA) that focuses on data sharing and cross-organisational processes. The FDA includes a general framework as well as a number of specific architecture assets.</p><p>The core of the FDA framework is constituted of a set of general architecture principles and rules supported by guidelines on architecture description and communication, including common rules for concept and data modelling. Activities such as skill development, architecture guidance and project reviews support the adoption of the common framework. </p><p>The FDA includes a number of concrete architecture assets. This includes reference architectures on common issues such as the sharing of data and documents, user and rights management across domains, coherent user journeys in relation to digital self-services, and user-centric and cross-cutting overview of data relevant to each citizen and enterprise (e.g. in relation to cases, payments, debt, appointments and deadlines). </p><p>Finally, the FDA encompasses a number of common technical solutions such as the national infrastructure solutions for ID, Digital Signature, Single Sign On and Digital Post, among others.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/isa2programme">general governance structure</a> is based on voluntary use depending on relevance, logic and business case. Some elements, such as digital signature and digital post, are required by law. Projects falling within the common public sector strategies shall take the FDA into account and undergo a FDA architecture-review. </p><p class="subtitle">Rules for Concept and Data Modelling</p><p>It is important that authorities and businesses are able to retrieve, understand and use data originating from other authorities. Therefore, the Common Public-Sector Digital Architecture recommends applying the <a href="https://digst.dk/it-loesninger/eid-gateway/">Rules for Concept and Data Modelling</a> to document concepts and data. The rules ensure that concepts and data are described and documented thoroughly, correctly and consistently whilst reusing national and international models, standards and experiences to the extent possible. </p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>Open Government Partnership Action Plan (2019–2021)</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://twitter.com/EU_ISA2">Open Government Partnership</a>, an international collaboration, the Danish government drafted a fourth <a href="https://twitter.com/Joinup_eu">National Action Plan (2019–2021)</a> containing seven initiatives from various parts of the Danish public sector.</p><p>The Action Plan aims to strengthen trust and transparency in public authorities, especially in public digitisation.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>NOBID Project</p><p>Denmark is a member of the Nordic-Baltic Cooperation on Digital Identities (NOBID), a project governed by the Nordic Council of Ministers supporting the implementation and utilisation of the national eID infrastructure.

The focus of these initiatives is the standardisation of electronic procurement documents related particularly to eCatalogues and eOrders.</p><p>The implementation of the project concerning an increased adoption of eCatalogues and eOrders was initiated in January 2019 and is scheduled to end in 2023. It mandates the use of eCatalogues and eOrders for central and sub-central purchasing bodies when employees procure certain goods.</p><p class="subtitle">Rules for Concept and Data Modelling </p><p>Denmark’s<a href="file:///C:/Users/B017912/Downloads/Strategy-for-Denmarks-Tech-Diplomacy-2021-2023.pdf"> Rules for Concept and Data Modelling</a> ensure that concepts and data are thoroughly and correctly described and documented.

As a result of the strategy, regions are now investing in developing and replacing electronic health record systems and municipalities are radically changing the way they use health data by implementing structured electronic medical records.</p><p>In this way, the Digital Health Strategy lays the groundwork for a joint digitisation effort for the entire Danish health system. By strengthening the common digital foundation for the provision of healthcare across the sector, the strategy also aims to maintain and reinforce the security of personal health data and to enable the safe and secure exchange of relevant data across the health sector.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging Technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Artificial Intelligence</p><p>Denmark’s recent efforts in the area of emerging technologies focused on artificial intelligence (AI).

The work is ongoing and divided into different sections.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">Legislative Focus on Interoperability</p><p>Most Danish digitisation initiatives are developed with a focus on ensuring interoperability across different solutions. This is reflected in most of the legislation described in this chapter, which covers cross-sector solutions (e.g. as described in sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.4). An example is offered by the legislation providing guidelines for the use of the Danish cross-sectional eID solution NemID (<a href="https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2018/439">Act No. 439 of 08 May 2018</a> and <a href="https://arkitektur.digst.dk/">Act No. 899 of 21 June 2018</a>).</p><p class="subtitle">Single Digital Gateway</p><p>In Denmark, the Danish Business Authority and the Danish Agency for Digitisation share the responsibility for coordinating and implementing the <a href="https://arkitektur.digst.dk/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;toc=OJ:L:2018:295:TOC">Single Digital Gateway (SDG) Regulation</a>. </p><p>Currently, Denmark has not yet clarified whether legislation will have to be amended in order to comply with the SDG.

The new act is applicable to central, regional and municipal authorities and, as opposed to the previous act, also to companies in which the government has a substantial ownership interest, companies making decisions on behalf of the government, Local Government Denmark (KL, i.e. the association of municipalities) and Danish Regions (<em>Danske Regioner,</em> i.e. the association of regions).</p><p>The act allows any person<strong> </strong>to request documents from an administrative file. Authorities must respond as soon as possible to such requests and, if this exchange takes longer than seven days, they must inform the requestor of the reasons why the response is delayed and when an answer is to be expected. </p><p>Non-disclosure, however, is allowed for Courts or legislators: all documents produced by these entities are exempted from the provisions of the act. The same applies to documents relating to the security of the State, the defence of the Realm, the protection of foreign policy, law enforcement, taxation and the public financial interests. In case of non-disclosure, complaints can be lodged with the Parliamentary Ombudsman, who can issue non-binding opinions recommending that documents be released. </p><p class="subtitle">Act Amending the Law on the Reuse of Public Sector Information</p><p>The <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/members/denmark/?id=163488">Act Amending the Law on the Reuse of Public Sector Information</a> of 2 June 2014 implements <a href="https://statens-it.dk/english/?uri=CELEX:32013L0037&amp;from=EN">Directive 37/2013/EU of 26 June 2013 amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re-use of public sector information</a>.

As a result of the Digitisation Strategy and the Digitisation Pact, the Agency for Digitisation hosts three <a href="https://www.devex.com/organizations/ministry-of-climate-energy-and-utilities-denmark-141050">steering committees</a> within Digital Infrastructure, Digital Communication, and Technology and Data. The steering committees, which include different authorities, work to ensure interoperability and coherence within public digitisation.  </p><p>In addition to the three main committees, the Agency for Digitisation is also represented in several different topic-specific steering committees, e.g. within cyber and information security, basic data, etc. </p><h3>Base Registry coordination</h3><p class="subtitle">Data Distributor – Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency</p><p>In Denmark, the <a href="http://www.digst.dk/">Data Distributor</a> acts as a data hub for basic data and base registries. The Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency is the authority in charge of the Data Distributor. However, a wide range of authorities collects and distributes basic data from different sources and therefore there are many different authorities providing data to the Data Distributor. These include, but are not limited to, the <a href="https://eng.sdfe.dk/">Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency</a>, the <a href="https://gst.dk">Danish Geodata Agency</a>, the <a href="https://erhvervsstyrelsen.dk/">Danish Business Authority</a>, the <a href="http://www.statens-it.dk">Social Security Office</a>, <a href="http://uk.fm.dk/">the Danish Agency for Digitisation</a> and the <a href="http://uk.fm.dk/">Tax Authority</a>.</p><h3>Audit</h3><p class="subtitle">National Audit Office of Denmark</p><p>The <a href="http://uk.fm.dk/">National Audit Office of Denmark</a> is a public institution whose primary task is to audit the State accounts and to examine whether State funds are administered in accordance with the decisions of the Parliament.

Crucial for the government's cooperation with municipalities and regions are the annual budget agreements between the central government and the organisations representing subnational government, i.e. Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions. The annual budget agreements cover the yearly economic arrangements and several other <a href="http://www.fm.dk/Arbejdsomraader/Kommuner og regioner/Opgaver for kommuner og regioner.aspx">aspects</a>, some of which are related to eGovernment and the public sector digitisation. The Ministry of Finance, with the involvement of several other ministries, is responsible for coordinating these annual negotiations between the government and, respectively, Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions, and following up on agreements concerning eGovernment and related projects. </p><h3>Implementation</h3><p class="subtitle">Municipalities and Regions</p><p>The <a href="mailto:digst@digst.dk">98 municipalities</a> are responsible for carrying out most tasks related to citizen service delivery, including social services, childcare, elderly care, health care, employment, culture, environment and planning.

The portal is a shared infrastructure and is funded by national, regional and local authorities. The Citizen Portal also contains an English <a href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/">sub-site for international citizens</a>. The Citizen Portal provides general, location-specific (e.g. region or municipality) and personal information, data and eServices for citizens, including access to Digital Post (more information on Digital Post below). In addition, the Citizen Portal features a range of ‘self-service’ solutions, allowing citizens to manage their communications with the public sector effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, a single sign-on solution allows citizens to receive and access information and services from several agencies, without having to log on several times.</p><p>The portal currently contains more than 2 000 self-service solutions. In 2020, a total of 58.7 million visits were reported in the portal (with a population of 5.8 million citizens). The Citizen Portal offers a user-friendly interface, personalisation of content and syndication of borger.dk content, as well as flexibility for authorities wishing to add location-specific content to the portal. The most recent user survey shows that 92% of the users are ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with the Citizen Portal and 92% of the users feel at ease using it.</p><p class="subtitle">My Overview</p><p>My Overview is the citizens’ personal page on the Citizen Portal. Here, citizens can log on using their NemID (eID solution) to grant access to some of the information public authorities hold on them, such as information on tax, debt, student grants or housing as well as status on benefits and ongoing cases with public authorities, upcoming agreements and deadlines.  </p><p>The development of My Overview is part of a joint public political vision for creating transparency, and a better and more coherent digital service. The aim is to gather and display relevant data about each citizen across the public sector. The overview is personalised and therefore no one but the citizen has access to the data on the site. My Overview will not replace existing websites or self-service solutions but will be a supplement offering a wider digital overview of a citizen’s data and interactions with the public sector as well as links to the relevant public websites. New public authorities will join My Overview every year and display relevant information and data to citizens.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Guides to Life Events</p><p>The Danish Agency for Digitisation and the Danish Business Authority are developing Digital Guides to support coherent user journeys in relation to the eleven most common life events for <a href="https://digiplace.sharepoint.com/sites/WE-EUROPEANCOMMISSION-ABCIV-SC442/Shared Documents/D04.01 Digital Public Administration factsheets and infographics/Country factsheets 2021/Denmark/Factsheet/-	www.borger.dk/flytteguide">citizens</a> and ten most common life events for <a href="https://virk.dk/assistent">businesses</a>. The Guides provide citizens and businesses with an overview of what they need to know and understand regarding their life event and give them a collection of relevant links to i.e. public services and self-service solutions. The Guides are published on the portals <a href="https://cpr.dk/">borger.dk</a> (citizens) and virk.dk (businesses). The Guides will be further developed as new user needs are identified, and so will be the architecture supporting the Guides. </p><p class="subtitle">Virk.dk - Business Portal</p><p>The business portal <a href="file:///C:/Users/B061967/AppData/Roaming/cBrain/F2/Temp/4942902/en.digst.dk">Virk.dk</a> is the common public<strong> </strong>web portal<strong> </strong>for<strong> </strong>businesses, allowing them to handle their reporting obligations towards the public sector. The overall objective of Virk.dk is to relieve Danish businesses from administrative burdens and provide a single entrance to the public sector. The Portal contains more than 1 000 eForms, and in 2020 user sessions on Virk.dk totalled 23 million.</p><p>Virk.dk also features a personalised dashboard for businesses to provide them with an overview of current deadlines, tasks and obligations towards public authorities. The dashboard contains basic information on the business, a calendar, access to Digital Post, access to the user administration interface and a few services with information from specific public authorities. The dashboard is continuously expanded with new services. </p><p>In addition to Virk.dk, a Business Promotion Portal called ‘<a href="http://www.regioner.dk/">The Business Guide’ (<em>Virksomhedsguiden</em>)</a> was launched in 2019, aiming to provide information and services to start ups and businesses in Denmark on how to start, run and develop a business. The platform gathers guidance on the most relevant business regulations from more than 16 different authorities, as well as guidance on starting, running and developing a business. At the launch, the platform contained more than 150 digital articles and tools, spanning from regulation on how to hire your first employee and how to pay VAT to how to improve your sales technique and how to write a business plan. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital Post</p><p>Digital Post is the public authorities' shared IT solution that enables to communicate securely with citizens, companies, and other governmental institutions.</p><p>In Denmark today, approx. 4.4 million citizens and approx. 680 000 businesses use and receive Digital Post, and approx. 400 authorities are part of the system and use it to send Digital Post messages. </p><p>In November 2021, Denmark will be getting a new Digital Post solution. The public sector will have increased ownership of the new Digital Post solution, which will provide greater flexibility, adapt to future needs and ensure better coherence with other public IT solutions.</p><p>The new Digital Post will resemble the current solution, so that the many citizens and companies that currently use Digital Post today will experience an improved, coherent, and easily accessible IT solution based on user-friendliness.</p><p class="subtitle">Real Property Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/">Real Property Portal</a> contains articles, step-by-step guides, tools and documents designed to make it easier and more secure for users, i.e., businesses and citizens, to sell or buy homes. The portal also provides an overview of the buying and selling processes at work. The portal thus offers an insight into housing transaction processes designed to prepare the property owner to engage with professional advisers. Several tools and documents enable property owners to carry out parts of a housing transaction single-handedly. Furthermore, property owners get access to large national databases containing data about buildings and can get acquainted with/or updated on rules regarding business rentals, purchase and rental of summer houses and holiday homes as well as real estate services.</p><p class="subtitle">‘Live’ Operational Status</p><p>On the site <a href="http://www.datatilsynet.dk/english/">Digitalisér.dk/services</a>, businesses and citizens are able to see the operational status ‘live’ on common public sector digital services. The operational status service covers the following public key services: the Single-Sign-In solution <a href="https://rm.coe.int/16806af0e6">NemLogin</a>; the eID/digital signature solution <a href="http://www.kl.dk/English/Local-Government-Denmark/">NemID</a>; the national Citizen Portal <a href="https://virksomhedsguiden.dk/erhvervsfremme/content/">borger.dk</a>; the eCommerce register solution <a href="http://www.nemhandel.dk/">NemHandel</a>; the bank account register for public sector transfers <a href="https://www.nemkonto.dk/">NemKonto</a>; and <a href="https://www.borger.dk/internet-og-sikkerhed/Digital-Post/Post">Digital Post</a>, i.e. the mandatory digital letterbox for communicating with public authorities.</p><p class="subtitle">National Portal for Cyber and Information Security</p><p>An information portal, <a href="https://fm.dk/arbejdsomraader/kommuner-og-regioner/opgaver-for-kommuner-og-regioner/">sikkerdigital.dk</a>, has been established with readily accessible information, advice and specific tools for citizens, businesses and authorities regarding information security and data protection, as well as information on how to comply with current legislation in those fields. The portal is managed jointly by the Agency for Digitisation and the Danish Business Authority in collaboration with various other authorities and NGOs.</p><h3>Subnational Portals</h3><p class="subtitle">Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions</p><p>One of the overall objectives of digitisation in Denmark is to associate the relevant levels of government. Thus, LGDK and DR are also involved in several of the nationally operated portals, e.g. borger.dk and sikkerdigital.dk.</p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle">Broadband Speed</p><p>Denmark has good high-speed broadband coverage, also in rural areas. The broadband target set at political level (all households and businesses shall have access to 100/30 Mbps in 2020) was confirmed in 2018 and is currently being updated. Currently, 94% of all households and businesses are covered with a minimum speed of 100/30 Mbps and 86% have a 1 Gbit/s coverage. An ambitious commercial roll-out of high-speed fixed broadband is expected. Consequently, a recent forecast estimates that 98-99% of all households and businesses will be covered with fixed high-speed broadband in the mid 2020’s. 5G is currently being rolled out and one mobile operator has already made its 5G-network available nation-wide for commercial access. Three other operators are in the deployment phase and have made their networks available in the largest cities.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Data Distributor</p><p>The <a href="http://www.kl.dk/English/Local-Government-Denmark/">Data Distributor</a> is the distribution channel making basic data from several authorities accessible for businesses, government and citizens.</p><p>Data Distributor replaces a series of public distribution solutions and ensures that authorities and companies are provided with easy and safe access to basic data in one collective system, rather than resorting to many different systems and interfaces. By now, the Data Distributor samples a unique variety of basic data, e.g. civil registration numbers, registered data on land, properties, parcels and buildings, registered data on companies, registered data on addresses, administrative divisions and place names, geographical base maps, geodata, etc.</p><p>A modern, stable and easily accessible distribution of registered basic data is essential if the Basic Data Programme is to reach its goal of improving, modernising and increasing the efficiency of the Danish public sector management. Better data and better distribution also create better conditions for innovation and growth in private companies. More data will be constantly made available on the Data Distributor.</p><p class="subtitle">Reference Architecture for Sharing Data and Documents</p><p>Denmark has published a reference architecture to facilitate the sharing of data and documents electronically. The reference architecture revolves around describing the disclosure of data by transmission. Disclosure by transmission focuses on the actual action of passing on data, whereas the interpretation of the sharing of data is broader and includes making data available for potential reuse, even if data may never be accessed. A main purpose of this reference architecture is to guide and assist in the choice between two fundamental business patterns for the disclosure of data by transmission:</p><ul><li>Transmission on request: typically, system-to-system integrations using an API; and</li><li>Transmission by message: typically, the legally binding communication of data (possibly in the form of documents) from public authorities to citizens and businesses, but also a classical pattern in system-to-system integrations.</li></ul><p>The fundamental difference between these two scenarios is, whether it is the actor transmitting data or the actor receiving data, who is responsible for the concrete data process flow.</p><p class="subtitle">New Application Profiles</p><p>A Danish application profile of version 2.0 of the <a href="https://www.regioner.dk/">DCAT Application Profile</a> for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP) has been completed and approved for use in the context of the Danish public sector (DCAT-AP-DK). </p><p>Furthermore, to support higher reuse and quality of metadata about IT systems, two application profiles have been established: a Basic Application Profile describing the core properties of public sector IT systems and an Archive Application Profile extending the basic profile elements relevant to the submission of information about IT systems to the National Archives.</p><p>In addition, a method for describing Dataset Quality has been established. The method has been developed on the basis of international standards such as the W3C Data on the Web Best Practices, including the Data Quality Vocabulary, and ISO 25012 on Data Quality.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">NemID Digital Signature</p><p>Since 1 July 2010, <a href="https://en.digst.dk/data-and-it-architecture/">NemID</a>, the national digital signature, has provided easy and safe access to a wide range of public and private self-service solutions on the web, including eBanking, tax forms, insurance and pension funds. With this digital signature, citizens use the same user ID and the same password for online banking, government websites and a wide range of private services online. NemID is the result of the collaboration between the state, municipalities and regions, the financial sector, and a private contractor. More than 5.2 million personal NemIDs have been issued to citizens from the age of 15 and up. In addition, NemID can now be used by business-owners in more than half a million companies as a way to log in to digital self-service solutions (for example <a href="https://ast.dk/">Virk</a> and <a href="http://www.datatilsynet.dk/english/">Digital Post</a>) on behalf of the business entity, making reporting to the public sector easier, especially for SMEs. Previously, a NemID Employee Certificate was the only electronic key to digital self-service solutions.</p><p>In cooperation with the <a href="https://datafordeler.dk/">Danish Association of the Blind</a>, a special solution was also developed for blind and partially sighted people.</p><p>During 2021, Denmark expects to migrate to the next generation of the eID, called MitID, which directly translates into MyID. The MitID solution is developed in partnership with Finance Denmark, the Danish business association for banks and other financial institutions in Denmark.</p><p class="subtitle">eIDAS eID-Gateway Node</p><p>The Danish eIDAS infrastructure, called the <a href="https://www.digitaliser.dk/">eID-Gateway</a>, went into production on 28 August 2019. The eID-Gateway consists of the DK eIDAS Connector and the DK eIDAS Service. Currently, 69 eServices are connected to the DK eIDAS Connector and work is in progress to integrate other notified eIDs. The eID-Gateway is connected to existing eServices and utilises the existing national SAML protocol, which is also implemented in the national broker for public services, NemLog-in, described further down. Denmark was one of the first countries to recognise the German eID and by the end of 2020 citizens from eleven different EU Member States were able to access Danish eServices, with more following in 2021. Work is continuing to provide solutions for identity matching as well as supporting businesses and their employees in accessing connected eServices.</p><p>Work is also progressing to support the national implementation of the Single Digital Gateway and to prepare for the integration of Danish eServices into the national eID-infrastructure. </p><p>In April 2020, Denmark completed the process of notifying the Danish eID, NemID, in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market with the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU). Denmark is still finalising the implementation of the necessary technical changes in the NemID infrastructure, in order for the other EU Member States to begin integration to the NemID in their respective eIDAS nodes.</p><p class="subtitle">NemLog-in: Sign-In Solution</p><p>NemLog-in is a vital part of the public infrastructure and is the primary joint identity broker/identity provider solution. It also serves as integration point for public IT service providers and self-service solutions.</p><p>NemLog-in consists of a number of components that make up the Danish national platform for login and user access management. Established in 2008, NemLog-in is today in its third generation with over 150 IT service providers. It offers 500 self-service solutions and records more than a 100 million logins a year. One of the primary components is a login/authentication service with Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality. Citizens, employees in companies and authorities can log on to public self-services solutions and portals. Other NemLog-in components include central user access management, a signing service (incl. signature validation and possibly long-term storage), a power of attorney functionality and a Security Token Service (STS) functionality. Lastly, NemLog-in provides an administration component, where IT service providers and IT vendors can maintain their self-service solution integrations to NemLog-in.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474994"></a>Procurement Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.udbudsportalen.dk/">Procurement Portal</a> offers public and private providers guidance on the knowledge and tools necessary for the provision of tendering services. The purpose of the Portal is to facilitate cooperation between enterprises and the public sector as a means to promote public services efficiently. Furthermore, some regional and local authorities make use of private marketplaces. The State-owned company <a href="http://www.ski.dk">National Procurement Ltd (SKI)</a> has set up simpler eTendering solutions systems (<em><a href="https://www.ethics.dk/ethics/eo&quot; \l &quot;/SKI/">NetIndkøb</a></em> <em>&amp;</em> <em>Netkatalog</em>).</p><p class="subtitle"><em>Nemhandel</em></p><p><em>Nemhandel</em> is an open network with its own document standards, making eProcurement between suppliers of goods and public authorities and institutions easy, secure and efficient. <em>Nemhandel</em> functions as one common standard for eProcurement and makes it possible for all businesses to connect once and reach all - irrespective of the purchasing system or the IT service provider.</p><p><em>Nemhandel</em> has continuously and actively participated in European and international cooperation for e-procurement. In 2017, <em>Nemhandel</em> began to be integrated into Peppol, and in the years 2019 and 2020, it became mandatory for all public authorities to be affiliated to the Peppol network, via the <em>Nemhandel</em> Registry, which is also a Peppol registry. From January 2023, Peppol-based eCatalogues and eOrders will also be mandatory for public entities for certain categories of goods and services.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Driving License App (<em>Kørekort-appen</em>) and Digital Health Card</p><p>Since 24 November 2020, Danish citizens have been able to download their driving license in a new app and leave their physical driving license at home.</p><p>With more than 500 000 downloads of the new app in the 24 hours after its release, almost 750 000 in the first week, and now over 1 million, Danish citizens have quickly adopted the new digital driving license.</p><p>Citizens who wish to subscribe to the app must possess a Danish driving licences, a NemID (the official digital signature (eID) for public digital services) and a Danish passport. Users simply log in with their eID and scan their passport in order to download the passport photo to their driving license app. </p><p>The app has a built-in QR-code that enables the Danish police to use their dedicated app to confirm the digital driving license validity without touching the driver's phone. The app also displays a secondary QR-code with less information, which can be used as proof of identity, for instance to buy age-restricted products or pick up a parcel at the post office. The digital driving license app is only valid within the Danish borders.</p><p>The Agency for Digitisation followed up the launch of the Digital Driving License App with yet another digitised version of Danish citizens' universally issued ID-cards: in June 2021 the Agency launched the ‘Yellow Health Insurance Card’, that entitles Danish citizens to medical treatment in Denmark </p><p>Neither the digital driving license app nor the Digital Health Card will replace the physical ID-cards. Physical driving licenses will still be assigned upon passing the driving test, and the health insurance card will also be issued physically. </p><p class="subtitle">Corona Passport</p><p>In May 2021, the Danish Health Ministry, launched the <a href="https://www.borger.dk/">new Corona Passport App</a>, which is designed to make everyday life as easy as possible for citizens in Denmark during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the Corona Passport App, citizens can easily present test results, vaccination or immunity passports, in a safe, reliable and privacy-respecting manner. The Corona Passport Mobile App thus ensures quick and easy admission to restaurants, cultural venues or similar establishments.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">NemKonto</p><p>Most Danish citizens and companies occasionally receive payments from the public sector. These payments can be TAX or VAT refunds, child subsidies, pensions, student loans, unemployment benefits, housing support or social welfare payments etc. All payments from public institutions will be transferred directly to what is called a NemKonto account. </p><p>All citizens and companies registered in Demark are required to have a NemKonto. A NemKonto is a normal bank account that you assign as your NemKonto. Some private enterprises such as insurance and pension companies, are also able to make payments to a NemKonto as well. </p><h2>Knowledge Management<a id="_Toc1474997"></a></h2><p class="subtitle">Information Repository and Platform for Collaboration</p><p><a href="https://indberet.virk.dk/">Arkitektur.digst.dk</a> is the central repository for shared public reference architecture models, data standards and general advice developed to support work on architectures in the digitisation of public authorities. The site is developed by the central government and local government authorities in cooperation. </p><p>To ensure continuity with previous work, the site is linked with its predecessor, <a href="https://www.borger.dk/">Digitalisér.dk</a>, including previous repositories of information on<strong> </strong>data interchange standards for the public and private sectors and a collaboration tool for the development of the information society in Denmark. The main purpose is to support the exchange and reuse of data related to public and private service delivery, including cooperation, business reengineering and alignment of related services. The site also presents relevant shared resources such as data model catalogues and a list of the most prominent data distributors in the Danish public sector.</p><p class="subtitle">Danish catalogue of datasets</p><p>A <a href="http://www.boligejer.dk/">dataset catalogue</a> has been established as a web-based platform by the <a href="https://www.digitaliser.dk/services">Agency for Digitisation</a>. The purpose of the platform is to make it easy for authorities to describe their datasets in a consistent manner while also providing an overview of public sector datasets. </p><p>At the moment, the platform only provides an overview of a minority of the public datasets. A continued effort was  established in the fall 2020 to ensure that more public datasets are presented on the platform. The platform guides data users to access public datasets through a direct link to the dataset or to a landing page. The platform does not distribute the datasets, but provides metadata about the datasets. In addition, where possible, the Catalogue provides contact information so that data users can contact data custodians for additional information, if needed.</p><p class="subtitle">Danish Catalogue of Data Distributors</p><p>Because of the parallel development of a Danish digital public sector, many agencies and ministries need to share specialised data, which has resulted in a diverse and specialised ecosystem of dedicated data distributors that allows for citizens, businesses and public organisations to access public resources. In the data distributor catalogue, interested parties can now find the access points for 18 of the most prominent data distributors. The list grows as data distribution becomes increasingly professionalised in more public organisations, which are growing aware of their role as data distributors.</p><h2>Cross-Border Platforms<a id="_Toc1474998"></a></h2><p class="subtitle">Government Cloud Services and CEF eDelivery Services</p><p>Work is currently being undertaken to support the public sector use of cloud offerings, including the guidance on the use of cloud services published in November 2019 and the provision of various cloud offerings to government bodies serviced by the Agency for Governmental IT Services.</p><p>CEF eDelivery is implemented to support various cross-border domain solutions such as eInvoicing and Business Register Interconnected Systems and it is also expected to be used for the Single Digital Gateway Once Only Technical System.</p><p>The TESTA network is used for a number of cross-border use cases.</p><h2>Base Registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Base Registry Data available on the Data Distributor </p><p>The Danish Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency is responsible for cross-public coordination of base registry data and it is also responsible for the Data Distributor.

In order to do so, Your Europe offers information on basic rights under EU law, but also on how these rights are implemented in each individual country (where information has been provided by the national authorities). Free email or telephone contact with EU assistance services, to get more personalised or detailed help and advice is also available.</p><p>Please note that, in most cases, the EU rights described in Your Europe apply to all EU member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and sometimes to Switzerland. Information on Your Europe is provided by the relevant departments of the European Commission and complemented by content provided by the authorities of every country it covers.
