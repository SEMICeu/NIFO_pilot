The strategy explained how the digitalisation policy contributed to competitiveness, full employment and economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development in the society. The strategy set the focus on the government's digitalisation policy.</p><p>To achieve the overall objective of Sweden of becoming a world leader in harnessing the opportunities of digital transformation, the strategy contained five goals: </p><ul><li>Enhancing the digital skills of the people, so as to enable them to actively participate in the digital transformation;</li><li>Increase digital security, and thus the trust and confidence of people in using digital services;</li><li>Fostering digital innovation by creating the competitive conditions for the development and spread of new or improved products and services of value to people and businesses;</li><li>Improving digital leadership, which entails better governance, but also measurement and follow-up activities;</li><li>Reinforcement of the digital infrastructure, such as broadband infrastructure, which is crucial for transmitting data.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Programme for the digital revival of the public sector: Digital First (2016 – 2018) </p><p>The goal of the programme is to make Sweden the best in the world in the use of digitalisation opportunities. The work of the programme is driven by several agencies that are involved in monitoring and facilitating progress in different sectors of the economy. </p><p>The Swedish government sees digitalisation as the largest individual change factor that affects all parts of society. The objective of the ICT policy is clear – Sweden shall become the best in the world in using digitalisation opportunities. The main sub-targets of the government are: </p><ul><li>Achieving easier living for citizens; </li><li>More open public management that supports innovation and citizen participation;</li><li>Higher quality and efficiency in public management. </li></ul><p>The programme also implies that provision of digital services should be the first choice in the State’s relations with citizens and businesses, where relevant and possible. Digital First operates in three key priority areas: </p><ul><li>Digital Revival – control and digital maturity; </li><li>A smarter Sweden – innovative digital services; </li><li>A stable base – a national digital infrastructure.</li></ul><p>In September 2018 a new agency, DIGG, was established to serve as a hub for digitalisation of the public sector. The aim is to improve the coordination of public sector digitisation and support it at both central, regional and local level. One important task is to coordinate, develop, manage and provide a national digital infrastructure for the public sector and to support expertise within the area. Tasks from several other central government agencies have been transferred to DIGG.</p><p class="subtitle">Putting the citizen at the centre (2012 – present)</p><p>The Swedish Government Strategy for Collaborative Digital Services in Government Administration, <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/informationsmaterial/2015/04/med-medborgaren-i-centrum/">Putting the Citizen at the Centre</a>, was launched in December 2012. This strategy described how the Swedish Government planned to further strengthen the ability of government agencies to work together in delivering digital services. More common digital services in the daily lives of both citizens and businesses were further simplified. These digital services must be developed in a user-centric way: simple and secure to use, and easily accessible to everyone. Innovation was enhanced by making it easier to find and use re-usable public information and digital services with interfaces that can be used by other systems. The publication of public sector information on the Internet and the use of social media promoted both transparency and citizen involvement. Quality and efficiency in government administration was increased through standardised information management, better information security and digitised processes. Such internal efficiency and service in developing digital services must always be conditional to the protection of personal privacy and the need for confidentiality. The above objectives formed the basis of the Swedish Government’s coordination and prioritising of the development of inter-agency cross-sectorial projects.  </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Strategic assignment on open data and artificial intelligence</p><p>The Swedish government embarked on an <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/49a186/contentassets/ba64455f7f9e435b8cb5b675d3681bf7/uppdrag-att-oka-den-offentliga-forvaltningens-formaga-att-tillgangliggora-oppna-data.pdf">assignment</a> to further the goals of data and artificial intelligence.

It can be used as proof of identity and citizenship and as a valid travel document within the Schengen area. It complies with ICAO standards for biometric travel documents; it is issued by passport offices and manufactured by the same supplier as the biometric passport.

Therefore, Swedish citizens have been using non-official electronic ID cards issued by different providers, e.g. software-based electronic IDs like the BankID (developed by the largest Swedish banks), Telia and Freja eID+ to access certain eGovernment services. Any physical person with a Swedish personal identity number (a unique identification number for Swedish citizens) can obtain an eID. This number appears on the eID and its microchip.</p><p>Legal entities can also use an eID. In this case, two types of certificates come into question, namely the server and stamping certificates, for authentication and signing respectively. The certificates contain the name of the organisation and the organisational number and may also contain a URL.

The central eProcurement authorities’ role consists on monitoring the supplied services and complying with standards. In general, the Swedish Government has not implemented a central electronic public procurement portal, as this is deliberately left up to private operators. Several privately owned and operated portals exist instead, some of which concentrate on public procurement (e.g. <a href="https://www.opic.com/">Opic</a> and <a href="https://www.visma.com/">Visma</a>).</p><p class="subtitle">Information on coordinated public sector framework agreements</p><p>The <a href="https://www.avropa.se/topplankar/In-English/">avropa.se</a> portal, maintained by the National Procurement Services, serves as an information database on the different framework agreements which were procured centrally by National Procurement Services. The portal is available to national authorities, government agencies, regions and municipalities. </p><p>An agency can thus use the information portal to locate the necessary information on a framework agreement, whereas the procurement process is further handled by the agency itself, either by electronic, or traditional means.</p><p>General information on public procurement in Sweden is to be found at the website of the <a href="https://www.upphandlingsmyndigheten.se/en">National Agency for Public Procurement</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, the National Agency for public procurement increased its involvement in eTendering (pre-award) in PEPPOL.
