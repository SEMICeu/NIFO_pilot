The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-328.x-emf" alt="35-328.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Germany in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-369.x-emf" alt="35-369.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Germany’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an imbalanced level of implementation of the EIF Principles. Indeed, for the two Principles that were analysed (Principles 9 and 10) the results show a good implementation, with scores of 4 for both Principles, thus above or at the EU average. Nonetheless, the lack of data for all the other Principles does not allow to have a good overall picture of the level of implementation of the EIF Principles in Germany. </p><p><img src="img/35-379.x-emf" alt="35-379.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The German results for the implementation of interoperability layers are also incomplete due to an absence of data in all the areas of Scoreboard 2. However, Germany has a very good implementation of recommendation relating to integrated public service governance, legal interoperability and organisational interoperability. A potential area of improvement is the implementation of interoperability governance. More specifically, with a low score of 1 in Recommendation 23, Germany should aim at consulting relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines in accordance with its National Interoperability Framework (NIF), when procuring and developing ICT solutions.</p><p><img src="img/35-389.x-emf" alt="35-389.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Germany’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show as well a very incomplete picture. In the area where the recommendations are implemented (Open Data) Germany scores well, at the EU average with a score of 4. However, the absence of data for the rest of the recommendations hinders the analysis of the overall German score on the conceptual model.</p><p>Additional information on Germany’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through interactive dashboards.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p><a id="_Hlk34322211"></a><a id="_Toc34385557"></a>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The Berlin Declaration contains common guidelines on digital transformation in Europe, its impact on society and future opportunities.</p><p>In order to enable value-based digital transformation, the countries that signed the declaration have agreed to carry out concrete measures by 2024 regarding, among other things, the digital sovereignty of their administrations, the promotion of civil society participation, digital inclusion and self-determination. These measures are based on the common values and ethical principles which form the foundation of the European Union and include in particular the following:</p><ol><li>Promoting fundamental rights and democratic values in the digital sphere;</li><li>Enhancing social participation and inclusion;</li><li>Fostering digital empowerment and digital literacy;</li><li>Strengthening trust through security in the digital sphere;</li><li>Strengthening Europe’s digital sovereignty and interoperability;</li><li>Creating value-based, human-centred AI systems for use in the public sector; and</li><li>Fostering resilience and sustainability.</li></ol><p class="subtitle">Federal Digital Strategy </p><p>In February 2022, the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV) kicked off a government-wide coordination process to develop a new Federal Digital Strategy (<em>Digitalstrategie der Bundesregierung</em>). The strategy succeeds the implementation of the Shaping Digitalisation (<em>Digitalisierung gestalten</em>) strategy of the previous administration. It will serve as an overarching umbrella strategy for existing or planned digitalisation strategies of all Federal ministries – for instance the <em>Gigabitstrategie</em> (strategy to speed up the expansion of Germany’s digital infrastructure) – and draw a common thread among them, with the aim of creating synergies and increasing the coherence of Germany’s Federal digital policies.</p><p class="subtitle">Third National Action Plan within the Open Government Partnership</p><p>In the framework of its participation in the Open Government Partnership (OGP), Germany develops national action plans on open government every two years, in accordance with the OGP rules and guidelines. They are the product of a co-creation process between government and civil society resulting in relevant commitments to foster transparency, participation, accountability and other elements of government openness. The German federal government submitted a third National Action Plan (NAP) in the summer of 2021 after a public consultation period lasting from March until June 2021. The new NAP contains eleven commitments by the federal government (including two in cooperation with <em>länder</em> governments) and three individual commitments by two <em>länder</em>, covering such areas as access to legal information, open data, participation in infrastructure planning or open-source software for public administration.</p><p class="subtitle">National eGovernment Strategy </p><p>The National eGovernment Strategy (NEGS), adopted by the Information Technology (IT) Planning Council on 24 September 2010, is regularly evaluated and updated. The goal of the current strategy is to guide the country's eGovernment progress in the coming years. The strategy has been developed in cooperation with a broad spectrum of stakeholders from the fields of administration, politics, science and business. </p><p>The NEGS aims to ensure a common orientation for eGovernment activities and efforts at federal, State and local levels in order to establish an attractive eGovernment and IT approach for citizens and businesses. According to the new vision enshrined in the strategy, eGovernment should be characterised by five principles:</p><ul><li>Usefulness for citizens, businesses and public administration: potential eGovernment users should be fully aware of the services offered to them and be able to access them. In particular, broadband access in rural areas should be improved as well as citizens' digital/media literacy;  </li><li>Cost-effectiveness and efficiency: in order for the public administration to provide rapid, cost-effective and high-quality services, process chains within the public administration should be supported by electronic means and designed following a customer-centric approach. The various processes will be digitalised, with the federal government and the States putting the appropriate legal, organisational and technical instruments in place for ensuring the mandatory use of digital technologies; </li><li>Data protection, cyber security and transparency: data protection, security and transparency constitute important preconditions for the citizens to accept, trust and intensively use eGovernment. Therefore, the NEGS aims at ensuring data transparency and security by paying attention to only collect and process the data that is absolutely necessary for providing a particular administrative service. In addition, the protection of the providing systems is vital for the acceptance of eGovernment services; </li><li>Social participation and transparency: the active participation of citizens and businesses in policy as well as in planning and decision-making processes is fostered, as far as it is reasonable and allowed by law. The impact and the results of the participation should be made transparent to citizens and businesses; and</li><li>Innovation and sustainability: federal, State and local public administrations will support the capacity for innovation and openness to change through their own high-performance and client-oriented eGovernment offerings. </li></ul><p>The NEGS also contains six key principles that new legislation and initiatives should consider: </p><ul><li>Citizens and businesses should be able to carry out as many operations as possible from the same point of access, regardless of time and location; </li><li>Authorities should be able to cooperate quickly across different levels to minimise the administrative burden for citizens, businesses and public administration, e.g. by providing spatial data via the Spatial Data Infrastructure Germany initiative (GDI-DE); </li><li>Citizens and businesses should know which public authorities process their personal data. They should be confident that eGovernment is secure; </li><li>Citizens should be able to use electronic media to participate actively in the policy process and in organising the provision of public services; </li><li>The public administration should use cooperation models with the business and research community when developing and operating eGovernment solutions. This will enable innovative business models, through online services and information; and</li><li>Information security management should lead to a high level of IT security for eGovernment procedures and guarantee data confidentiality, integrity and availability.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Memorandum for the National eGovernment Strategy </p><p>At its fifth meeting on 30 June 2011, the IT Planning Council took the first concrete steps towards the implementation of the National eGovernment Strategy, by publishing a memorandum, which outlines the agreed strategic goals. The focus was placed on building a federal infrastructure and aligning individual measurements. According to the memorandum, IT planning envisages the following priorities to be addressed: </p><ul><li>Transparent government and regulatory actions should be promoted by appropriate measures of IT and eGovernment; </li><li>Federal and State governments need to adapt to the IT processes and current threats from the internet. Therefore, minimum uniform standards for communication between government departments should be developed; </li><li>Develop a common eID strategy to enable citizens and businesses to securely transact with the administration over the internet. In this regard, the notification procedure to the European Commission for the German eID was fully finalised in 2017. As reported by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), “the German eID fulfils all requirement of eIDAS Level of Assurance high”; </li><li>A federal information management system will bring together knowledge management faster and more efficiently to improve public services; </li><li>Sharing initiatives involving federal, State and local governments must be developed to save costs on IT-infrastructure; </li><li>The definition of IT security and IT interoperability standards is one of the main tasks of the IT Planning Board; and</li><li>The framework for levels across eGovernment should be further developed. The IT planning supports the coordinated activities of the federal and State laws to further adjust the regulatory framework. </li></ul><p class="subtitle">IT Consolidation Programme of the German Federal Government </p><p>The German cabinet decided in the summer 2015 to substantially modernise the federal government in the IT department. Consolidating IT at federal level will serve several aims, namely: ensure information security in an increasingly complex IT environment; maintain sovereignty and control over federal IT also in the future; respond swiftly to technological innovations; ensure effective, efficient, stable and future-proof operations; and enable the government to remain an attractive employer for IT experts. Data of the federal administration must be comprehensively protected and secured against misuse. Until 2022, IT consolidation will follow three lines of action: consolidating operations, consolidating services, and centralising procurement. </p><p class="subtitle">IT Strategy of the Federal Administration </p><p>The <a href="https://www.cio.bund.de/Web/DE/Strategische-Themen/IT-Strategie-Bund/it_strategie_bund_node.html">IT Strategy of the Federal Administration</a> (<em>IT-Strategie der Bundesverwaltung</em>) defines ten cross-departmental goals for strategic IT development. With six overarching fields of action, the strategy sets priorities for the further development of IT and thus forms the basis for prioritising existing and future IT measures. To this end, the federal administration's IT strategy takes into account specifications and decisions at European as well as at national level. </p><p class="subtitle">Data Strategy of the German Federal Government </p><p>On 27 January 2021, the German Cabinet adopted the <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-de/suche/data-strategy-of-the-federal-german-government-1950612">Data Strategy of the German Federal Government</a> (<em>Datenstrategie der Bundesregierung</em>). With over 240 measures, the Data Strategy aims to make Germany a trailblazer in the innovative use of data and data sharing in Europe. The German government developed the strategy on the basis of a broad-based participatory process which included an online survey of more than 1,200 respondents. With the help of the Data Strategy measures, the German government intends to enforce European values, the common principles of data protection as well as sovereignty in an age of global data transfers and networking. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle">Once-Only Principle </p><p>A publication of the IT Planning Council on the Once-Only principle (<em>Das Once-Only Prinzip – Potenziale für Bürger, Unternehmen und Verwaltung</em>) from 2017 analysed the situation of eGovernment, with citizens and business having to provide the same pieces of information several times to different public authorities. Besides the description of the current situation, the publication compares the situation in different countries and offers a selection of best practices. In addition, the publication points out four major opportunities the Once-Only principle provides for citizens and the administration in Germany. </p><p>Citizens: </p><ul><li>More transparency: citizens can track in their user accounts which authority has queried their data; </li><li>Quick notices: faster administrative services through interoperable data exchange; </li><li>Proactive eGovernment services: the offer of proactive eGovernment services without time-consuming applications can be increased by reusing citizen´s data; and</li><li>Administrative burden: reduce administrative burden as citizens only have to submit data once. </li></ul><p>Administration<strong>:</strong> </p><ul><li>Efficiency gain: faster and more efficient processing thanks to simplified data exchange; </li><li>Networking: closer exchange of knowledge between administrations through co-creation and collaboration; </li><li>Growth dynamics: a dynamic European single market thanks to lower barriers between States; and </li><li>Validity: valid, forgery-proof, high-qualitydata from an authentic source. </li></ul><p>Finally, the publication highlights that in Germany the eGovernment Law constitutes the legal framework to fully establish the Once-Only principle. </p><p>In March 2021, the IT Planning Council published a roadmap on ‘Modernisation of registers: vision and implementation planning’. The document presents a systematic approach to modernising the German register landscape. This is key to enabling digital services following the Once-Only principle.</p><p class="subtitle">Architectural Guideline for Federal IT </p><p>With the <a href="https://www.cio.bund.de/Web/DE/Architekturen-und-Standards/Architekturrichtlinie-IT-Bund/architekturrichtlinie_it_bund_node.html">Architectural Guideline for Federal IT</a> (<em>Architekturrichtlinie für die IT des Bundes)</em>, adopted in July 2020, the federal government aimed to provide comprehensive IT architecture management in order to achieve IT consolidation in Germany. To do so, binding architecture guidelines, which were subjected to ongoing development, were defined for all areas affected by IT consolidation in the federal government.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Open Data Strategy of the German Federal Government </p><p>On 6 July 2021, the federal cabinet adopted the Open Data Strategy of the German Federal Government.

The laws and regulations at different levels of government have evolved independently. Due to historic reasons, the legal framework of public procurement at the federal level in Germany is embedded both in economic and budgetary law. </p><p>Thus, the complexity of the technological environment is rather high and the baseline for the introduction of modern, user-centred eProcurement systems is really demanding. Due to some more recent EU directives that did impose temporal deadlines for the implementation of eProcurement in EU Member States, the modernisation process started in 2018, when the federal electronic tendering platform was launched successfully. Yet, it will take some more time to achieve the degree of functional integration between the eProcurement systems at all three levels that is necessary to satisfy the needs of all stakeholders involved. </p><p>Already in place is the online procurement platform. The entire procedures for public procurement below EU thresholds will be digitised just like public procurement above the EU thresholds. The website can be used to conduct procurement procedures entirely online. Nothing needs to be sent by post.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle"><em>E-Gesetzgebung</em>: a Project for a Fully Digital Legislation Process </p><p><em>E-Gesetzgebung</em> is a project of the Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community adopted in April 2018, aimed at creating a fully digital legislative process. It will be achieved by making the legislative process at the federal level completely electronic, interoperable, and free of media discontinuity. At the same time, the process orientates itself towards current technological developments, e.g. by providing LegalDocML.de, a data standard for regulatory measures, and user-friendly applications. These applications are integrated into a collaborative platform that enables, for instance, to draw up timetables for regulatory projects or to initiate in-house and interdepartmental votes.

European provisions – in particular the Single Digital Gateway (SDG) Regulation – oblige the German authorities to put the so-called Once-Only principle into practice. The act introduces a unique, trans-sectoral identification number in the German administration in line with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation). The legislation also provides changes in the German fiscal code and other technical items of legislation to enable the processing of the identification number in order to provide administrative services in line with the Online Access Act. The implementation of the legislation is embedded in a roadmap for a modernised register landscape adopted by the federal government and the <em>länder</em>.</p><p>The roadmap presents a systematic approach to modernising the German register landscape. The key component of a modern register landscape is its technical architecture, which should comply with the existing applications and standards of the IT Planning Council. It must be expanded in accordance with the legislative provisions already set out in the German Register Modernisation Act (<em>Registermodernisierungsgesetz, RegMoG</em>) and must guarantee not only implementation of the Once-Only principle (OOP) in Germany, but also a connection to the Once-Only system at European level. Examples of needs-based technical infrastructure expansion might include a central directory of types of evidence and interfaces enabling connectivity between existing registers. The focus of these development efforts should be on strengthening interoperability within Germany and achieving convergence with European technologies.</p><p>Furthermore, the roadmap points out that the technical architecture should not be the only focus of development; the registers themselves should be developed further with a view to ensuring that they meet minimum connectivity and data management requirements. The federal government should both provide technical and methodological backing and create incentives for the necessary work by registration bodies in this area. Academic expertise should also be drawn upon, particularly as regards data quality and the potential of register data. The <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/idnrg/BJNR059110021.html">German Identification Number Act</a> (<em>Identifikationsnummerngesetz</em>, IDNrG) lists 51 registers (out of a total of over 375) that play a key role in implementing the <a href="https://www.onlinezugangsgesetz.de/Webs/OZG/EN/home/home-node.html">German Online Access Act</a> (<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG). Beyond upgrading existing registers, it is also important to examine the opportunities that exist for establishing new registers, in particular a building and housing register and an education register. The research community should be involved at an early stage when planning and implementing register-based census-taking and when scrutinising new registers such as the education register.</p><p class="subtitle">Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services </p><p>On 18 August 2017, the <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ozg/BJNR313800017.html">Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services </a>(<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG) entered into force. The federal, regional and local levels of government are now required to take comprehensive measures in order to promote electronic government services. Core requirements include: </p><ul><li>All (suitable) administrative services must be available online within five years after the law’s entry into force; </li><li>Federal and municipal eGovernment services must be available both through a newly created federal online portal and the online portals of the federal States<em> (Länder)</em>. All portals are meant be connected to a network of portals, the <em>Portalverbund</em>. Thus, access to electronic government services becomes easier and more user-friendly; and</li><li>Access to all administrative services in the portal network must be allowed via a secure single-user account. In the user account, personal data (e.g. date of birth, residence) can be stored permanently for the users’ convenience, provided they have given their consent. </li></ul><p class="subtitle">Act on the Promotion of Electronic Government </p><p>On 17 June 2013, the Bundestag, with the approval of the Bundesrat, adopted the <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/egovg/BJNR274910013.html">Act on the promotion of electronic government </a>(eGovernment Act, EGovG). The German law for the promotion of eGovernment came into effect on 1 August 2013. Its aim was to facilitate electronic communication with the administration and to enable federal, State and local authorities to provide simpler, more user-friendly and efficient eGovernment services. The main provisions include: </p><ul><li>Obligation for federal, State and local authorities to open a point of access for the transfer of electronic documents; </li><li>Obligation for federal authorities to open a De-Mail access and to offer an electronic proof of identity via electronic identity (eID) card and electronic residence permit; </li><li>Electronic record keeping; </li><li>Enabling electronic evidence and electronic payment in administrative procedures; </li><li>Obligation to document and analyse processes before implementing IT systems; </li><li>Provision of machine-readable data (open data); and </li><li>Georeferencing of electronic registers. </li></ul><p>The eGovernment Act triggered legislative activities in most of the German federal States. By now, seven federal States have already adopted their own eGovernment Act, while several others have initiated legislative procedures. </p><p class="subtitle">German Basic Law (Articles 91c and 91d) </p><p>On 1 August 2009, within the framework of the second round of reforms of Germany's federal structure, important changes in the <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/gg/art_91c.html">German Basic Law </a>(<em>Grundgesetz</em>) came into force with articles 91c and 91d. Article 91c ensured the simplification of IT bodies and decision-making processes, thus increasing their effectiveness and enabling their adaptation to the needs of the fast-evolving technical progress. The German federation now has the exclusive legislative competence for the development of a secure linking-up network to interconnect the IT networks of national and federal States, which can prevent any underlying media issues. Furthermore, Article 91d constituted a vital component for administrative modernisation as it provides the legal basis for facilitating the federation and the federal States to directly and effectively benchmark their administrations in order to increase their effectiveness and transparency and provide better public services. </p><p class="subtitle">Law on the Connection of Information Technology Networks of Federal and State Governments </p><p>The envisaged objectives of the German Basic Law are implemented through the connection of IT networks of federal and State governments (IT-NetzG), adopted on 10 August 2009, as well as through an Inter-federal State Agreement, which came into force on 1 April 2010. According to this agreement, the IT Planning Council was established and tasked with developing the technical requirements for the use of the core network infrastructure. Moreover, the IT Planning Council bears the responsibility to steer cross-disciplined eGovernment projects involving both the federation and the federal States. Finally, the Council adopts decisions on IT interoperability and security standards. </p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle">Single Digital Gateway Regulation </p><p>On 11 December 2018, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32018R1724">SDG Regulation 2018/1724 </a>entered into force. Based on a decision of the IT Planning Council, a national stakeholder network for the SDG implementation was set up in April 2019. It consisted of SDG multipliers appointed by each of the 16 federal States, the national coordinator appointed by the federal government, contact persons of the federal ministries and representatives of the leading municipal associations. The network will meet at least twice a year.</p><p>Implementing the requirements for the SDG in Germany is part of the implementation of the Online Access Act (<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG) and takes place within the implementation structures of that Act. The following challenges have already been resolved:</p><ul><li>Linking the Your Europe platform with the Federal Portal, including connecting the EU search engine;</li><li>Linking the Federal Portal with the seven assistance services and, accordingly, with the EU search engine;</li><li>Providing German and English descriptions of federal and State-level services for online and offline procedures; </li><li>Adhering to the Commission’s branding requirements such as the inclusion of the Your Europe logo; and</li><li>Gathering user feedback and collecting user statistics through our national IT components.</li></ul><p>In accordance with Article 14 of the SDG Regulation, the Commission is to provide a technical system for the cross-border application of the Once-Only principle by December 2023. The interconnection of national registers throughout the EU enables the digital exchange among EU Member States of the necessary evidence for the procedures that are to be offered entirely online. </p><p>The German registers, which hold digital evidence for the procedures in question, are to be linked to the Commission’s technical system. The European Commission is currently conducting an evidence survey to determine what evidence is needed for which procedures in Member States. Germany is also conducting such a survey at national level.</p><p>The Commission has not yet adopted the implementing regulation on technical and operational specifications, although the deadline of 12 June 2021 has passed. From Germany’s perspective, connecting the decentralised register landscape of our federal system to a central Commission system is the core challenge.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474963"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474964"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Law on the Reuse of Public Sector Information </p><p>The Directive on open data and the re-use of public sector information (Directive (EU) 2019/1024) entered into force on 16 July 2019. It replaces the Public Sector Information Directive (Directive 2003/98/EC), which was amended by Directive 2013/37/EU. Member States must transpose Directive (EU) 2019/1024 by 16 July 2021. Once fully transposed at national level, it will promote all public sector content that is in principle freely available for re-use, except in very limited cases. It will stimulate the transparency, non-discrimination and non-exclusivity of data. Furthermore, real-time data available via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), open access to publicly funded research data and high value datasets will stimulate innovation and benefit both society and the economy. </p><p class="subtitle">Freedom of Information Act </p><p>After being narrowly approved by the Bundestag in early June 2005, Germany’s <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ifg/BJNR272200005.html">Freedom of Information (FOI) Act </a>was voted on 8 July 2005 by the Bundesrat, published in the Federal Gazette on 13 September 2005 and came into force on 1 January 2006. The law provided the public with a general right to access federal government information. However, this general right was limited by several broadly defined exemptions, covering, for instance, security-sensitive issues, potential threats to public safety and even the “fiscal interests of the federal government”. The legislation also contained an ‘internet clause’ to compel federal administration bodies to make a few items publicly available online. Certain federal States also have their own Freedom of Information Legislation. </p><p class="subtitle">Open Data Act (Article 12a) </p><p>The principle of open data is becoming increasingly important worldwide and the availability of data is becoming an important economic factor. </p><p>Considering this, on 13 July 2017 the legislator initiated an initial amendment to the eGovernment Act (EGovG) and the newly created section 12a of the EGovG (first open data Act). This created for the first time a separate legal framework for open administrative data by establishing common criteria for open data. These include free provision, free access to data and machine readability. At the same time, data protection applies and it must be ensured that such personal data are only provided for publication if the requirements regarding the protection of personal data are met.</p><p>With the second Open Data Act, which entered into force on 23 July 2021 (Act amending the eGovernment Act and introducing a law on the use of public sector data), the legislator refined the existing obligations for the federal administration in various areas under Section 12a of the EGovG and significantly extended the range of authorities obliged to do so. Other key elements are the establishment of open data coordinators in the federal authorities and the inclusion of research data in the obligation to provide them. </p><p>The nation-wide metadata portal GovData was created to ensure that the open data provided by the different administrations can be easily found. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474965"></a>eID and Trust Services </h3><p class="subtitle">Draft Legislation Introducing a Card for EU Citizens and Members of the European Economic Area </p><p>The draft legislation introducing a card for EU citizens and members of the European Economic Area (<em>Gesetz zur Einführung einer Karte für Unionsbürger und Angehörige des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums mit Funktion zum elektronischen Identitätsnachweis sowie zur Änderung des Personalausweisgesetzes und weiterer Vorschriften</em>) was prepared in 2018 and was adopted by the German parliament in June 2019. It introduced the electronic ID card for a larger circle of people. The card is not mandatory and is available upon request for citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area. The eID card is not a classic ID since it has an electronic chip that contains the most important personal information (more specifically, name, date and place of birth, address). </p><p class="subtitle">Brexit Withdrawal Agreement </p><p>The persons covered by the Brexit withdrawal agreement will also be issued an electronic residence permit with integrated eID.</p><p class="subtitle">eIDAS Implementation Act </p><p>Since 1 July 2016, the eIDAS Regulation has been the single legal framework for electronic trust services across the EU.

The core of the eIDAS Implementation Act was the Trust Services Act (VDG). It regulates the national requirements for the effective implementation of the eIDAS Regulation. On 28 February 2019, the Trust Services Ordinance (VDV) came into force, providing the final specifications on the requirements for trust services and trust service providers, such as accessibility and financial security. </p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identification Promotion Act </p><p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&amp;qid=1654624103708">Electronic Identification Promotion Act </a>came into force on 15 July 2017. It aimed to promote the use and dissemination of online identification through the German eID card, making it easier and more secure. The eID card has an electronic proof of identity function and was introduced in 2010. This feature enables citizens, government agencies and businesses to reliably identify themselves on the internet. However, the use of the eID function lagged behind the expectations. In order to address this situation, since 15 July 2017, each new identity card is issued with a ready-to-use electronic identification function. With the Electronic Identification Promotion Act, several other additional measures were taken in order to promote the usage of the national eID function. The responsible data protection authorities monitor compliance with data protection. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital Signature Act </p><p>The German <a href="https://www.bgbl.de/xaver/bgbl/start.xav?start=//*[@attr_id='bgbl117s2310.pdf']#__bgbl__//*[@attr_id='bgbl117s2310.pdf']__1654624216006">Electronic Signature Act </a>came into force on 22 May 2001, implementing EU Directive 1999/93/EC on a Community framework for electronic signatures and replacing the previous Digital Signature Act that was adopted as part of the Information and Communication Services Act of 1 August 1997. It regulated the necessary secure infrastructure for the use of electronic signatures, which received the same legal status as hand-written signatures. It was complemented by an Ordinance on Electronic Signatures of 16 November 2001 setting out standard requirements and responsibilities for certification authorities, as well as minimum requirements for technical components used to create digital signatures. The Digital Signature Act was amended by the Signature Act (1. SigÄndG) of 04/01/2005. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474966"></a>Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle">Federal Data Protection Legislation </p><p>The world's first data protection law was passed in Germany – or, to be more exact, in the federal State Hessen in 1970. In 1977, a Federal Data Protection Law followed, which was replaced in 1990, and amended in 1994 and 1997. An additional revision took place in August 2002 to align German legislation with the EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC).</p><p class="subtitle">Protection of Personal Data</p><p>Due to the EU’s reform of its data protection framework in 2016 – comprising the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679), replacing Directive 95/46/EC, and the Law Enforcement Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680- LED) –Germany revised its data protection laws at federal and <em>länder</em> level. The Federal Data Protection Act, as well as a large number of other federal laws, were adapted on two successive dates.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474967"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle">Commercial Registry </p><p>The most important legislation for the Commercial Registry is the <a href="https://www.bmj.de/SharedDocs/Gesetzgebungsverfahren/DE/Digitalisierungsrichtlinie_Ergaenzung.html;jsessionid=778C24B100F056293336F996583EA884.1_cid324?nn=6704238">German Commercial Code</a>. Part II, Article 8, states that the Commercial Registry is under the control of the courts, and the right to inspect the Registry is open to everyone. Copies of the entries can be obtained upon request and can be authenticated. Another important regulation is the Commercial Registry Regulation. According to article 3, the Commercial Registry addresses two categories: individual merchants and registered joint stock companies. Information regarding the electronic maintenance of the Commercial Registry, recorded files, registry folders and inspections can also be found in the regulation. </p><p class="subtitle">Population Registry </p><p>The Population Registry falls under the <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/administrative-reform/registration/registration.html">Federal Registration Act (BMG).</a> The Act does not provide a definition of the Population Registry, but it regulates areas such as the required reference data to be registered, registration authorities and their duties, storage of data, accuracy and completeness of the Population Registry, information restrictions, storage and deletion of data, registration certificates, use restrictions, automatic retrieval and data transfer. </p><p class="subtitle">Land Registry </p><p>Both the Land Registration Code (<em>Grundbuchordnung,</em> GBO) and the Civil Code (BGB) contain paragraphs which are relevant to the Land Registry. The <em>Grundbuchordnung</em> places more emphasis on governing the procedural part, the required processes and formalities. Its articles cover information such as the entries to be made in the Registry, the rectification of the data, the exchange of copies of the Land Registries, public charges, access to basic files and more. The Civil Code covers such items as land leases, rental fees, annuities and property management. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474968"></a>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">Official Contracting Terms for Award of Service Performance Contracts </p><p>The government transposed Directive 2004/17/EC, Directive 2004/18/EC and Directive 2005/51/EC into national law when the official contracting terms for the award of service performance contracts were published on 6 June 2006. The original contracting terms were subsequently simplified through the Contract Awards for Public Supplies and Services-Part A (VOL/A) published on 29 December 2009 in the Federal Gazette (Volume 61, No. 196a), again with a corresponding correction published on 29 February 2010. The amended Procurement Ordinance (<em>Vergabeverordnung</em>, VgV), which came into force on 11 June 2010, regulated the submission of electronic bids in the area of public procurement. </p><p>On 1 December 2016, the Bundestag adopted the Law on the Transposition of Directive on electronic invoicing in public procurement (Directive 2014/55/EU). </p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing </p><p>In Germany, the competence in the field of eInvocing is shared between the Federal Ministry of the Interior (at the federal level) and the federal States.

Following a decision by the National IT Planning Council in June 2017, XRechnung, the German Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS) based on the European Norm 16931, has become the leading eInvoicing standard for central, regional and local authorities in Germany. Furthermore, the eInvoicing platform ZRE was activated by the federal government for B2G public procurement at the end of 2018 and the eInvoicing platform OZG-RE in fall of 2019 (see chapter 6.5 E-Rechnung). Since November 2019, all government bodies at national level must be able to receive eInvoices from suppliers.

The draft was adopted by the federal cabinet on 13 October 2010 and entered into force on 3 May 2011. De-Mail enables the sending of traceable and confidential documents and messages online. Contrary to conventional e-mails, De-Mails provide proof of delivery. It is not possible to read or manipulate the contents of a De-Mail on its journey across the internet. De-Mail providers are interoperable and provide the same level of security based on an accreditation process that is specified by the legislator. De-Mail providers have to fulfil high requirements concerning security, functions, interoperability and data protection. Furthermore, the De-Mail legislation foresees that providers must not only furnish the stated certificates for security, functionality and interoperability, but must also demonstrate comprehensive measures to protect personal data within the scope of the accreditation procedure. </p><p>The basic specifications for security, functionality and interoperability were drawn up by the federal government together with future De-Mail providers and laid down in technical guidelines. To ensure compliance with these guidelines, De-Mail providers are screened in an accreditation process. De-Mail focuses on data protection and requires, for instance, that De-Mail providers can enable the use of e-mail pseudonyms to prevent communications or consumer profiles traceability. Furthermore, when requested De-Mail providers must store the user’s encryption certificates in the directory to support (additional) end-to-end encryption of De-Mails. </p><p>The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has published the approval criteria on its website. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474971"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI) </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date. </p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Big data </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud computing </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT) </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance computing </h3><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity </h3><p class="subtitle">Revised Telecommunications Act</p><p>The revised Telecommunications Act (TKG) entered into force in December 2021.

With it, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) want to support and accelerate the breakthrough of highly innovative ideas into the market. The agency's primary goal is to discover and further develop research ideas that have the potential to become leap innovations. Among these projects to be funded in the future is the establishment of new subsidiaries, which in turn create new ventures, and thus jobs, in Germany.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474981"></a>Subnational (federal, regional and local)</h2><p class="subtitle">German Federal States </p><p>All of the federal States (<em>länder</em>) are currently setting their own eGovernment strategies. As a result of these strategies, nearly all local authorities have an Internet presence and over 80% of local authorities are already providing relevant online services. Furthermore, a large number of local authorities in Germany offer central access to their online services via highly efficient portals.

The number of public administrative procedures in Germany that can be completed online has therefore been significantly increased. These eGovernment services became easier and faster to find on the web - as users no longer need to know which federal jurisdiction is responsible for the respective procedure. </p><p>To achieve this aim, the German federal, state and local governments worked on a <a href="https://www.onlinezugangsgesetz.de/Webs/OZG/DE/umsetzung/ozg-infrastruktur/portalverbund/portalverbund-node.html">common strategy</a>. This strategy entails a joint network of the administrative portals, one at the federal level and one for each state. The portals are structured according to life and business situations. Municipal portals and services are connected to the portal network via state portals. To allow for simple and secure processing of eGovernment services, users are provided with service accounts, similar to customer accounts in e-commerce, which also feature post box functions. In order to save time and costs, the portal network builds on existing solutions. </p><p>The Federal Portal offers central and convenient access to administrative services in Germany and has been made available to the public in a fully revised version since December 2020. In order to use the full functionality of the Federal Portal it can be accessed best via the Federal User Account. This Federal User Account complies with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC - in short, eIDAS Regulation. Federal ministries and government agencies using this account automatically comply with EU requirements that came into force in September 2018. As part of the portal network, the Federal Portal also offers access to information, procedures and services within the jurisdiction of the federal States and municipalities. The legal basis for the entire project is the so-called Online Access Act (<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em>, OZG) which came into force in August 2017. </p><p>The digitalisation initiative is supported by the digitalisation programme of the IT Planning Council. Within this programme, selected administrative procedures with high relevance for citizens and companies were digitalised. These procedures were made available online nationwide via the portal network. </p><p>The digitalisation of public administration in Germany is constantly supported by FIM (Federal Information Management). By offering textual information, form fields and processes, FIM lays the foundation for a uniform and unambiguous description and structuring of public tasks and duties both for the enforcement level and for the legislation. Furthermore, FIM provides the conditions for a simplified electronic mapping of cross-organisational administrative processes in the form of IT-based procedures. The three building blocks (services, data fields and processes) as well as the overall coordination are jointly operated by the German federal government and the State governments. The FIM portal has been online since September 2018 (fimportal.de). </p><p class="subtitle">GovData Portal </p><p>The German data portal GovData provides a unified, centralised access to administrative data from federal, State and local governments. The goal is to make this data accessible in one single place and thus easier to use for both citizens and businesses. In the spirit of the Open Data principle, the portal aims to promote the use of open licenses and increase the supply of machine-readable raw data. </p><h3>Subnational Portals </h3><p class="subtitle"><em>Portalverbund</em> </p><p>At the moment subnational and regional portals run independently. Following the concept of the federal State portals, the local portals will be intelligently connected with the federal structures. The portal network <a href="https://www.fitko.de/produktmanagement/pvog"><em>Portalverbund</em> </a>is part of the implementation of the German Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administrative Services and main element of the infrastructure of the Online Access Act. Currently the development of the portal network is in its final stage. Nearly each of the State portals including their basis IT components is already part of the network. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474990"></a>Networks </h2><p class="subtitle">Federal Networks </p><p>The <a href="https://www.cio.bund.de/Web/DE/Strategische-Themen/Moderne-Verwaltungskommunikation/moderne_verwaltungskommunikation_node.html">Federal Networks </a>(<em>Netze des Bundes,</em> NdB) replace the Berlin-Bonn Information Network (IVBB) and the Information Network of the Federal Administration (IVBV) and increase the efficiency and security (in terms of availability and privacy) of the networks involved. The aim is to create a common infrastructure for the federal government in the long term. NdB provides the main federal authorities with central internet access and networking services. In 2006, the Federal Intranet (<em>Intranet des Bundes</em>) was introduced. The intranet portal features services and workflows, such as a search engine, a travel management system and access to information and document databases for people and federal agencies. NdB is a private IP-based communication network, which serves as intranet among the different public administration departments. </p><p>The importance of network infrastructures has changed over the last 20 years. Today network infrastructures are essential for the modern administration. Nearly every public authority needs special IT procedures to perform its tasks. </p><p>Due to the increased threat level by highly developed malware (e.g. Trojan software), NdB fulfils the highest connection security requirements at federal and State level. Therefore, NdB provides firewall systems, comprehensive encryption of the data communication and permanent observation of the connected users and the established connections. </p><p>The sponsor for NdB is the <em>Beauftragte für Informationstechnik der Bundesregierung</em> (BfIT). The BDBOS is responsible for the operation of NdB. </p><p class="subtitle"><em>Verbindungsnetz</em> (VN)</p><p>Based on the former Deutschland Online Infrastructure the <em>Verbindungsnetz</em> (VN) was established. The usage for federal communication is part of the German constitution (GG §91c) and therefor mandatory for the German public administration. The VN establish the network infrastructure for widespread and integrated electronic processing between federal administrative units. The VN network is as a connective network structure (coupling network) for the public administration networks in Germany, with junctions to the sTESTA network of the European Union and to the federal networks NdB. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange </h2><p class="subtitle">De-Mail </p><p>De-Mail is an easy-to-use technology that takes conventional e-mail one step further as it allows citizens, businesses and administrations to exchange electronic messages in a secure manner. Compared to conventional e-mails, the delivery of De-Mails and the identity of senders and recipients can be proven. It is not possible to read or manipulate the contents of a De-Mail on its journey across the internet. One important aim is to make De-Mail confidential, reliable and binding through basic security functions that are easy to use and do not require additional installations for the end-user. The sender and recipient of a De-Mail can be clearly identified. Send and delivery certificates can be easily generated.</p><p>De-Mails are encrypted during transport and can neither be intercepted nor manipulated. Spam and phishing are effectively prevented because the De-Mail sender can be clearly identified by secure initial identification and users are able to log on with two-factor authentication using the new German eID card or a mobile phone-based method (mobile TAN). </p><p>Furthermore, De-Mail offers huge potential to optimise electronic communications in the private and public sector. Recently, business and administration processes were marked by media inconsistencies that produced considerable delays and additional costs. With the additional security functions that De-Mail provides, a large part of today’s paper-based business and administration processes can now be handled fully electronically, simply, quickly and from any location. </p><p>The legal requirements for registration as De-Mail provider are contained in the Act on De-Mail services and amendments to other legislation, which entered into force on 3 May 2011. So far, inter alia Deutsche Telekom AG, GMX.DE, WEB.DE and Mentana GmbH have become accredited De-Mail providers. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services </h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identity Card </p><p>Germany's next generation Identity Card (eID) was launched on 1 November 2010. The new eID card in credit card format replaced the existing national identity card and offers more functions than the current conventional ID. By utilising a microchip, the card provides an online authentication function, applicable to both eGovernment and eBusiness transactions. Due to the assignment of authorisation certificates and mutual authentication, cardholders can be confident that whoever requests their data is also authorised to obtain it. The secure eID card provides further protection against identity theft and offers new, user-friendly ways to guarantee valid client data for service providers and to protect young people by age verification. Furthermore, the eID card can be used as identification and authentication means for remote signatures. To ensure that national ID cards continue to serve as secure travel documents, eID cards contain biometric identifiers stored on a chip, which satisfies the requirements for official identity checks. All eID cards include a digital biometric photo; cardholders could choose to include two fingerprints on the chip as well. Both identifiers provide an efficient way to increase security at border controls. </p><p>In February 2017, Germany was the first Member State to trigger the <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/Webs/PA/EN/government/eIDAS_Regulation/eID_function_EU-wide/eu-wide-use-of-the-german-eid-function-node.html">pre-notification procedure </a>to make sure that EU citizens and businesses could use their trusted electronic identification means (eID), as provided under eIDAS, to digitally authenticate themselves in order to use online services across the European Union. elD cards shall guarantee a high level of security and protection of personal data. The notification procedure for the German eID was completed in 2017 at a high level of assurance. </p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Passport (ePass) </p><p>Germany was among the first countries to introduce the Electronic Passport (ePass), in November 2005. It was developed to comply with Council Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 and equipped with a microchip, holding the owner’s data, such as name, surname, date of birth and nationality. Beyond traditionally relevant data, a digital facial image of the owner was also stored on the microchip. In June 2007, the revision of the Passport Act, as approved by the federal council, laid down the legal foundation for second generation electronic passports. In addition to the digital facial image, the new passports featured two fingerprints in digital format. Fingerprints were to be stored exclusively on the passport microchip, and never stored locally on issuance authorities’ systems, or in any other central database. </p><p>In March 2017, Germany issued a new generation of passports. For the new passport, traditional high-quality security features were complemented by additional, innovative features combining state-of-the-art materials with cutting-edge technology. </p><p class="subtitle">Signature Alliance </p><p>Administration and private partners founded the Signatures Alliance in 2003. The cooperation aims at promoting the usage of electronic signatures in Germany and delivering their benefits to both public and private service providers. All citizens should be able to use a standardised technical infrastructure, to access interoperable applications in the areas of eBusiness and eGovernment, using their diverse signature cards. More information and details may be found in the document ‘<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Guidance+documents">Requiremens and convergent objectives of the Signature Alliance</a>’ (<em>Vorgaben und Konvergenzziele für das Signaturbündnis</em>). </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement </h2><p class="subtitle">Federal eProcurement Platform (eVergabe) </p><p>The <a href="https://www.evergabe-online.de/start.html?4">eVergabe </a>project was considered to be one of the most important projects of the BundOnline 2005 initiative. The service features the electronic awarding of orders based on communications between the awarding agency and potential bidders that are comprehensive, legally binding and free from media discontinuities. The offering ranges from notification via electronic tender submission to contract award using the contract award platform. The documents containing the contract terms can be downloaded and bids can be submitted with an electronic signature. The eAward project falls within the remit of the Procurement Agency of the Federal Ministry of the </p><p>Interior (BMI; responsible authority: “Beschaffungsamt des BMI”, www.bescha.bund.de). In technical terms, the service was implemented as a web-based information and transactional platform using Java clients and combined with a web interface to search for tenders. In addition to the eVergabe platform, all public tenders from this platform are automatically and continuously published online on <a href="http://www.service.bund.de">www.service.bund.de</a> (sector “Ausschreibungen”). </p><p>Presumably starting in harvest 2022 a new information service (“Bekanntmachungsservice”, BKMS) will be added to the “e-Vergabe platform” that makes it much easier for companies (as possible tenderers) to find relevant public invitations to tender published by awarding authorities from all three governmental levels (federal, states and local government level). </p><p class="subtitle">Federal eGovernment Shop </p><p>The <a href="http://www.kdb.bund.de/KdB/DE/Startseite/home_node.html">Federal eProcurement Platform</a>, the Procurement Agency of the Federal Ministry of the Interior also developed the Federal eGovernment shop (<em>Kaufhaus des Bundes</em>, KdB). With this solution, ordering materials takes place through an electronic catalogue. Supplies of printing paper, for instance, are ordered with a few clicks. Even customised PCs and cars can be ordered online directly from the company. Conservative calculations estimate that each electronically executed order via KdB saves at least 377 minutes (which equals EUR 195 of personnel expenses) compared to the simplest form of single tender action. </p><p class="subtitle">eRechnung </p><p>The eInvoicing service of the federal government was completed on 27 November 2019. Federal government bodies now receive and process electronic invoices via eInvoicing platforms (<em>Zentrale Rechnungseingangsplattform des Bundes, ZRE and Onlinezugangsgesetzkonforme Rechnungseingangsplattform, OZG-RE</em>). Since 27 November 2020, suppliers of federal government authorities and agencies have to submit electronic invoices for public contracts. The regulations of the German federal States may show some differences. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment </h2><p class="subtitle">ePayBL </p><p>ePayBL (<em>ePayment des Bundes und der Länder</em>) was established as a mandatory basic IT component at the federal government level. ePayBL is a software component developed by a joint community of federal (<em>bund</em>) and State (<em>länder</em>) administration.

So far, the Broadband Atlas, operated by the MIG since December 2021, and the Infrastructure Atlas (ISA), have been run by the Federal Network Agency since 2009. Its information on facilities and physical infrastructures suitable for telecommunication purposes are only accessible for specific usage conditions. Besides, the MIG has been responsible so far for surveying the mobile network forecast, after which the mobile network operators are questioned about their planned network expansion activities for the following 12 months. This query is also used for a better coordination between the public funding programme and private-sector activities.</p><p>In the next step, the Federal Network Agency will be responsible for developing a comprehensive GIS portal, which - in addition to providing information on broadband and mobile coverage, infrastructures, and construction sites - will also provide information on the planned mobile network deployment as well as on public properties. Thus, data delivery as well as usage conditions can be managed efficiently and uniformly on federal level. The Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport, network operators, municipalities, and other public authorities will have access to an advanced database for infrastructure planning and coverage analysis. </p><p><img src="img/35-781.jpeg" alt="A picture containing text, computer, person, indoor

Your Europe is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad. In order to do so, Your Europe offers information on basic rights under EU law, but also on how these rights are implemented in each individual country (where information has been provided by the national authorities). Free email or telephone contact with EU assistance services, to get more personalised or detailed help and advice is also available.</p><p>Please note that, in most cases, the EU rights described in Your Europe apply to all EU member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and sometimes to Switzerland. Information on Your Europe is provided by the relevant departments of the European Commission and complemented by content provided by the authorities of every country it covers. As the website consists of two sections - one for citizens and one for businesses, both managed by DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) - below the main groups of services for each section are listed.</p><h2>Life and Travel</h2><p>For citizens, the following groups of services can be found on the website:</p><ul><li>Travel (e.g. Documents needed for travelling in Europe); </li><li>Work and retirement (e.g. Unemployment and Benefits);</li><li>Vehicles (e.g. Registration);</li><li>Residence formalities (e.g. Elections abroad);</li><li>Education and youth (e.g. Researchers);</li><li>Health (e.g. Medical Treatment abroad);</li><li>Family (e.g. Couples);</li><li>Consumers (e.g. Shopping).</li></ul><h2>Doing Business</h2><p>Regarding businesses, the groups of services on the website concern:</p><ul><li>Running a business (e.g. Developing a business);</li><li>Taxation (e.g. Business tax);</li><li>Selling in the EU (e.g. Public contracts); </li><li>Human Resources (e.g. Employment contracts);</li><li>Product requirements (e.g. Standards);</li><li>Financing and Funding (e.g. Accounting);</li><li>Dealing with Customers (e.g. Data protection).</li></ul><p>The Digital Public Administration Factsheets</p><p>The factsheets present an overview of the state and progress of Digital Public Administration and Interoperability within European countries.</p><p>The factsheets are published on the Joinup platform, which is a joint initiative by the Directorate General for Informatics (DG DIGIT) and the Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content &amp; Technology (DG CONNECT). This factsheet received valuable contribution from Lara Wiengarten and Fabian Wagener, Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community.</p><p><img src="img/35-877.png" alt="W + WAVESTONE–RGB" /><em>          The Digital Public Administration factsheets are prepared for the European Commission by Wavestone.</em></p><p>An action supported by Interoperable Europe </p><p>The ISA² Programme has evolved into Interoperable Europe - the initiative of the European Commission for a reinforced interoperability policy.  </p><p>The work of the European Commission and its partners in public administrations across Europe to enhance interoperability continues at full speed despite the end of the ISA<sup>2</sup> programme. Indeed, enhanced interoperability will be necessary to unlock the potential of data use and reuse for improved public services, to enable cross-border collaboration, and to support the sector-specific policy goals set by the Commission for the future.</p><p>Interoperable Europe will lead the process of achieving these goals and creating a reinforced interoperability policy that will work for everyone. The initiative is supported by the Digital Europe Programme.</p><p><img src="img/35-880.jpeg" alt="Graphical user interface, application
