The most important goal will be to achieve an increase in the average household income to 76-80% of the EU average by 2020, an approximation to the EU average by 2030, while reducing income disparities between individual regions. The percentage of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion is expected to decrease to 20% in 2020 (and 17% in 2030). One objective is to increase Poland's GDP per capita levels to 75-78% of the EU average by 2020 (and to 95% in 2030).</p><p>Ensuring a high and stable growth rate will be facilitated by the implementation of the following measures:</p><p>Total investment to grow to account for 25% of GDP;</p><p>Increase in the share of R&amp;D expenditures to 1.7% of GDP;</p><p>Average annual growth rate of exports of 7.2%;</p><p>10% share of advanced technology products in total exports. </p><p>Among the main objectives still to be implemented include eGovernment measures, particularly those involving the effective use of information and communication technologies in public administration. </p><p>The concept of eGovernment and digital public services imply that high-quality services for citizens, including entrepreneurs, are to be provided by modern IT solutions supporting a logical and coherent government IT system, developed and maintained with the cooperation of all actors at various levels of public administration.</p><p>A priority task in the field of eGovernment is to allow the widest possible range of public services to be provided digitally, thereby enabling citizens to handle their business remotely. It will be necessary to ensure the interoperability of public IT systems and to computerise the internal processes of the administration.</p><p>This strategy assumes activities for:</p><p>Providing eServices relevant to real needs, as reported by citizens and entrepreneurs;</p><p>Creating a single information and eServices website for the government administration so as to improve access for citizens and entrepreneurs;</p><p>Introducing a uniform and secure system for identifying citizens (eID) in eServices systems of public administration;</p><p>Ensuring a dominant share of digital document flow in administration and economic trade;</p><p>Increasing access to public sector information, including through interfaces for software developers;</p><p>Adopting a standard for digital documentation management systems in public administration, guaranteeing an efficient exchange of information with the public administration’s domain-specific systems;</p><p>Integrating eGovernment data processing infrastructure and the development of a state register system. Ensuring the necessary reliability and availability of eGovernment systems and their integration. </p><p>It is worth mentioning that there are other elements linking this Strategy to the EC’s Digital Single Market Strategy, whose implementation is governed and monitored be the Ministry of Digital Affairs.</p><p class="subtitle">Operational Programme Digital Poland 2014-2020 </p><p>The aim of the <a href="https://www.funduszeeuropejskie.gov.pl/media/1655/POPC_eng_1632015.pdf">Operational Programme Digital Poland 2014-2020</a> was to strengthen the foundations for the development of a digital country, including broad access to high-speed Internet, efficient and user-friendly public eServices and the ever-increasing level of digital literacy in society. This programme was recognition that Poland remained significantly behind other Member States in the use of the developmental potential of ICT.</p><p>In particular, the Council took note of:</p><p>Low fixed broadband coverage;</p><p>Relatively low efficiency of public administration;</p><p>Relatively low level of use of eGovernment;</p><p>Very low percentage of adults who engage in learning throughout life.</p><p>The report recommended the development of broadband networks and improvement in the quality and efficiency of public services through digitisation. The method of implementing eServices will include mechanisms to prevent the phenomenon of 'digitisation bureaucracy', forcing the positive impact of projects on administrative processes, and to train as many people as possible in the use of ICT to improve the quality of their life, social life and increase the competitiveness of the labour market.</p><p class="subtitle">National Integrated Informatisation Programme 2020 (PZIP) </p><p>The <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/news/pl-national-integrated-i">National Integrated Informatisation Programme 2020</a> (PZIP) was adopted in September 2016. This strategic document defined Government action aimed at developing the public administration using modern digital technologies and, as a result, improving the functioning of the State, while creating conditions that facilitated citizens’ communications with public administration, and the use of information resources and shared solutions for their needs.</p><p>The evaluation of the currently valid programme carried out in 2018, and the changes taking place in its environment, indicated the need to adopt new assumptions to respond to current problems and challenges in the process of the State’s digital transformation. The objectives of the Programme were thus redefined. The objective was to modernise public administration with the use of digital technologies corresponding to the need to improve the efficiency of the state and improve the quality of administration relations with citizens and other stakeholders. Reform of the Programme is currently under way.</p><p class="subtitle">State Information Architecture</p><p>The State Information Architecture was created in 2018. The Ministry of Digital Affairs, in cooperation with other institutions, created the State Information Architecture, whose task was to organise the IT systems and adopt a method of managing their development in accordance with the guidelines of the National Integrated Informatisation Programme.</p><p>The State Information Architecture contained principals, standards, models and management processes, as well as elements necessary to realise the digital vision of the state covering legal, organisational, semantic and technical layers.</p><p>The developed concept allowed for an agile approach to the process of organising and expanding the architecture of the State's information systems.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">The Open Data Programme (2016)</p><p>The Ministry, having adopted the necessary legislative changes, also drafted a strategic document.

This was the first governmental document dedicated to opening public data. Previous actions lacked a cohesive, horizontal vision for opening access to data. The Programme’s preparation was preceded by the study of the needs of shareholders who used data for a variety of purposes: commercial, scientific, research, etc.</p><p>The main aim of the document was to improve the quality and quantity of available data via a single <a href="https://danepubliczne.gov.pl/en/">website</a>. It emphasised transparency in public administration and the facilitation of citizens’ participation in governance, analysis and public data re-use. In the course of 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of information resources accessible in the Central Repository of Public Information, and consequently an improvement in the re-use of public sector information throughout Poland.</p><p class="subtitle">Open Data Standards</p><p>In 2018, the Polish Ministry of Digital Affairs published <a href="https://dane.gov.pl/knowledge-base/education/1220">guidelines</a> to prepare and share data for re-use. The guidelines concerned the Application Programming Interface (API) Standard; Security Standard; Technical Standard; and Legal Standard. In 2018, the Polish Ministry of Digital Affaires elaborated to ensure a higher quality of data was provided by the public administration. Open data may now be reused for research or business purposes. Opening public data makes the activities of public administration more transparent and allows civic control over these activities. Personal data protection and legal or technical considerations should not prevent data opening. Public open data standards for the administration were developed as part of the project: "Open data – access, standard, education.” This motto highlighted the need for proper preparation and sharing of data for the reuse. It included guidelines on legal regulation, ensuring data security and privacy protection, technical aspects of data sharing and access to databases through APIs (Application Programming Interface).</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>Security aspects related to digital government</h3><p class="subtitle">Strengthening of cybersecurity </p><p>In the course of 2018, Poland created a solid base for strengthening cybersecurity within the country.

The purpose of this project was to allow Polish citizens, companies and other entities to identify themselves online in order to access the public administration’s electronic services. This target will be achieved through the integration of different, currently functioning eID systems to create a single, standardised access point to eID services. Moreover, the Polish eIDAS Node will be linked to the national eID nodes of the other EU Member States.</p><p>Since March 2017, a few new eServices concerning eID have been introduced in Poland, as listed below:</p><ul><li>The Ministry of Digital Affairs launched <a href="https://obywatel.gov.pl/dokumenty-i-dane-osobowe/mdokumenty-potwierdzaj-tozsamosc-smartfonem">mDocuments</a> - a pilot version of a service enabling citizens to confirm their identity (or rights, e.g.: for driving a car) through a mobile device (mobile phone or smartphone), instead of paper documents;</li><li>The so-called Trusted Profile, an eIdentification method ensured by the public administration, was integrated with the seven biggest banks operating in Poland;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/cyfryzacja/nowa-koncepcja-wdrozenia-polskiego-dowodu-osobistego-z-warstwa-elektroniczna">e-ID project</a> (former <a href="http://plid.obywatel.gov.pl/about">pl.ID project</a>) was initiated.

The implemented eID card included an integrated electronic layer which contained the same data as those available at the graphic layer. The electronic layer included 3 certificates: presence confirmation (only tap needed), identification and authorisation (4 number PIN needed) and personal signature authorisation (6 number PIN needed). Furthermore, an additional space for qualified certificate of personal signature was provided.

The Act on the NCSS was not only a simple transposition of the NIS Directive. The Act combined eight supplementary secondary legislation regulations, inter alia: an ordinance of the Council of Ministers on thresholds for considering an incident as significant, an ordinance of the Council of Ministers on the list of essential services and thresholds of significance of the disruptive effect of an incident on the provision of essential services, an ordinance of the Minister of Digital Affairs regarding organisational and technical conditions for entities providing services in the field of cyber security as well as technical conditions for internal structures responsible for cybersecurity within essential service providers, and set out a comprehensive National Cyber Security System. The Government decided to maintain and develop its decentralised approach towards a governance structure of its cybersecurity system. There was a clear division of responsibilities and capabilities between all engaged institutions established pursuant to the Act. The Act allowed the creation of an efficient, comprehensive system that allowed stakeholders to detect, prevent, and mitigate the impact of incidents that affected Polish national interests, while helping crucial societal and economic activities.  </p><p>The Act created a coherent incident response system based on the leading role of three Computer Security Incident Response Teams at the national level (CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK and CSIRT GOV) with a certain and clear division of constituencies. </p><p>The Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity, responsible for coordination of activities and implementation of the government policy in the field of providing cyber security, as well as the Advisory Committee operating at the Council of Ministers, in the capacity of a consultative and advisory body in matters of cyber security and relevant activities of CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK, CSIRT GOV, sectoral cyber security teams and the competent authorities for cyber security, were set up.</p><p class="subtitle">National Cybersecurity Framework Act</p><p>This entity works on new national legislation in the field of cybersecurity.

The Ministry of Digital Affairs has prepared a draft of a national act on personal data protection, which is now being publicly consulted with interested parties (other governmental bodies). The process of making the Polish legal system fully compliant with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) GDPR was two-fold when it   took effect on 25 May 2018 replacing the 1997 Act on the Protection of Personal Data.</p><p>The purpose of the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20180001000">Act</a> was to ensure the application of the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, it was necessary to continue activities in the scope of full harmonisation of the national legal order in connection with the effective date of the GDPR. The law enforcement package of the GDPR enforced amendments to over 162 Polish acts, ensuring national laws complied with the GDPR. On 21 February 2019, Parliament adopted a package, <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20180001000">an act amending certain acts</a> in connection with ensuring the application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament, and of the Council of 27 April 2016, on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and the repeal of Directive 95/46/EC.

From November 2018, all public administrations began accepting (structured) electronic invoices. After two years, this obligation as imposed on all entrepreneurs participating in public procurement. The long-term goal, however, was to consult with stakeholders to change national and EU VAT rules, in order to receive electronic invoices as a default mode in the B2B and B2C relations.</p><p class="subtitle">Public Procurement Law</p><p>The <a href="https://www.uzp.gov.pl/en">Law on Public Procurement</a> entered into force in March 2004. It enabled the development of eProcurement systems for Polish public administrations, the use of advanced electronic signatures in the submission of tenders, and the use of electronic auctions for certain contracts. In April 2006, the Public Procurement Law was largely amended in order to implement the provisions of the EU Directives on public procurement (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0017:EN:HTML">2004/17/EC</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0018:EN:HTML">2004/18/EC</a>), including those pertaining to electronic auctions and the Dynamic Purchasing System. This amended version placed electronic communications between the awarding entity and the economic operator on the same level as that of written or fax communications, regardless of the procurement procedure in question. It furthermore defined cases when transferred data must be supplied with a qualified electronic signature. In 2017 the Public Procurement Law was amended again to include changes introduced by the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20160001579">Act of 5 September 2016 on Trust Services and Electronic Identification</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Act on Electronic Invoicing in Public Procurement Concessions for Construction Works or Services and Public-Private Partnership</p><p>Public institutions must be prepared to receive invoices in the form of electronic documents with prescribed structures.

It allows public administration offices to provide services without charging.</p><p>Through the platform, official matters can be arranged over the Internet without having to fill in the same information repeatedly, hence ensuring a convenient form of contact with public administration and vice versa.</p><p>The ePUAP system was developed in stages. The 'Development of the ePUAP Electronic Platform of Public Administration Services' was carried out between January 2006 and October 2008 under the auspices of the 2004-2006 Sector Operational Programme - Improvement of the Competitiveness of Enterprises, Priority 1: 'Enhancement of a knowledge-based economy business environment', Measure 1.5: 'Development of a system for entrepreneurs’ access to information and public services online'. </p><p>The Centre of Digital Administration (CCA) is currently working on the ePUAP2 project. It will expand the functionality of the ePUAP platform and increase the number of public services available online. This project is co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund under the 2007-2013 Innovative Economy Operational Programme, Priority 7: 'Information society - Establishment of electronic administration'.</p><p class="subtitle">Obywatel.gov.pl</p><p>In 2015, the portal <a href="https://obywatel.gov.pl/">obywatel.gov.pl</a> was created.

As a result, a new kind of civil proceeding was incorporated into the Polish Code of Civil Procedure. The aim was to increase the efficiency of the procedure and improve the quality of service to parties in court proceedings. The claimant states the evidence to support their claims but without attaching them to the statement of claim.</p><p class="subtitle">Government Centre for Legislation</p><p>Since April 2011, various Polish legal acts have been transmitted to the <a href="https://www.rcl.gov.pl/">Government Centre for Legislation</a> in electronic form only, using the eGovernment portal electronic Platform of Public Administration Services. As a result, the electronic version of the legislation, which previously was merely complementary to the original paper version, can be validated if it bears a digital signature.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474990"></a>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle">STAP</p><p>STAP, a Secure Network for Public Administration, is a nationwide network linking Central Government departments, offices, agencies and Local Government. Its primary goals are to integrate existing public networks in order to minimise maintenance and service costs (phone, Internet access and data transmission); to increase security; to enable the interoperability of applications; and to provide a communication infrastructure for the Electronic Platform of Public Administration Services (ePUAP). STAP is an acronym for a number of different sectoral networks.</p><p class="subtitle">SIPR</p><p>This ICT system built within the framework of the SIPR Project made it possible to introduce the electronic communication of emergency call operators (the 112 number) with emergency service operators, which significantly improved the existing contacts and shortened the time of handling calls. Operability and work efficiency increased thanks to the introduction of standardisation of procedures, a uniform training programme and a tool software.</p><p class="subtitle">National Education Network</p><p>The National Educational Network is a project to provide high-speed internet connections (at least 100 Mb/s) for all schools and make more e-resources available to teachers.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">mCitizen</p><p>mCitizen is a public mobile application for Polish citizens launched on Android and iOS platform. It is designed as a container for mobile documents. Currently, it has implemented mobile ID based on national citizens registries and mobile school ID.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">The Trusted Profile</p><p>The Trusted Profile is a solution that can be used to submit a free online signature in a public service, but also as a means of electronic identification using two authentication factors. </p><p class="subtitle">ID Card with Electronic Layer</p><p>The ID card is a secure tool for electronic communication with the administration, health service and commercial entities through the implementation of an electronic identity card. The data contained in the electronic layer of the ID card allows its holder to use online services and confirm their presence in a particular place and time. It is equipped with an advanced electronic signature and may contain qualified electronic signature from chosen (by the holder) trust service provider. Moreover, ICAO application is also implemented in the identity card.</p><p class="subtitle">National Electronic Identification Node</p><p>The <a href="https://login.gov.pl/login/main">National Electronic Identification Node</a> provides convenient access to public portals and e-services provided by the administration. It is an organisational and technical solution that integrates IT systems at a single point in which public online services are made available, with various electronic identification systems used to confirm the identity of users of online services. According to the decision to introduce a federated electronic identification scheme in Poland, this can be issued by both public and private entities.</p><p class="subtitle">Commercial CAs Certificates</p><p>Qualified and unqualified certification authorities (CAs) issue electronic identifiers to individual persons. These identifiers are usually Integrated Circuit Cards (ICC) with crypto-controller, private cryptographic keys and public key certificates installed inside or software-based tokens. In the case of eGovernment systems and applications, the most frequently used identifiers are ones with qualified public key certificates. Electronic signatures with unqualified certificates are used rarely, and their usage is mainly limited to message authentication, authentication of servers, workstations and other IT equipment.</p><p class="subtitle">Commercial eSignatures</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nccert.pl/">National Certification Centre</a> performs the role of the root certification authority for the infrastructure of secure electronic signatures in Poland, entrusted to the National Bank of Poland by the Minister of Economy pursuant to the Act of 18 September 2001 on the electronic signature. Currently, in Poland there are five qualified certification service providers. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Procurement platforms: Public Procurement Office portal</p><p>The Public Procurement Office of Poland plays a central role in policy-making and coordination of the entire domestic public procurement system. The launch of the Public Procurement Office portal (‘PPO portal’) managed by the Public Procurement Office has been essential for the functioning of public procurement in Poland. The PPO portal contains information and tools aimed at developing the eProcurement system.</p><p class="subtitle">Information on Polish Public Procurement System</p><p>The current public procurement system of Poland is based on the Act of Public Procurement Law (PPL) adopted on 29 January 2004, with further amendments. The responsible body for such matters is the President of the Public Procurement Office, assisted in his/her work by the <a href="https://www.uzp.gov.pl/">Public Procurement Office</a>. Entities obliged to follow PPL include different types of the public finance sector units. They are obliged to award contracts according to the rules of fair competition and equal treatment of economic operators, impartiality and objectivity of persons preparing and conduction procedures specified in the act of the Public Procurement Law.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474994"></a>eInvoicing</h2><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing Infrastructure</p><p>eInvoicing in Poland is the responsibility of the Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Technology and Institute of Logistics and Warehousing. Poland is continuing with implementation of the eInvoicing Directive and building a platform (PEF) for eInvoicing to process and exchange eInvoices. Once it is operational, it is expected to be the main eInvoicing platform used by public entities and economic operators for B2G eInvoicing in public procurement.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Court Payments</p><p>The <a href="http://www.zgierz.sr.gov.pl/e-platnosci-nowy-system-elektronicznych-oplat-sadowych,new,mg,1.html,79">Electronic Court Payments</a> is a system that allows users to pay court fees electronically.

The portal provides information about currently accessible eAdministration services, along with their relative usage statistics.</p><p class="subtitle">Public Information Bulletin</p><p>The <a href="http://www.bip.gov.pl/">Public Information Bulletin</a> (<em>Biuletyn Informacji Publicznej – BIP</em>) is the official electronic journal providing access to public information. Information is distributed through a system of web information pages of central and local administration authorities, designed in a uniform layout and with common content guidelines.</p><p class="subtitle">The Integrated Analytical Platform </p><p>The Integrated Analytics Platform (<em>Zintegrowana Platforma Analityczna – </em>ZPA) is being designed for warehousing and analysing data collected from both public administration and commercially available sources. The objective is to create a common data format, which will make it possible to compare and analyse data so that public institutions are able to draw practical conclusions and make strategic decisions. Bringing together BigData analytics and market intelligence, the platform will provide tools enabling forecasting, developing strategy models and finally making decisions based on credible data. </p><p>The first concept of the project was drafted in November 2017 and developed throughout 2018. In the process, six major social issues were identified as priorities to be solved by the Polish government. The platform will provide solutions enabling data analysis, which will enable the responsible institutions to undertake the appropriate action to solve their problems.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474997"></a>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle">eIDAS Node</p><p>Poland’s eIDAS Node enables a single login and password for Polish citizens in electronic services of EU Member States, and for citizens of other EU countries in Polish electronic services.</p><p>So far, Polish citizens can set up a Trusted Profile and use it only in national e-services. Foreign nationals cannot use his/her national eID in Polish e-services. </p><p>The Polish eIDAS Node allows citizens to extend their use of a Trusted Profile for electronic services of other countries. In the same way, citizens of EU countries will be able to use their national eID systems to login to Polish electronic services (such as ePUAP, PUE ZUS, biznes.gov.pl etc.).</p><p>The Polish eIDAS Node is a gateway for the <a href="https://login.gov.pl/login/main">National Electronic Identification Node</a>. As each EU Member State implements its own electronic services and eID systems in various ways, depending on its legal and organisational aspects, eIDAS Nodes provides mechanisms for integrating the Polish National Node with relevant systems of other EU countries.</p><p>To ensure an adequate level of security, it is planned that only notified eID systems of the EU Member States will be admitted to the cross-border login system. However, allowing access to national e-services for non-notified eID systems needs bilateral agreements between countries. </p><p>Poland will notify the Trusted Profile (<em>Profil Zaufany</em>) and newly introduced eID card (personal identification document) with an implemented inside electronic layer Personal Profile (Profil Osobisty) as one scheme. Preparations for notifications are ongoing but there is no specified deadline to finish this process. Notification will last at least nine months from formal application. </p><p>The eIDAS solution allows citizens from Member States to prove and verify their identification when accessing on-line services in other Member States. It allows citizens to authenticate themselves by using their eIDs and connecting with their Identity Provider (IdP) from their country. The high-level process is as follows:</p><ol><li>The citizen requests an on-line service in a Member State.</li><li>The citizen is requested to authenticate themselves by the on-line service.</li><li>At the authentication stage, it becomes apparent that the citizen has an eID from another Member State.</li><li>The request is sent to the citizen’s country for authentication, through the eIDAS solution, to the citizen’s Identity Provider (IdP) where authentication takes place.</li><li>The authentication result is returned to the service provider.</li><li>Authentication is complete, and the citizen can proceed with accessing the service.</li></ol><p>The eIDAS Solution makes different eID national protocols interoperable with each other. The solution uses the eIDAS protocol to translate national identification data into a common format that is understood and used by Member States.</p><p>This allows the eIDs of Member States to be interoperable and accepted in other Member States, opening new possibilities and opportunities for citizens to use services across-border.</p><p class="subtitle">Single Point of Contact</p><p>The Single Point of Contact is a communication interface (node) between the Schengen Member States or Associated States. It allows for effective on-line communication, leading to regular implementation of tasks related to the exchange of cryptographic keys. In general, it will be used to exchange certificates between all countries of the Schengen area, which will enable the services (most often the Border Guard) to verify travel documents (usually passports) on this basis. Suspicious persons (or suspects) will be subject to further verification of fingerprints with imprints placed in the document.</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">System of State Registers (SSR)</p><p>The system combines five registers: PESEL, Personal Data Register, Registry of Civil Status, System of State Awards, Central Register of Objections.
