The Strategy set out the Government’s overall approach to ICT and contained a series of principles to ensure momentum was maintained in this area.</p><p>The Public Service ICT Strategy set out a high-level vision to reinforce ICT’s role in supporting Public Service Reform and transformation. It identified a number of key strategic objectives that will set the future direction for innovation and excellence in ICT within the Public Service:</p><ul><li><strong>Build to Share:</strong> creating ICT shared services to support integration across the wider Public Service to drive efficiency, standardisation, consolidation, reduction in duplication and control cost;</li><li><strong>Digital First:</strong> digitisation of key transactional services and the increased use of ICT to deliver improved efficiency within Public Bodies and provide new digital services to citizens, businesses and public servants;</li><li><strong>Data as an Enabler:</strong> in line with statutory obligations and Data Protection guidelines, facilitate increased data sharing and innovative use of data across all Public Bodies to enable the delivery of integrated services, improve decision making and improve openness and transparency between Government and the public;</li><li><strong>Improve Governance:</strong> ensure that the ICT strategy is aligned, directed and monitored across Public Bodies to support the specific goals and objectives at a whole-of-government level and with an emphasis on shared commitment; and </li><li><strong>Increase Capability:</strong> ensure the necessary ICT skills and resources are available to meet the current and future ICT needs of the Public Service.</li></ul><p>The Strategy builds on the ICT foundations that will deliver future government services.

The outcome of these consultations was an 18 Step Action Plan to develop the five strategic themes of the Strategy (Digital, Data, Build to Share, Governance and Capability). Implementation of the Action Plan is currently underway.</p><p>In the Public Service ICT Strategy, data have been identified as a critical enabler of better decision-making and more effective and efficient service provisioning. Government has taken steps to address some of the challenges by embarking on the National Data Infrastructure (NDI), which concerns itself with the consistent and reliable identification of data that relates to a particular location – through the use of an Eircode; person – through the use of a Personal Public Service Number (PPSN); business – through the use of a Unique Business Identifier (UBI). The consistent identification of these core data assets is crucial to successfully linking data, joining up government, and delivering integrated services. The <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/1d6bc7-public-service-data-strategy-2019-2023/">Public Service Data Strategy 2019 – 2023</a> sets the NDI (and the <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2019/act/5/enacted/en/html">Data Sharing and Governance Act 2019</a>) in the wider context of building a coherent data management ecosystem for the Public Service.</p><p>The <a href="http://ictstrategy.per.gov.ie/ictstrategy/files/Public Service ICT Strategy 18 Step Action Plan.pdf">18 Step Action Plan</a> developed by the <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/6ee40f-office-of-the-government-chief-information-officer-ogcio/">Office of the Government Chief Information Officer</a> to progress the Public Service ICT Strategy focuses on five strategic themes. There has been good progress across all five pillars:</p><ul><li>The Build to Share Common Applications are already proving a major success in Departments. The suite includes eSubmissions, ePQ (parliamentary questions) eDocs (to manage correspondence), and eFOI (to manage Freedom of Information requests). There is an ongoing rollout programme to implement all these applications across Departments and agencies. All Ministerial Departments are now on-boarded to the platform as well as a growing number of agencies.  The process to on-board other organisations is at an advanced stage which will bring the user-base of Build to Share Applications close to 30,000 potential users.</li><li>The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer also has a number of initiatives as part of government’s response to cloud computing. The Government Cloud Network (GCN) service provides private, cost-effective, high speed network services to Public Service Bodies across the country. As of November 2017, there are 350 nodes on GCN including central Government Departments, the Local Authority sector, Education and Training Boards and various Government bodies.</li><li>In addition, the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is working with a number of Government Departments on plans to establish a Pan-Public Service Data Centre.</li><li>The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer is continuing the development of <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/">gov.ie</a>, a digital portal to make it easier for citizens to find government services online; supporting better use of data across government in line with best practice in data protection and sharing; and developing a sustainable resourcing model for ICT across the Public Service.</li></ul><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Open Data Strategy </p><p>A new <a href="http://www.per.gov.ie/en/strategy-aims-to-make-ireland-a-leader-in-open-data-odonovan/">Open Data Strategy</a> for the period 2017-2022 was published in July 2017.

The Act comes in the wake of the GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 in order to clarify and strengthen the data sharing rights and obligations of public bodies. The Act paves the way for more efficient and cost-effective service delivery by public bodies by providing a clear legal basis for the sharing of personal data in certain circumstances. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden associated with the need for individuals to provide their personal data to numerous public bodies. The Act allows for the sharing of personal data between public bodies where the sharing is for the performance of a function of either of the public bodies. The Act provides for the establishment of a personal data access portal. This is a portal that would allow individuals to view their personal data as well as information in relation to any data breaches affecting their personal data and data sharing agreements under which their personal data is processed. Besides, the Act allows the Minster to designate base registries for use by public bodies so that they can access personal data without having to collect it directly from service users. A base registry will have an owner who must ensure the personal data is accurate and up to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474971"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p>There is no specific legislation in this area; existing laws apply where appropriate.</p><h1><a id="_Toc12874785"></a>Digital Government Governance</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474973"></a>National </h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474974"></a>Policy</h3><p class="subtitle"><a href="http://per.gov.ie/">Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</a></p><p>The overall responsibility for the eGovernment policy and the provision of central eGovernment infrastructure and services lies with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. </p><table><tr><td><p><img src="img/36-21.png" alt="Paschal-Donohoe" /></p></td><td><p><strong>Paschal Donohoe TD</strong></p><p><strong>Minister for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Contact details:</strong></p><p>Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</p><p>Government Buildings</p><p>Upper Merrion Street, Dublin 2 </p><p><strong>Tel.:</strong> +353 1 676 75 71</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> +353 1 678 99 36</p><p><strong>E-mail:</strong> minister@per.gov.ie </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> http://per.gov.ie/</p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><p><img src="img/36-22.jpeg" alt="http://www.per.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/Patrick-ODonovan-headshot-233x300.jpg" /></p></td><td><p><strong>Patrick O’Donovan TD</strong></p><p><strong>Minister of State at the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, with special responsibility for Public Procurement, Open Government and eGovernment</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Contact details:</strong></p><p>Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</p><p>Government Buildings</p><p>Upper Merrion Street, Dublin 2 </p><p><strong>Tel.: </strong>+353 1 676 75 71</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> +353 1 678 99 36</p><p><strong>E-mail:</strong> <a href="mailto:patrick.odonovan@oir.ie">patrick.odonovan@oir.ie</a></p><p><strong>Source: </strong>http://per.gov.ie/</p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><p><img src="img/36-23.png" alt="36-23.png" /></p></td><td><p><strong>Barry Lowry</strong></p><p><strong>Government Chief Information Officer</strong></p><p><strong>Contact details:</strong></p><p>Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</p><p>Government Buildings</p><p>Upper Merrion Street, Dublin 2, </p><p><strong>Tel.:</strong> +353 1 676 75 71</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> +353 1 678 99 36</p><p><strong>E-mail:</strong> <a href="mailto:barry.lowry@per.gov.ie">barry.lowry@per.gov.ie</a> </p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href="http://www.per.gov.ie/management-chart-2/">http://per.gov.ie/</a></p></td></tr></table><h3><a id="_Toc1474975"></a>Coordination</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474976"></a>Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/6ee40f-office-of-the-government-chief-information-officer-ogcio/">Office of the Government Chief Information Officer</a> (OGCIO) within the <a href="http://per.gov.ie/">Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</a> has overall responsibility for coordinating the implementation of eGovernment policy across the Public Service in Ireland. </p><h3>Implementation</h3><p class="subtitle"><strong>Government Departments and Agencies</strong></p><p>Individual Government Departments and Agencies are responsible for developing specific eGovernment plans in relation to their own areas of operation and for implementing eGovernment projects within the framework of their competences.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474977"></a>Support</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1035643"></a><a id="_Toc1474978"></a>Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</p><p>The OGCIO within the <a href="http://per.gov.ie/">Department of Public Expenditure and Reform</a> monitors eGovernment development and provides reports as required to Government.</p><h3>Base registry coordination</h3><p class="subtitle">Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection</p><p>The organisation of the <a href="https://www.welfare.ie/en/pages/general-register-office.aspx">Civil Registry</a> is distributed in the Republic of Ireland.
