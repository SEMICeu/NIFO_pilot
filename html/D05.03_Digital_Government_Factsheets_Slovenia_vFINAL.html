The detailed objectives of this strategy included:</p><ul><li>Raising general awareness of the importance of information and communications technologies (ICT) and the Internet for the development of society;</li><li>Sustainable, systematic and targeted investment in the development of a digital society;</li><li>General digitalisation according to the “Digital by Default” principle;</li><li>Competitive digital entrepreneurship and digital industry for digital growth;</li><li>Intensive and innovative use of ICT and the Internet in all segments of society;</li><li>High speed access, open internet for all;</li><li>Inclusive digital society;</li><li>Secure cyberspace;</li><li>Trust and confidence in cyberspace and the protection of human rights;</li><li>Slovenia – a point of reference for the deployment of innovative approaches in the use of digital technologies.</li></ul><p>The Strategy’s vision called on Slovenia to take advantage of the development opportunities of ICT and the Internet, thus becoming an advanced digital society and reference environment for the deployment of innovative approaches in the use of digital technologies at a systemic level. At the same time, a high level of protection of personal data and communication privacy in a digital society should be ensured. This will create trust and confidence in digitalisation and cyberspace.</p><p>The Government favours investments in the digitalisation of entrepreneurship, an innovative data-driven economy, and the development and use of the Internet, smart communities, cities and homes. Within these limits, it favours research and technology development of the ‘Internet of things’, cloud computing, Big Data and mobile technologies. Because the Government wishes to enable equal integration into the single European digital area for Slovenian stakeholders, it innovatively uses ICT and the Internet in all developmental areas. In the future, it will invest in education to promote the digital society.</p><p>In order to digitalise the economy and society, to raise greater general awareness on the developmental importance of ICT and the Internet, to improve digital literacy, for the economically active, develop better eSkills, and to create a larger number of skilled ICT professionals, all stakeholders must be connected to Slovenia’s digitalisation, not only industry, but also non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders. For this reason, the Slovenian Digital Coalition was established.</p><p class="subtitle">Public Administration 2020 – Slovenian Public Administration Development Strategy 2015 – 2020</p><p>The <a href="http://www.mju.gov.si/nc/en/media_room/news/article/1328/6505/">Strategy</a>’s main purpose is to set a platform for a real improvement in the  operations of Slovenia’s public administration which is about to undergo modernisation and renewal. Reform will be achieved by introducing a comprehensive management system through centralised strategic planning, introducing quality control systems for the simplification and modernisation of administrative processes, as well as monitoring and evaluation of the work done and targets to be achieved across all levels. Effective public administration cannot be achieved without efficient government IT. It will take advantage of new opportunities and the potential offered by modern technological and organisational approaches, of which cloud computing has one of the greatest potentials. Improving the state of ICT in public administration will have significant synergistic effects in achieving other strategic targets, as well as in the development of the information society as a whole. </p><p>This will require effective informatics, the increased use of eServices, digitalisation and interoperability of information solutions, all of which were encompassed in a special strategic objective, The Public Administration Development Strategy 2015-2020 (hereinafter: PADS 2020). In addition to the direct effects on central government, indirect positive impacts were anticipated for the entire public administration (particularly local self-government, public institutions, and agencies), whose business processes are linked to the central government. Efficient governmental IT, argued the Strategy, had the potential to significantly contribute to the digitalisation of business processes and therefore improve the quality, transparency, and accountability in public administration.</p><p>Data governance is a prerequisite for data driven developments, operations, decisions, and innovative approaches. In this context, the set of actions are in place. The development of central metadata dictionary is a priority and is also the prerequisite for data repository. A data repository will provide views with different perspectives and contexts, which will be the root for the knowledge and understanding of the data. The repository will provide information on how applications are connected to the data, what institutions are responsible for the data, and how data is used through public administration procedures.</p><p><a id="_Hlk8376358"></a>In the context of the Slovenian Public Administration Development Strategy 2015 - 2020, which also covered the digital government strategy, the government adopted an action plan every two years. In 2018, the new <a href="http://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/strategija+upravljanja+semanticne+interoperabilnosti?lang=en">Semantic Interoperability Implementation Strategy</a> was prepared. With the help of tools and procedures defined in the Strategy we intend to address the following areas:</p><ul><li>Once Only Principle,</li><li>More efficient and standardised planning of information solutions models (for new and re-engineering existing ones), </li><li>Greater degree of reliability and quality of data exchanged between systems (one truth rule, same understanding of the meaning of data for all users).</li></ul><p>In the field of emerging technologies, an Action plan for the preparation of the basis for the enhanced implementation of blockchain technologies and building the corresponding environment for the regulation of crypto currencies and blockchain as such in relevant regulatory areas was adopted</p><p class="subtitle">Reorganisation and Centralisation of the Government IT </p><p>Slovenia’s public administration can accomplish potential cost savings and maximise efficiency in the next couple of years with the adoption of various <a href="http://www.vlada.si/teme_in_projekti/projektna_pisarna/p4_reorganizacija_informatike_v_drzavni_upravi/">measures</a>. IT centralisation comprises centralised management of infrastructure, communications, joint software, financial and human resources, IT public procurement and security policy, as well as consolidation of fundamental data registers, common building blocks and trust services. This involves the following measures:</p><p>Infrastructure consolidation:</p><ul><li>Building of unified and consolidated information systems of public administration;</li><li>Reference architecture and standardisation of information systems of public administration;</li><li>Establishing a vendor management team;</li><li>Introducing a Government Cloud (DRO): in 2015, the on-premise Government Cloud was established. This was continued by the migration of public administration IT systems to a cloud infrastructure and the consolidation of data centres. </li></ul><p>The Government Cloud established a computer infrastructure for direct budget users, providing them a landing zone for big data, storage (app store) and common solutions. It increased innovation opportunities for service providers, including SMEs and public administrations, as evidenced through the implementation of advanced cloud infrastructures and services. The Government Cloud contributed to the simplification and streamlining of development and maintenance procedures of IT, as well as improvement of national authorities’ operation. Specific initiatives included the following: </p><ul><li>The modernisation of the Government Central Communication System (HKOM), a new business model with expanding capacities. In September 2016, the Government cloud and HKOM were certified by the Cisco Cloud and Managed Services Programme as the first state owned cloud;</li><li>Developing applications for the next generations. Promoting the use of modern methods of development and management of critical applications;</li><li>Full integration of horizontal building blocks in terms of development of information solutions;</li><li>Information security. Providing a safe IT environment for public authorities through pragmatic approaches to security policy;</li><li>Implementing a unified security policy and establishing SIGOVCERT;</li><li>Introducing a government service centre helpdesk: a single helpdesk centre for public administration, enterprises, and citizens. The Service Centre represents consolidation of all service centres for ICT user support, with a focus on quality, standards and lower costs.  </li><li>Centralisation of IT support for public administration;</li><li>A single portal IT services; and </li><li>Offering an online catalogue of IT services, adapted to public administration applications.</li></ul><p>IT reorganisation and centralisation processes are expected to bring standardisation and unification and, as such, positively impact public sector efficiency while increasing budget savings. These combined measures were expected to bring savings of about 20 million EUR by 2020. The Government cloud established computer infrastructure for direct budget users, provided them a landing zone for big data, storage (app store) and common solutions. It increased innovation opportunities for service providers, including SMEs and public administrations, as evidenced through the implementation of advanced cloud infrastructures and services. The State Cloud contributed to the simplification and streamlining of the development and maintenance procedures of IT, as well as the improvement of national authorities’ operations.</p><p>The Government Cloud DRO offers an efficient and reliable infrastructure for the functioning of critical IT systems in Public Administration. It was designed technically to provide the highest level of security. It consists of three equivalent infrastructures. The critical applications run parallel and equivalent on all three active infrastructures. DRO will bring better services for its users, citizens and companies, and not only electronic services, but also in F2F interaction through administrative units. DRO can rely on the knowledge and experience of 38 IT companies (involved in the project of DRO establishment) and their experts. DRO also represents development platforms for innovative processing and simulation between mass data (Big Data). </p><p>The migration is planned for existing applications to the cloud infrastructure and implementation of the new application development methodology. The application development will be aligned with cloud computing concepts and supported by tools, standards, software patterns and trainings. A special emphasis will be given to civil servants’ training through the Raising Digital Competences’ project, financed by the European Social Fund and carried out by the Academy of Public Administration, with the help of public administration professionals. Slovenia will provide an innovative environment that will enable the implementation of new eServices for the private sector and encouraging the research of academia. To reach this goal, innovative cloud services will be established. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>Security aspects related to digital government</h3><p class="subtitle">Cyber Security Strategy</p><p>The <a href="http://www.uvtp.gov.si/fileadmin/uvtp.gov.si/pageuploads/Cyber_Security_Strategy_Slovenia.pdf">Cyber Security Strategy</a> established the framework for an integrated national system to ensure cyber security on a high level.

The OPSI Portal represents a single national web site for publishing open data for the entire public sector and has a dual function. First, it represents the central catalogue of records and databases in the country; it is a central inventory of metadata from all records and databases managed by state authorities, municipalities and other public sector bodies. Second, it represents a single website for publishing data from collections in open and machine-readable formats. The portal provides everyone with the right to a free and easy reuse of freely accessible data published in the way of ‘open data’ for any (non-profit or profit) purpose. On the portal, all public sector bodies publish data by category. Currently, over 4 000 data sets are published on the portal (at least with metadata). </p><p>The goal is to establish the so-called Open Data Ecosystem - based on the OPSI Portal and to encourage cooperation between all stakeholders concerned by the opening and / or re-use of data:</p><ul><li>All public sector institutions: state bodies, local communities, administrative units, public institutes, agencies, public service providers, etc.;</li><li>Educational institutions, such as secondary schools, faculties, various research institutes;</li><li>Non-governmental organisations;</li><li>Research journalists;</li><li>Start-up companies, small and medium-sized enterprises and larger companies;</li><li>The digital economy.</li></ul><p>Slovenia has been ranked number seven in the field of open data for the past two years.

The modules are integrated into a comprehensive system on a single platform that will enable conducting public procurement procedures in a fully electronic way. The eProcurement system e-JN was built with different levels of interoperability in mind. It was designed based on interoperable IT solutions (horizontal building blocks) for data distribution, authentication, identification and eSignature. It also uses web services, provided by Slovenian agencies, especially AJPES (Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Public Legal Records and Related Services), who is responsible for Slovenian Business register, Official Public Gazette for eTendering purposes and other institutions that provide data on economic operators. It is also connected with software for office and financial system that is widely used in public administration. </p><p class="subtitle">zVEM Portal </p><p>The patient portal zVEM was launched in January 2017.

There are sub-portals available for Slovenia’s Italian and the Hungarian national minorities and information is classified according to life events. Each insight into the specific life situations of citizens and businesses is associated with links leading to public administration web pages of similar content.</p><p>In November 2015, the eGovernment state portal was launched. It was completely redesigned using a new system architecture and a new user interface. It was based on a CMS system, which enables effortless content maintenance.</p><p>The portal follows modern principles of user interface design. It is simple, responsive and strictly user-centric. It meets the needs of people with disabilities, especially persons with vision or hearing impairments, by using different visual themes as well as videos with interpreted sign language.</p><p>Another significant improvement is in the content. In cooperation with professional copywriters, content editors tried to prepare texts that are precise but simple enough for everyone to understand, and that ensure the users’ needs are kept in focus. Large parts of the portal are translated to the languages of Slovenia's national minorities (Italian and Hungarian). There is also an English sub-portal with adapted content, which mostly meets the needs of foreigners living in or moving to Slovenia.</p><p>More than 30 back offices, registers and other data bases are connected to the portal. Services are provided according to the life events. </p><p>The main value of the renewed portal are the electronic services, which are seamlessly integrated into the content and easily accessible. Users may access various services (currently about 250) through the integration of public bodies’ information systems. Every authenticated user can use their digital certificate to access personal storage, which allows them to store their private documents. The users can also view their personal data from various public records (e.g. personal information, information about their vehicle and real estate property).</p><p>The state portal will continue to improve its eServices a higher level of the principle “I know everything my state knows about me” will be achieved, access to various public records and display of one’s own personal data to an individual.</p><p><a href="http://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/centralni+sistem+za+streznisko+epodpisovanje+sices?lang=en">eUprava</a> is the first portal that enables its users to authenticate and eSign the applications with mobile phones.

Through the e-VEM portal, businesses can use electronic services to establish a company and other obligatory or frequent procedures, either when starting up or later (the submission of forms for social insurance registration, declaration of modifications to information on family members, notification of needs for workers, declaration of tax information, etc.). Users can carry out certain procedures by themselves online, using a valid digital certificate, while for some other more complicated procedures they would need to visit one of the 139 One Stop Shop contact points, the VEM point or a public notary. </p><p>The main advantages of the e-VEM Portal are: it enables a free of charge sole trader registration within one day (in the past it took seven days), the registration of a company with limited liabilities within three days (in the past it took more than 60 days). It also enables several eServices. In 2018, more than two million applications were processed through e-VEM Portal, which has more than 80 000 registered users. </p><p>The majority of services carried out via the e-VEM portal or SPOT points are free of charge. The development of new services for e-VEM is continuing. In terms of the development of new services, relevant stakeholders are being involved and the principles of interoperability are followed. The development is carried out with the cooperation of different governmental bodies. It includes the connection of different IT systems into the e-service of e-VEM, aiming at re-using already available data from different registries or systems, and following the once-only principle, where possible.</p><p class="subtitle">GOV.SI portal</p><p>In 2016 the Slovenian government approved a new editorial project to avoid duplication of content on national websites and the main government portal.

The register was established based on the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing. The beneficial owners register is a main repository of the beneficial ownership information, since the identification of a natural person that is owning or controlling a business entity is one of the conditions for a successful prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. The purpose of establishing a beneficial owners register was to ensure transparency in the ownership structures of business entities and providing access to credible information for law enforcement authorities. Legal entities were obliged to enter the data on their beneficial owners until 19 January 2018. The purpose was to implement anti-money laundering and terrorism financing measures. Since then, public data about beneficial owners has been public with authorised entities having access to all data in the register.</p><p class="subtitle"><a href="http://www.fu.gov.si/fileadmin/Internet/Davki_in_druge_dajatve/Podrocja/Dohodnina/Dohodek_iz_dejavnosti/Opis/GB_Podrobnejsi_opis_3_izdaja_Brosura_za_sobodajalce_-_fizicne_osebe.docx">Register of Accommodation Facilities and eTourism</a></p><p>In December 2017, AJPES established the <a href="http://www.fu.gov.si/fileadmin/Internet/Davki_in_druge_dajatve/Podrocja/Dohodnina/Dohodek_iz_dejavnosti/Opis/GB_Podrobnejsi_opis_3_izdaja_Brosura_za_sobodajalce_-_fizicne_osebe.docx">Register of Accommodation Facilities and eTourism</a> system. The register was implemented on the legal basis of the Hospitality Industry Act and eTourism system under the Residence Registration Act. The following three goals were achieved by the register and the eTourism system:</p><ul><li>Establishment of unique evidence of all accommodation facilities – the Register of Accommodation Facilities;</li><li>Unified reporting of guest book data from all accommodation facilities; and</li><li>Reduction of administrative burdens and costs for both reporters and recipients.</li></ul><p>The Register of Accommodation Facilities is publicly accessible on the AJPES web portal and free of charge. To simplify the reporting of information, and to increase the quality of the collected data, the owners of accommodation facilities report guest arrival information only once through the AJPES eTourism system. Previously, such reporting was carried out separately to the Police, Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia and municipalities. With this new arrangement, AJPES provides collected data for the purpose of keeping records of guests, for statistical purposes and for tax collection purposes.</p><p class="subtitle">Slovenian Central Register of Population (CRP) </p><p>Every Slovenian citizen has to register with the <a href="http://www.genis.si/genisweb/MainControler?template=pageb&amp;id=07AE7F2ED499C561C125742E00178CC5">Slovenian Central Register of Population (CRP)</a>.
