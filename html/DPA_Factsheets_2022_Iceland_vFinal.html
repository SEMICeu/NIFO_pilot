The figure below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-223.png" alt="35-223.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Iceland in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-262.x-emf" alt="35-262.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Iceland’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles.<a id="_Hlk75095238"></a> Areas in need of improvement are concentrated in the Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 5 (Technological Neutrality and Data Portability), 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility)<a id="_Hlk75095734"></a>, 9 (Multilingualism), and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Indeed, the alignment and tailoring of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies comply partially with the EIF (Principle 1 – Recommendation 1) and the country should impose less technological solutions on citizens, businesses and other administrations that are technology-specific or disproportionate to their real needs (Principle 5 – Recommendation 8). Other areas of improvement in order to reach a higher score concern the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure that all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14), and the implementation of evaluation mechanisms to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of interoperable solutions (Principle 12 – Recommendation 19). </p><p><img src="img/35-276.x-emf" alt="35-276.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Icelandic results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall very good performance. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the area of interoperability governance. More specifically, the score of 2 for Iceland in Recommendations 22, 23 and 24, all referring to the need to have process and catalogues for standards and work standardisation as well as to take into account relevant EU recommendations and seek to make the approach consistent across borders, lowers the overall governance interoperability result for Iceland. </p><p><img src="img/35-288.x-emf" alt="35-288.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Iceland’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a lower-medium performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with all components except the conceptual model itself. More specifically, the country should increase its efforts with regard to internal information sources and services and open data by, for example, developing a shared infrastructure of reusable services and information sources that can be used by all public administrations (Internal Information Sources and Services – Recommendation 36) and establishing procedures and processes to integrate the opening of data in common business processes, working routines, and in the development of new information systems (Open Data – Recommendation 41). Another area of improvement is security and privacy; in order to reach a higher score, Iceland should enhance the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (Security and Privacy – Recommendation 47).</p><p>Additional information on Iceland’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity:</strong> indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services:</strong> indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers:</strong> indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The <a href="https://www.government.is/news/article/2018/01/18/Fjarskipti-Island-ljostengt/">Iceland Rural Fibre Project</a> is a government initiative to roll out optical cable connections to nearly all permanent residences in rural areas from 2016 to 2022. The state contributes to the funding of the project, and local governments can apply for subsidies to supplement their own contributions. The project operates under the auspices of the Telecommunications Fund. Fibre rollout in rural areas also plays a role in upgrading core communications systems nationwide, which is a prerequisite for greater reliability, coverage and data-transmission speed across all mobile networks in the entire country. The project will conclude in 2022, having contributed to the main broadband policy goal, namely that 99% of households and businesses nationwide have fibre access or are within 50 meters from fibre access by the end of 2025.

The contract was renewed on 1 June 2021 and is valid for 5 years. The country teamed up with a single IT partner for the provision of a common cloud platform: Microsoft 365.</p><p>The introduction of Microsoft 365 aims to consolidate all services into a single license, while guaranteeing increased communication and collaboration between institutions. </p><p>Peter Quarfordts Skov, Public Sector Director at Microsoft Denmark &amp; Iceland, commented that the contract marked a shift in the way public sector and public services are perceived. He added that, as more countries digitalise their public services, there is an increasing need to enhance services, products and processes, not to mention the level of security. Although the decision should lead to increased interoperability among different public bodies, it increases the risk of vendor lock-in.<a id="_Hlk67487692"></a></p><p class="subtitle">Core Services of Island.is</p><p>Digital Iceland is developing so-called core solutions to facilitate the development of digital services on Island.is. The aim of the solutions is to support and co-ordinate the development of digital public service processes. The Island.is core services are briefly described here below.</p><p><strong>Straumurinn (x-Road)</strong> is a data transfer layer designed to facilitate communication between information systems securely. It is currently used by 34 legal entities, with information input from 10 parties. The system will promote the automation of services by facilitating the automation process.</p><p><strong>Island.is</strong> <strong>login service</strong> offers secure access to self-service digital solutions of public entities. A new login service was launched in 2021. It includes a system enabling authorised agents to log in on behalf of companies, as well as individuals acting on behalf of family members or representatives of persons with disabilities. The agency system ensures the traceability of the person who logs in on behalf of another and thus ensures the security of the client granting the agent authorisation.</p><p><strong>Island.is mailbox</strong> is a communication solution that enables public authorities to send material securely to individuals and legal entities. The Act on a Digital Mailbox sets out the government's goal of enabling individuals and companies to access all principal public sector data through the mailbox by 2025. At year-end 2021, 32 public entities were using a digital mailbox to share data, and in 2021 around 8 million documents were made available.</p><p><strong>Island.is application system </strong>is a tool available to public entities to build user-friendly digital applications for the public service they provide. The application system enables institutions to use digital technology to reduce costs while greatly improving services for users. </p><p><strong>Island.is</strong> <strong>institutional pages </strong>give public entities the opportunity to move their websites under the technical framework of Island.is with the associated gains in efficacy and cost-efficiency. This arrangement encourages public entities to focus on their core tasks and services to the public by utilising the technical framework, design system and content policy of Island.is for their websites.</p><p><strong>Island.is My pages</strong> was redesigned in 2021 with users' needs and accessibility issues in mind. The solution provides public entities with the possibility to link the data currently provided on their My pages to Island.is, which can reduce the number of similar public sector pages. This increases cost-efficiency and gives users access to more data at fewer locations, improving user experience.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key Enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>Laws on the re-use of public sector information</p><p>Iceland already has laws on the use and re-use of public sector information. These laws are under revision in accordance with EU Directive 2019/1024 on the subject.

The stated goal of the NOBID project is to offer citizens and businesses borderless access to digital services throughout the Nordic-Baltic region using their own national eIDs. The project aims to identify both technical and legal barriers and set the requirements for enabling interoperability both nationally and in a Nordic and Baltic context. In order to succeed in such transnational projects, digital identity matching is necessary, i.e. the eIDs in different countries need to refer to the same individual. Pilot projects on identity matching between the Nordic and Baltic countries will commence in 2022.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic identification</p><p>Auðkenni ehf. is the issuer of electronic identification in Iceland.

One of the main roles of the centre is to collect information on language technology in Iceland and make it available online to <strong>facilitate</strong> both cooperation among interested parties and the use of available resources.</p><p class="subtitle">Icelandic Library Consortium </p><p>The Icelandic Library Consortium runs a union <strong>catalogue </strong>of<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.landskerfi.is/">Icelandic libraries</a>, known as Gegnir. The company, which was founded in November 2001, is owned by the Icelandic government and a series of municipalities around the country. Its purpose is to run a central, web-based library system for most of the libraries in Iceland, thus making the best possible use of the country’s modest library and information resources. A contract between Ex Libris and the Consortium of Icelandic libraries provides for the new library system to be used by all or almost all the approximately 400 libraries in the country, and that legacy data is added to the new system in steps, based on existing systems.</p><p class="subtitle">Web of Science (<em>Vísindavefur</em>) </p><p>The <a href="http://www.visindavefur.hi.is/">Icelandic Web of Science</a> was established in 2000. It contains <strong>information </strong>on all<strong> scientific fields</strong>, ranging from astronomy to ancient manuscripts. Visitors can find answers to a wide variety of questions; if they fail to find the relevant information, they have direct access to the experts responsible for maintaining and updating the web. The <em>Visindavefur</em> is supported both by public institutions and private companies.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Competence</p><p>There are several joint efforts on improving the digital competence of both employees of the public and private sectors. </p><p><strong>The digital competence wheel </strong>is a<strong> </strong>project provided by one of the workers unions. It gives those who participate in the survey a graphical overview of their digital competency. The survey is open to everyone. </p><p><strong>Elements of AI</strong> is an open online course that the Government of Iceland has invested in to strengthen the Icelandic nation and increase its competitiveness. The course is a part of the action plan for Iceland to meet the technical challenges of the future, with the aim of cultivating knowledge, its structure and flow throughout society. The objectives of the project are:</p><ul><li>Making AI knowledge accessible to all so that people can find power and opportunity in new technology, rather than seeing it as a threat;</li><li>Empowering the Icelandic nation and increasing its competitiveness; and</li><li>Strengthening the working opportunities and working competences of Icelanders.</li></ul><p>Elements of AI is a 30-hour online course divided into six chapters that individuals can take when it is convenient for them, on a computer or on the phone, and it is designed to be accessible to most people, regardless of age, work experience, or other factors.<br />The course has received several awards (including from the MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and is named first in the category of online courses on computer science, ahead of well-known academic institutions such as Stanford, Harvard, and the MIT.</p><h2>Cross-border Platforms</h2><p class="subtitle">EUCARIS, EULISSTORK</p><p>Iceland is a member of <a href="https://www.eucaris.net/">EUCARIS</a> and EULIS, sharing master data across its borders. Additionally, Registers Iceland is a member of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/content/stork-take-your-e-identity-you-everywhere-eu">Stork</a> and <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/end-stork-20-major-achievements-making-access-mobility-eu-smarter">Stork 2.0</a> projects, as well as the ELF and e-Sens projects.</p><p>Registers Iceland operates a PEPS broker, built in the Stork project, to retrieve the ID attributes needed for cross-border authentication. It is now upgrading to the eIDAS node to comply with the eIDAS Regulation and CEF funding, to federate the Icelandic eID systems with the EU eID ecosystem. This will enable the exchange of ID attributes from the Member States’ Population Registries for cross-border identification and authentication.</p><p class="subtitle">Nordic Ministerial Digital Committee </p><p>In conjunction with the Digital North 2.0 declaration and joint work between the Nordic and Baltic countries, there are both formal and informal work processes intended to develop cross-border services. One work stream as a part of the Nordic Ministerial Digital Committee is the Cross-border Digital Services Programme (CBDS), which among other things is responsible for the NOBID project, see chapter 3.3.2.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a><a id="_Hlk67487862"></a>Base Registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Current Status</p><p>Data accessibility to and reusability of data of base registries varies. Some registries - such as the Land Registry, Address Registry and the Map of Estimated Farmland Registry - make their data available free of charge on the <a href="http://www.opingogn.is">open data portal</a>. Other registries provide access to certain data on specific websites free of charge. On the <a href="http://www.skra.is">Registers Iceland website</a>, users can view data on individual properties by looking up the address or the property number. On the Directorate of Internal Revenue webpage, users can access information on businesses. </p><p>The administration of the base registries is coordinated by number of public bodies in Iceland, with each base registry handling its respective master data type(s). </p><p>In particular:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://skra.is/english/">National Population and Properties Registry</a> is managed by the Ministry of Infrastructure and contains master data related to personal data (natural and legal persons) and property data.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.samgongustofa.is/umferd/okutaeki/okutaekjaskra/uppfletting/">Vehicle Registry</a> is managed by the Ministry of Infrastructure and contains master data related to vehicles.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.rsk.is/fyrirtaekjaskra/">Business Registry</a> is managed by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and contains master data related to business and legal persons.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.skra.is/english/properties/property-registration/">Property Registry</a> is managed by the Ministry of Infrastructure and contains master data related to land and properties.</li></ul><p>There are also a number of data sharing agreements:</p><ul><li>The National Population Registry is distributed by means of agents throughout the society and widely used both by public and private entities. Public authorities have access to more information than private entities, in order to fulfil their duties. The entities pay for their use according to an agreement with Registers Iceland.</li><li>The Properties Registry is both accessible online and shared through various entities. The entities pay for the use according to an agreement with Registers Iceland.</li></ul><p>Incorporation of the EU Open Data Directive (EU 2018/1807) into the EEA Agreement is under revision by the EFTA states. Should it be incorporated into the agreement, an updated legislation of all countries should support both a common catalogue of the base registries and high value datasets. </p><h2>Emerging Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No infrastructure was reported in this field to date.</p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No infrastructure was reported in this field to date.</p><h3>Big data</h3><p>No infrastructure was reported in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud computing</h3><p>No infrastructure was reported in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No infrastructure was reported in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance computing</h3><p>No infrastructure was reported in this field to date.</p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p>No infrastructure was reported in this field to date.</p><p><img src="img/35-770.jpeg" alt="A picture containing text, computer, person, indoor
