The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-116.x-emf" alt="32-116.x-emf" /></p><p> Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022 </a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Greece in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-137.x-emf" alt="32-137.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Greek results in Scoreboard 1 stand for an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles. Greece performs above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality). Potential areas of improvement relate to the implementation of Principles 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) for which the score of three could be further improved. Particularly, full compliance with the European accessibility standards of the Directive on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public-sector bodies (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) should be achieved. In addition, Greece could increase its score on Principle 9 (Multilingualism) to reach the maximum score of four by enhancing its use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16) and more specifically, the total number of language resources proposed to users. </p><p><img src="img/32-146.x-emf" alt="32-146.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Greece’s scores in Scoreboard 2 illustrate a very good performance of the country with scores of 4 in all the interoperability layers.

Greece has a high performance in external information sources and services, performing better than the EU average in this area. Potential areas of improvement relate to catalogues and security and privacy. To increase its score on catalogues, Greece could increase its efforts to put in place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions and use common models for describing them.</p><p><img src="img/32-172.x-emf" alt="32-172.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Greece on Cross-Border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an upper-medium performance of the country. Particularly, Greece has the maximum score of four for five principles, namely openness, reusability, technical neutrality and data portability, security and privacy as well as preservation of information. However, Greece has still margin for improvement in relation to five indicators where the country obtains a lower performance, such as Principle 10 (Administrative simplification – Cross-border). For instance, efforts could focus on simplifying processes and using digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users’ requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens (Recommendation 17).</p><p>Additional information on Greek’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="img/32-187.png" alt="32-187.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc141972977"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2>Specific political communications on digital public administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Greek government signed the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/default/files/cdr_20201207_eu2020_berlin_declaration_on_digital_society_and_value-based_digital_government_.pdf">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other EU Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies.

During his speech, PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis remarked the numerous remote transactions now available to citizens via the online platform gov.gr and accessible by smart phones and tablets. Digital Governance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis added that gov.gr recorded 1.2 billion online transactions in 2022 alone, showing a remarkable increase in the use of the platform every year. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital Transformation Bible (2020–2025)</p><p>The <a href="https://digitalstrategy.gov.gr/vivlos_pdf">Digital Transformation Bible</a> (DTB) is a record of the interventions planned in the revised <a href="https://digitalstrategy.gov.gr/">National Digital Strategy for 2020–2025</a>. It focuses mainly on: the technological infrastructure of the State, the education and training of the population for the acquisition of digital skills as well as the way Greece in which utilises digital technology in all sectors of the economy and public administration. In December 2020, the Ministry of Digital Governance launched an <a href="http://www.opengov.gr/digitalandbrief/?p=2153">open public consultation</a>, which was successfully concluded for the initial publication of the DTB. This strategy outlines the basic principles, framework, governance model and guiding principles for the digital transformation of the country, which are elaborated in six strategic axes (connectivity, digital skills, digital government, digital business, digital innovation, integration of technology in every sector of the economy) and in 17 areas of economy as horizontal and vertical interventions. In addition, it describes over <a href="https://digitalstrategy.gov.gr/projects/catalog">450 specific projects</a>, which are expected to carry out the national digital strategy. The new strategy brings forth seven objectives, as follows: </p><ul><li>Safe, fast, and reliable access to the internet for all;</li><li>A digital State offering better digital services to all citizens in all spheres of life;</li><li>Development of digital skills for all citizens;</li><li>Facilitation of the digital transformation of enterprises;</li><li>Support and strengthening of digital innovation;</li><li>Making productive use of public administration data; and</li><li>Incorporation of digital technologies in all economic sectors.</li></ul><p>In July 2021, the Ministry of Digital Governance released the DTB by publishing a <a href="http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wEzH9d6xfVpRXdtvSoClrL8WfE5HsfDJ7l_zJjLAILKFuJInJ48_97uHrMts-zFzeyCiBSQOpYnTy36MacmUFCx2ppFvBej56Mmc8Qdb8ZfRJqZnsIAdk8Lv_e6czmhEembNmZCMxLMtX-xpQ-pVBAM-xfZr79XddQdHIRKe8XDUUNS8LXheBNS">Ministerial Decision</a> in the Official Government Gazette of 05.07.2021 (Issue B No. 2894/2021).</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_heading=h.pgp2xp4nyey9"></a>National Policy for Administrative Procedures (NPAP) </p><p><a href="https://www.et.gr/api/DownloadFeksApi/?fek_pdf=20220100146">Law 4961/2022</a> established the National Policy for Administrative Procedures (NPAP) as a coherent horizontal public policy for the documentation, evaluation, and improvement of administrative procedures. </p><p>NPAP is based on three interdependent pillars: (i) the National Registry of Administrative Procedures -MITOS, which aims to record, capture and standardize all administrative procedures; (ii) the National Program for Simplification of Procedures, as a mechanism for redesigning and streamline administrative procedures on the basis of a common methodology and a uniform and comprehensible way for presenting the simplification efforts to the public, and (iii) the Bureaucracy Observatory, as a mechanism to document the results of the National Policy, measuring the administrative burden and carrying out a continuous evaluation and assessment of the bureaucracy levels. The success of this national policy depends on the interaction of the three pillars, as the development of a central simplifications program requires both a reliable mechanism to measure the administrative burden, as well as an assessment of the simplification with ex post evaluations. A new digital platform has been designed and launched, and it will become the common point of contact between citizens and the State. In the platform, all the prescribed steps for each procedure will be recorded in an understandable, up-to-date and public manner.</p><p><a id="_heading=h.nlo34vii760y"></a></p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_heading=h.ckq8bc2d22ep"></a>National Programme for Simplification of Procedures (EPAD)</p><p>The <a href="https://diadikasies.gov.gr/epad">National Programme for Simplification of Procedures (EPAD)</a> was established in Article 45 of <a href="http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wFqnM3eAbJzrXdtvSoClrL8tP77J3eAjAx5MXD0LzQTLWPU9yLzB8V68knBzLCmTXKaO6fpVZ6Lx3UnKl3nP8NxdnJ5r9cmWyJWelDvWS_18kAEhATUkJb0x1LIdQ163nV9K--td6SIuTyxcNC4jyD2IRVAS_921rg8cLdC1b-Y4YhSEi5TPSvm">Law No. 4635/2019</a>. Under the supervision of the Prime Minister, EPAD constitutes the national, central and horizontal policy which, through a central, governmental and inter-ministerial coordination aims to plan and implement actions to redesign and simplify administrative procedures. EPAD aims to reduce bureaucracy and the administrative burden of services provided to citizens and businesses, as well as to streamline the internal functions of the public administration. Successful implementation of EPAD ultimately aims to significantly improve the daily life of all citizens and to strengthen the development dynamics of the country, while defending the public interest in the context of a modern state of law. </p><p>EPAD has the objective of creating a coherent framework of rules, methodologies and actions for the improvement and upgrading of legislation and administrative procedures. At the same time, special emphasis is placed on providing relevant public information, in order to achieve the maximum possible benefit for society, the economy and the public administration itself, all while strengthening the trust citizens have in the State. The program consists of three axes of intervention, which include actions and policies for all beneficiaries, i.e. citizens, businesses and public employees and officers: (i) quality and clarity of legislation/regulations; (ii) simple and understandable procedures, and (iii) timely and accurate information.</p><p class="subtitle">Bureaucracy Observatory</p><p>To reduce red tape in the new digital environment, Greece has also set up a <a href="https://diadikasies.gov.gr/parathrhthrio">Bureaucracy</a> Observatory based on Article 47 of <a href="http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wFqnM3eAbJzrXdtvSoClrL8tP77J3eAjAx5MXD0LzQTLWPU9yLzB8V68knBzLCmTXKaO6fpVZ6Lx3UnKl3nP8NxdnJ5r9cmWyJWelDvWS_18kAEhATUkJb0x1LIdQ163nV9K--td6SIuTyxcNC4jyD2IRVAS_921rg8cLdC1b-Y4YhSEi5TPSvm">Law No. 4635/2019</a>, currently under the Ministry of Interior (initially under the Ministry of Digital Governance).     The main mission of the Bureaucracy Observatory consists in assess and record the administrative burden deriving from legislation/regulations on citizens, businesses and civil servants. It also drafts annual reports about bureaucracy trends in Greece in quantitative and qualitative terms. Being the most widespread relevant methodology, the Standard Cost Model - SCM was chosen to facilitate identification, evaluation and calculation of administrative costs that occur when citizens and businesses comply with administrative requirements. The version of the model currently in use has been adapted and customised to Greece, aiming at the best description of the actual situation with the minimum total number of separate survey points. In particular, the General Directorate of Public Sector Administrative Procedures of the Ministry of Interior acts as the Observatory Coordination Mechanism and the National Documentation Centre (EKT) as the Executive Mechanism of the Observatory. The Observatory entails an evaluation and documentation mechanism with a mission to identify, periodically assess and evaluate administrative burden caused by both new and old regulations and administrative practices. It does so by capturing the impact of simplification actions on both administrative burden and bureaucracy. Its work is reflected in the annual reports on bureaucracy trends in Greece. The Observatory’s annual reports also include the preceding year’s implemented key actions of the National Simplification Programme. Up to date, 19 measurements in administrative burden on citizens, enterprises and civil servants have occurred in six different policy sectors.</p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-211.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

It was reformed in 2022 (articles 87-89 of Law 4961/2022), together with the regulatory framework, and it now governs the organization and operation of the National Coalition in a more flexible and functional way. The coalition is made up of organizations such as:  public and private sector bodies, civil society representatives, associations of natural and legal persons and non-governmental organizations, if they are active in fields relevant to the mission and competences of the National Coalition (i.e. technology, training/education, promotion of digital skills and employment, equality and digital accessibility issues). In this new framework, regulations were introduced to expand its competences and strengthen its role in the development of digital skills of the general population of the country, such as upgrading digital skills, enhancing the employment of human resources and supporting the digital transformation of the country at national, regional and local level.  </p><p>The Coalition also established its internal  Coordination Body and defined its responsibilities,  in order to ensure an effective coordination at a central level and the successful fulfilment of its tasks. </p><p>The objectives of the National Coalition are: (i) to facilitate cooperation between all parties; (ii) to introduce actions with the aim of enhancing digital skills, and (iii) to address the digital gap in every sector of the Greek economy and society. To achieve the above-mentioned objectives, and in accordance with the European Commission’s Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition, the following four target groups have been identified:</p><ul><li><strong>Education</strong>: enrichment and digital transformation of the learning and teaching process for pupils and students. Integral to this effort is the provision of incentives for the continuous training of teachers;</li><li><strong>Training</strong>: development of employees, unemployed and businessmen’s digital skills to promote the digital economy;</li><li><strong>Information</strong> and communications technology professionals: promotion of high-level digital skills for ICT professionals in all industry sectors; and</li><li><strong>Citizens</strong>: the objective is to enhance all citizens’ digital skills to enable them to be active in a digital society.</li></ul><p>In October 2020, the Greek government and Microsoft announced the plan ‘GR for GRowth’ through an investment that is expected to reach approximately EUR 1 billion. The ‘GR for Growth’ initiative in Greece will build data centres in the country and develop resources in the economy that will promote growth opportunities, thus supporting the people of Greece, the government and businesses. The ‘GR for Growth’ initiative includes the upgrading of digital skills for over 20 000 public servants by 2025 (the overall goal is to train a total of 100 000 public sector, business and IT professionals, educators, and students). In particular, as part of the National Coalition for Digital Skills and Employment (National Coalition), the Ministry of Digital Governance, the Ministry of Interior and the National Centre for Public Administration and Local Government are organising a series of training programmes aimed to upgrade the digital skills of civil servants. The educational programmes are interactive, as alongside the constant presence and guidance of trainers, they also include practical workshops (online labs). Participation in the programmes as well the corresponding certification are free of charge and the training is conducted in Greek and English. The programme started in June 2021 and until March of 2023 more than 5000 civil servants attended training programs.

In this process, all relevant stakeholders have been invited and have taken an active part in shaping the new framework, in order to better address the existing challenges and to be more effective. In June 2022, the design and implementation phase of the new National Interoperability Framework was completed at the Ministry of Digital Governance in strong cooperation with stakeholders from Public, Private sector and Academia. The new National Interoperability Framework meets the requirements of the existing European and Greek legislation and is aligned with the current version of European Interoperability Framework and also takes into consideration the reinforced European interoperability strategy and the forthcoming Interoperable Act. The innovation behind the updated National Interoperability Framework is that it is accompanied by an integrated governance model that will ensure its sustainability through the public participation of all public and private sector stakeholders, as well as by an Implementation Guide, which is expected to contribute decisively to the design, implementation, and evaluation of major ICT projects, as well as to the development of integrated interoperable public services. In addition, a new portal, called the new Digital Portal for the National Interoperability Framework, was developed. It aims to be the national contact point of interoperability issues for the public and private sector. The portal provides up-to-date information on issues around the field of interoperability at national and European level. It aims to contribute significantly to the delivery of effective interoperable citizen-centric digital services, satisfying at the same time the requirements of the vision of an Interoperable Europe.

The subject of the prevention and control of stereotypes and prejudices is incorporated in all axes as it must be considered and highlighted in all individual thematic policies and actions. The thematic Priority Axes are the following: </p><ul><li><strong>Priority Axis 1 ‘Preventing and combatting gender-based and domestic violence’</strong> focuses on: measures to protect women from all forms of violence; training and education of officials of the competent authorities; informing and raising awareness of the parties involved and the public. It is governed by the principles and guidelines of the Istanbul Convention.</li><li><strong>Priority Axis 2: Equal participation of women in the labour market’</strong> concerns the reduction of the work-related inequality gap in terms of employment and occupational segregation, remuneration and discrimination on the grounds of maternity and childcare, by introducing interventions initiated in the field of basic education and extended to training, further education and lifelong learning but also to actions aimed at harmonising professional, private and family life. </li><li><strong>Priority Axis 3 ‘Equal participation of women in decision-making and leadership</strong> focuses on enhancing the presence of women in positions of power and representation in political and social life, their stronger civic participation and empowering girls through education, informative events, and promoting as role models successful women who have been active and have excelled in all sectors. </li><li><strong>Priority Axis 4:</strong> Mainstreaming the gender perspective into sectoral policies’ refers to the integration of gender perspective into all perspectives of sectoral policies, where close cooperation with relevant ministries, public bodies and local government is required. Through this axis, efforts are being made to promote gender equality in budgets and policymaking, in specific vulnerable social groups and populations, in the fields of education, health, sport, culture and media. Finally, Priority Axis4 includes the enhancement of gender-based production of statistical data and research to support the monitoring, planning and refinement of gender equality promotion actions.</li></ul><p>Their refinement (specification) has been based on the analysis of the Strategy Framework as defined by the UN Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development, the Council of Europe Gender Equality Strategy 2018-2023, the European Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025, the Development Plan for the Greek Economy, and the Gender Equality requirements under the new programming period 2021-2027.</p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-271.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

It is also in charge of  managing supplying and distributing publications of the State and the wider public sector. In July 2022 the National Printing House has started the implementation of a new project that aims to redesign, simplify and model the process of reception, processing and publication of the Greek Government Gazette for all issues handled by the Organization. It will also entail the corresponding process of reception, planning and printing (or digital publishing) of other National Printing House publications. It will do so by developing a new, modern IT system, which will grant the following:</p><ul><li>A new service environment for traders, with customized features, security and user-friendly capabilities; and</li><li>A sophisticated search functionality of the Greek Government Gazette for the general public, so that the search becomes faster and fully meets the information requirements of the interested parties.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Finally, the Publicity Plan will be prepared and the focused actions of publicity of the act will be implemented, with the aim to provide information to the parties that hold transactions with the National Printing House and to the general public on the results of the act, the organizational and technological changes that have been implemented in the National Printing House procedures and the new features that will be provided to users and trader.Transformation of Consular Services Procedures</p><p>The project aims to improve the services provided by the Consular Authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the citizens, through the redesign of the existing procedures. The aim is to provide a high level of service without the need for their physical presence at the Consular Authorities, whenever possible. The redesigned procedures will be completed with the electronic submission of documents and supporting documents, as well as electronic payments. Citizens will be able to ask questions to every Consular Authority through multiple digital channels in written physical language through multiple communication channels, will receive information and replies, will be able to attach the relevant documents for each process and complete their work by submitting the relevant documents to the Consular Authorities.</p><h2><a id="_heading=h.44sinio"></a>Innovative technologies</h2><h3><a id="_heading=h.sqyw64"></a>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle">Declaration on Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence</p><p>Greece signed the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/communities/sites/jrccties/files/2018aideclarationatdigitaldaydocxpdf.pdf">Declaration on Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence (AI</a>) during the Digital Day 2018.
