In the course of this legislative period, a series of measures will strengthen the service of the state administration with a strong focus on electronic means of communication. The program presents decisive opportunities and addresses some primary challenges posed by digitisation. The Digital Agenda is a central field of action for the Legislature. There is a general consensus that administration services should be offered electronically and made available around the clock. There is also an awareness that when official business is conducted via by electronic means data security and privacy must be a high priority. </p><p class="subtitle">eGovernment Strategy 2017-2021</p><p>This <a href="https://www.regierung.li/media/attachments/ikr-eGovernmentStrategie-A4-D.PDF?t=636911057929590704">eGovernment strategy</a> is based on the knowledge gained from the implementation of an earlier strategy dating back a decade earlier. In March 2019, the Government presented its overarching considerations for future digitization, and formulated concrete fields of action in objectives and measures were articulated. </p><p>The new revised eGovernment strategy includes a vision, principles and guidelines for the implementation of digital services as well as defined areas of action. Implementation of the strategy will be carried out by means of individual projects.</p><p>Although the state administration relies heavily on eGovernment, citizens continue to enjoy non-electronic access to all administrative services. However, eGovernment should facilitate access to administrative services and make business transactions more efficient. The administration thus enables a customer-friendly, personal and competent service, both electronically and non-electronically.<a id="_Toc1474952"></a></p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>Security aspects related to digital government</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Blockchain Partnership</p><p>On 1 February 2019, the Principality of Liechtenstein signed the declaration joining the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/liechtenstein-joins-european-blockchain-partnership">European Blockchain Partnership</a>.

This is a central platform for digital innovation and networking for Liechtenstein. The site initiative is under the patronage of the Princely House and the Government and is supported by more than 40 well-known companies and organisations that want to develop Liechtenstein into a leading digital business location. The initiative bundles the relevant forces from politics, business and science, creates access to relevant networks and enables the decisive transfer of know-how for the digital transformation.</p><p class="subtitle">LLV eGovernment Portal  </p><p>In April 2014, the central national <a href="https://www.llv.li/">eGovernment Portal</a> was relaunched with a completely new responsive design, also allowing for mobile-friendly access. The original portal had actually been introduced as far back as 2004.</p><p>The new 2014 design focused on usability. The most used content was automatically presented on the top of the Index page and content was unified over all agencies. A new search function presented data in groups and drastically reduces the time needed to access necessary information. There were also new apps on the page, which provided citizens with ready access to their personal data held by the government. For the very first time, integrated services which delivered online private certificates (such as the execution-reports and criminal record reports) were included. And last, but not least there is a new feedback feature, which allows users to get in contact with the specialised unit for eGovernment. With this new user-driven suggestion system and a very fast implementation cycle, the portal has become a flexible, living platform.</p><p>The administrative portal’s technical and administrative responsibility lies with the Office of Information Technology, while content responsibility lies with the relevant government offices. The portal covers all matters related to citizen-state and business-state interaction. Related topics include among other legal matters and legislation texts, employment, taxation, all forms of declaration towards the State. Regarding its structure, the portal is comprised of three major sections:</p><ul><li>Life topics;</li><li>Public Authorities;</li><li>Online counter.</li></ul><p>The LLV eGovernment portal also offers a broad range of <a href="https://www.llv.li/#/20/">online applications</a>, such as:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.firmenindex.llv.li/">Business names index for enterprises</a>;</li><li><a href="http://geodaten.llv.li/">Geospatial Data Infrastructure (GDI)</a>;</li><li>Tax declaration;</li><li>Online calculator for price increase estimation;</li><li>Report and application service.</li></ul><p>On 1 April 2007, a section dedicated to the Government of Liechtenstein was introduced under <a href="http://www.regierung.li">www.regierung.li</a>. It provided comprehensive information on the organisation and responsibilities of various governmental departments, as well as information on the members of government.</p><p>Online services offered by the portal were further enhanced in January 2007 with a new <a href="http://www.telefonbuch.llv.li/">electronic telephone book service</a>, featuring online search facilities for the internal telephone numbers of the Public Administration. The service function offered up-to-date online information. The <a href="http://www.newsletter.llv.li/">Newsletter Service</a> of the <a href="https://www.llv.li/">eGovernment Portal</a> was enhanced to provided information on government reports, applications to the Diet, Diet protocols and draft legislation. In addition, the newsletter provides information in the areas of workplace, health promotion and on the hiking trails network in Liechtenstein.</p><p>In October 2008, a completely revised LLV central form repository and management system available to the entire public administration was released within the scope of a major important, strategic project with technical and content-related components, as well as central versatile usable basic services. In 2009, the integration of the applicant’s signature and the complex business logic was implemented, as planned in the project’s phase 2. </p><p class="subtitle">Portal of the Principality of Liechtenstein</p><p>In January 2002, the public launch of the <a href="http://www.liechtenstein.li/index.php?id=54&amp;L=1">Portal of the Principality of Liechtenstein took</a> place.

Existing networks cannot meet these requirements, which is why Liechtenstein has a competitive digital infrastructure to create the technical requirement for new digital services. The nationwide expansion of the fiber-optic network (Fiber-to-the Home) is being accelerated and the construction of a mobile 5G network is supported. The 24-hour electronic switch will be expanded so that as many office functions as possible can be handled from home. </p><p class="subtitle">Public Key Infrastructure</p><p>In April 2006, a final report on the introduction of a <a href="https://www.x-infotech.com/electronic-passport-project-liechtenstein/">Public Key Infrastructure</a> (PKI) was prepared under the supervision of the Office of Human and Administrative Resources. A highlight of the new infrastructure was electronic certification through means of electronic identity cards (June 2009). The National Electronic ID-card with a qualified electronic certificate is the primary document for identifying citizens and residents. The eID-card is used in business, governmental and private communications (identification document), and it serves as a travel document. Issued by the <a href="https://apa.llv.li/">National Immigration and Passport Office</a>, it provides advanced electronic functions facilitating secure authentication, legally binding digital signature for public and private online services. </p><p>In October 2006, Liechtenstein launched the issuance of biometric passports. An integrated microchipwass used to hold the owner’s data, such as height, signature and a passport photograph in JPEG format. The stored data can be accessed through special reading devices implementing <em>Basic Access Control </em>infrastructure.</p><p>In 2013, an awareness of difficulties involving the use of the electronic eID-card <em>lisign</em> resulted in the decision to introduce an alternative solution named <em>lilog</em> for secure authentication. It is based on username and password without hardware token and can be activated online by the holder, but only after approval by the <a href="https://apa.llv.li/">National Immigration and Passport Office</a>. The increasing number of <em>lilog</em> holders (about 5% of the inhabitants own a <em>lilog</em> by end of November 2014) shows its suitability for daily use.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474994"></a>eInvoicing</h2><p>The eInvoicing infrastructure was implemented in 2018 based on the EU Directive 2017/1870. </p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">Paymentwall</p><p>The country has projects in planning for redesign, including infrastructure of the ePayment system.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle">National Archives</p><p>The <a href="http://www.e-archiv.li/">National Archives</a> collection facilities online search and obtaining documents related to the principality’s history.</p><p class="subtitle">Law Database LILEX</p><p>The Constitution and the entire volume of Liechtenstein legislation are available for downloading free of charge from the <a href="http://www.gesetze.li/">law data base LILEX</a>.
