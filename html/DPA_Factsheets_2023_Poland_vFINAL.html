The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-371.x-emf" alt="32-371.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Poland in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-392.x-emf" alt="32-392.x-emf" />	</p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Poland’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring at the European average for all principles, except for Principle 3 (Transparency) and Principle 10 (Administrative simplification) that score below the EU average. Poland’s performance on Principle 1 increased since 2021, scoring above the EU average for this Principle. Possible areas of improvements are particularly concentrated in Principle 9 (Multilingualism) for which the score of 3 shows a medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the country could invest more efforts in information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16), so as to reach a higher score in this Principle. </p><p><img src="img/32-404.x-emf" alt="32-404.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Polish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall a strong performance with scores of 3 on interoperability governance and a score of 4 on the other layers. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance. More specifically, the score of 1 for Poland in Recommendation 23 could be improved by further consulting relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level when procuring and developing IT solutions.</p><p><img src="img/32-414.x-emf" alt="32-414.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Poland’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance, globally aligned with the European average, in the implementation of recommendations associated with all indicators of the conceptual model, expect for catalogues (no data). Poland’s scores increased for two principles since 2021: internal information sources and services (from one to four) and Security and Privacy (from three to four). However, there is room for improvement with regard to recommendations associated with external information sources and services. More specifically, the lack of use of external information sources and services while developing European public services (Recommendation 45) hinders the overall Polish score with regard to external information sources and services.</p><p><img src="img/32-426.x-emf" alt="32-426.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Poland’s results on Cross-Border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show a medium performance of the country, as well as missing data for multiple indicators. Based on the available data, Poland reaches the maximum score of four for three principles, for legal and technical interoperability, as well as open data and security and privacy. However, Poland has still margin for improvement in relation to two main indicators where the country obtains a lower performance: Principle 10 (Administrative simplification – Cross-border) and Internal information sources and services, which both scores below the EU average. To improve its performance on Principles 10, Poland’s efforts could focus on simplifying processes and using digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users’ requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens (Recommendation 17).</p><p>Additional information on Poland’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="img/32-439.png" alt="32-439.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc138930459"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific political communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government </p><p>In December 2020, the Polish government signed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other European Union (EU) Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies.

The main objective of the strategy is to create the conditions for an increase in the income of Polish citizens while improving social, economic, environmental and territorial cohesion. The key indicators of the strategy include the growth of Polish gross domestic product (GDP) per capita up to 95% of the EU28 average by 2030, and a drop in the risk of poverty and social exclusion indicator to 17 by 2030.</p><p>Ensuring a high and stable growth rate will be facilitated by the implementation of the following measures among others:</p><ul><li>Total investment growth to account for 22-25% of the GDP by 2020 and 25% by 2030;</li><li>Increase in the share of research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures to 1.7% of the GDP by 2020 and 2.5% by 2030;</li><li>Average annual growth rate of exports of 7.2% by 2020 and 6.8% by 2030; and</li><li>A 10% share of advanced technology products in total exports by 2020 and 15% by 2030. </li></ul><p>The main objectives include eGovernment measures, particularly those involving the effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the public administration. The concept of eGovernment and digital public services implies that high-quality services for citizens, including entrepreneurs, are to be provided by modern information technology (IT) solutions supporting a logical and coherent government IT system, developed and maintained with the cooperation of all actors at various levels of public administration.</p><p>A priority task in the field of eGovernment is to allow the widest possible range of public services to be provided digitally, thereby enabling citizens to handle their businesses remotely. To that end, it will be necessary to ensure the interoperability of public IT systems and to computerise the internal processes of the administration.</p><p>In this field, the strategy sets out the following measures:</p><ul><li>Providing eServices relevant for citizens and entrepreneurs;</li><li>Creating a single information and eServices website for the government administration;</li><li>Introducing a uniform and secure system for identifying citizens (eID) in the eServices systems of the public administration;</li><li>Ensuring a dominant share of digital document flow in administration and economic trade;</li><li>Increasing access to public sector information (PSI), including through application programming interfaces (APIs) for software developers;</li><li>Adopting a standard for digital documentation management systems in public administration, guaranteeing an efficient exchange of information with the public administration’s domain-specific systems; and</li><li>Integrating the eGovernment data processing infrastructure and the development of a State register system, ensuring the necessary reliability and availability of eGovernment systems and their integration.</li></ul><p>Other elements link this strategy to the European Commission’s Digital Single Market Strategy, whose implementation is governed and monitored be the Ministry of Digital Affairs.</p><p class="subtitle">Operational Programme Digital Poland 2014–2020 and European Funds for Digital Development 2021–2027</p><p>The aim of the <a href="https://www.funduszeeuropejskie.gov.pl/media/1655/POPC_eng_1632015.pdf">Operational Programme (OP) Digital Poland 2014–2020</a>, which is to be implemented until the end of 2023, is to strengthen the foundations for the development of a digital country, including broad access to high-speed internet, efficient and user-friendly public eServices, and an ever-increasing level of digital literacy in society. </p><p>This programme acknowledged that Poland was significantly lagging behind other Member States in the use of the development potential of ICT. In particular, the Council took note of:</p><ul><li>A low fixed broadband coverage;</li><li>A relatively low efficiency of public administration;</li><li>A relatively low level of use of eGovernment; and</li><li>A very low percentage of adults engaging in lifelong learning.</li></ul><p>The report recommended the development of broadband networks, and an improvement in the quality and efficiency of public services through digitalisation. The method for implementing eServices includes mechanisms to prevent the phenomenon of ‘digitalisation bureaucracy’, forcing the positive impact of projects on administrative processes, and to train as many people as possible in the use of ICT to improve their quality of life, also socially, and increase the competitiveness of the labour market. </p><p>By the end of 2021, over 1 000 000 households had been connected to high-speed internet. Human capital-related actions had resulted in 227 540 people trained in using internet, including eServices, and more than 121 300 acquiring increased digital competences. In the area of eAdministration, 99 new public eServices and 87 new databases accessible through API had been provided. </p><p>Under a combination of State and OP Digital Poland budget, the Polish government launched in 2017 the Nationwide Education Network (OSE), an initiative established to provide high-speed internet connections with at least 100 Mbps symmetrical to all schools and make more eResources available to teachers. The National Act establishing the OSE was adopted and entered into force in December 2017, and in 2018 the first educational centres were connected to the network. Since 2021, 90% of schools, over 20 000, have subscribed to OSE services.</p><p>The new edition of the OP Digital Poland for the years 2021–2027, which is named <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/ncbr-en/european-funds">European Funds for Digital Development</a> and is to be implemented until the end of 2030 with a similar thematic scope, was adopted by the government in January 2022 and approved in November by the European Commission. It contains the following components: broad access to ultra-fast internet, implementation of advanced and user-friendly public eServices, digital cross-sector cooperation, effective operation of the national cybersecurity system, support for digital skills of employees of public institutions, and digital availability and reuse of PSI.</p><p class="subtitle">Recovery and Resilience Facility for Poland </p><p>A part of the Polish Recovery and Resilience Plan aims to accelerate the digitalisation process of the country through the digital transformation of the public sector, the economy and the society. It consists of three sub-components, based on its specific objectives: </p><ul><li>Improving access to high-speed internet; </li><li>Developing and consolidating eServices, creating the conditions for the development of digital breakthrough technologies in the public sector, the economy and the society, as well as improving communication between public institutions, citizens and businesses; and</li><li>increasing security in the cyberspace, securing the data processing infrastructure and digitising the security services infrastructure.</li></ul><p>The above-mentioned activities are expected to promote the digital transition by developing the Next Generation Access broadband infrastructure, enhancing the use of digital tools in the public sector and boosting eCompetences in society (companies, public administration, teachers and students). The plan should also contribute to optimising cybersecurity, improving data processing efficiency and upgrading the infrastructure of State services responsible for security.

This strategic document defines government actions aimed to develop the public administration using modern digital technologies and, as a result, improve the functioning of the State, while creating conditions that facilitate citizens’ communications with the public administration, and the use of information resources and shared solutions for their needs. In other words, the main objective of the PZIP is to modernise the public administration with the use of digital technologies, thus improving the efficiency of the State and the quality of the relations between the administration, citizens and other stakeholders. </p><p>Currently, the Ministry of Digital Affairs is working on a new digital transformation strategy. The document will be oriented towards the targets of the Digital Decade Policy Programme and the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) indicators. The strategy should be adopted in 2023. At the same time, the Ministry of Digital Affairs has advanced preparations and started the drafting of the National Digital Decade Strategic Roadmap with a view to submitting it to the European Commission by 9 October 2023.		</p><p class="subtitle">State Information Architecture </p><p>In 2018, the Ministry of Digital Affairs in cooperation with other institutions, created the <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-zintegrowanej-informatyzacji-panstwa">State Information Architecture</a> and entrusted it with the task to organise the IT systems and adopt a method for managing their development in accordance with the guidelines of the PZIP.</p><p>The State Information Architecture contains principles, standards, models and management processes, as well as elements necessary to implement the digital vision of the State covering legal, organisational, semantic and technical layers.

It aims to develop an ecosystem in which a large amount of good quality data will allow for the development of innovative solutions, increase the transparency of the activities of administrative bodies and increase the quality of research, accelerating scientific progress.</p><p>In 2019, a new project called Open Data Plus was inaugurated as a continuation of the project ‘Open data - Access, standard, education’. Under the project, new datasets were released through API and two new tools were established within the Ministry of Digital Affairs to support the opening of public data, i.e. the Open Data Laboratory (technical and legal advice) and the Open Data Academy (trainings). The Open Data Plus project was completed in 2022.</p><p class="subtitle">Open Data Standards </p><p>Opening public data makes public administration activities more transparent and allows civic control thereover. In 2018, the Ministry of Digital Affairs published <a href="https://dane.gov.pl/media/ckeditor/2019/07/04/open-data-good-practice-guide.pdf">guidelines</a> to prepare and share data for reuse. The guidelines concern the API standard, the security standard, the technical standard and the legal standard. The Ministry of Digital Affairs elaborated them as part of the project ‘Open data – Access, standard, education’ to ensure that data provided by the public administration would be of a higher quality. Open data may now be reused for research or business purposes. </p><p>In 2019, open data standards were subject to extensive public consultations. Most of the proposals submitted during the consultations were implemented in the new versions of the documents published in 2020. The technical standard and the API standard were also included as appendices to the Open Data Programme 2021–2027. This will trigger an increase in the quality of data provided by the administration, and used in innovative products and services.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services </h3><p><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date. </p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>In the course of 2018, Poland created a solid base for strengthening cybersecurity within the country. Then, in October 2019, the Council of Ministers adopted, by means of a resolution, the <a href="https://www.gov.pl/attachment/6a4aafc6-e339-4cd5-a8e6-cd47257f02d8">Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024</a>. The State aims to increase the level of resilience to cyber threats and protection of information in the public, military and private sectors, while promoting knowledge and good practices to enable citizens to protect information better. </p><p>The strategy defines five specific objectives that should be fulfilled by the government: </p><ul><li>Developing the national cybersecurity system (including the adoption of the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act into the Polish legal system); </li><li>Increasing the level of resilience of information systems of the public administration and private sector, and achieving the capacity to effectively prevent and respond to incidents; </li><li>Increasing the national capacity in the area of cybersecurity technology; </li><li>Raising public awareness and competences in the area of cybersecurity; and</li><li>Ensuring the Republic of Poland has a strong international position in the area of cybersecurity.</li></ul><p>The objectives are executed through a dedicated action plan that was consulted within the government in 2020. The action plan identifies mechanisms and measures to strengthen Poland’s cybersecurity capabilities by 2024. The pandemic showed that there is a need to rethink some previously proposed actions, such as addressing an increasing number of incidents inter alia in the healthcare sector. Moreover, the action plan needs to be fully in line with the actions to be implemented as part of the national Recovery and Resilience Plan (which is currently expecting to be accepted by the European Commission). </p><p>The strategy is in line with the obligations laid down in the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive with regard to the adoption of the national cybersecurity strategies by Member States. It also establishes an effective public-private partnership (Programme for Cooperation in Cybersecurity) with global and national technological companies that aims to strengthen cooperation in areas such as information sharing on incidents or vulnerabilities, education, cyber hygiene, etc.</p><h3>Interconnection of Base Registries </h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>Efficient State Strategy 2020 </p><p>According to the <a href="https://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WMP20130000136">Efficient State Strategy 2020</a>, high interoperability of all IT systems and public registers is a fundamental condition for the implementation of common standards for electronic communication in the public sector and for the provision of reference data for current office work. The possibility of automatic verification of data provided by persons using public services with reference data from public registers will allow to improve the current work of public entities, which are obliged to perform the tasks specified in the law, and at the same time will speed up the settlement of matters. It is necessary to introduce and enforce principles for limiting to the necessary minimum the range of data which will be required from the citizen when dealing with official matters. Units keeping registers must have the obligation of mutual exchange of information and direct information requests from registered entities should only be possible if the data obtained from other records are insufficient. Two-way communication between secondary and primary records (supplied directly with data obtained from the registered entities) should be provided. A modern and secure IT infrastructure, built on robust integrated tele-information systems, is now the basis for the functioning of offices and the exchange of information between offices and citizens, as well as the offices themselves and other public bodies.</p><p>The Personal Data Register (PESEL) shall be a reference set of data about citizens. Since 1 January 2022, government administration bodies, as well as law enforcement bodies, courts, organisational units of the prosecutor’s office, local government units and their bodies that keep a public register using ICT systems have to verify the data entered with the data in PESEL.</p><p class="subtitle">Reinforcement of Data Reference in Basic Registers </p><p>The formal designation of registers containing reference master data is planned in the amendment to the Act on the Digitalisation of the Activities of Entities Performing Public Tasks.</p><p class="subtitle">Recommendations for Public Administration Registers - Good architectural and legislative practices</p><p>The Ministry of Digital Affairs has developed recommendations for people designing public administration registers and the legal provisions that are the basis for the operation of these registers.

The project was implemented based on a license of Intel company at the request of the Ministry by the Poznań Supercomputing and Networking Centre (PSNC) and SDA Spółka z o.o. The aim of the pilot project was to elaborate and test solutions to develop AI competences among young people in public secondary schools as well as to promote AI-based entrepreneurship in high schools. The pilot project was implemented nationwide, with nearly 100 secondary schools (both general, IT and technical), over 120 teachers and about 2 000 students participating. As it aroused great interest among schools, teachers and students, it is expected to be scaled up in the coming years. Arousing interest among young people in prospective technological areas gives an opportunity to familiarise them with the competences of the future which the Polish labour market needs and which can be widely applied in many industries.</p><h3>Distributed Ledger Technologies </h3><p class="subtitle">Blockchain </p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/digitalization/working-group-on-dlt-and-blockchain">Working Group on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)/Blockchain</a> gathers a wide representation of blockchain market stakeholders. They are interested in ensuring adequate conditions for the development of blockchain solutions in various sectors of the economy as well as in the public sector by identifying market areas where State involvement might be both expected and necessary.</p><p>The working group serves as a platform for cross-sectoral cooperation, where different points of view, interests, as well as legal, regulatory, organisational and cultural conditions can be explored and discussed. This has already become an opportunity to expand the field of debate and support discussions of specialised financial market regulators on the Capital Market Development Strategy or fintech. An example of joint work by the fintech blockchain market stakeholders is the SIRA standardisation platform for a mobile wallet application which enables shareholders of non-public companies to manage shares registered in various banks.</p><p>Poland is also a signatory of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/blockchain-partnership#:~:text=The European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) helps avoid fragmentation of the,deployment of blockchain-based services.">European Blockchain Partnership</a> and participates in the development of the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI), a multi‑country EU project aiming at deploying an energy-efficient, privacy-enhanced and secure blockchain-based infrastructure for providing EU-wide use cases for cross‑border public services, also usable by national and local authorities, and at a later stage by private businesses. The node of the EBSI network is developed in the NASK National Research Institute. </p><h3>Big Data </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud Computing </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT) </h3><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-509.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" />Internet of Things </p><p>In August 2018, the Minister of Digital Affairs launched the Working Group for the IoT. This initiative attracted more than 150 sector experts drawn from public, business and academic circles. The working group identified key opportunities and articulated the specific role the government must play to encourage a dynamic development of the IoT in Poland. The <a href="http://www.gov.pl/web/digitalization/working-group-for-the-internet-of-things-iot">Report ‘IoT in the Polish economy</a>’ was officially launched in July 2019. Then, since January 2020, the group has been focusing on developing projects which support common use of the IoT in the following areas: (i) smart cities and smart homes/buildings; (ii) smart agriculture; (iii) healthcare system; (iv) smart transport; (v) standardisation; and (vi) legislation. Furthermore, since March 2022 the Working Group for the IoT has been working as part of the Task Team for Breakthrough Technologies established within the Council of Ministers’ Committee for Digital Affairs (<em>Komitet Rady Ministrów do spraw Cyfryzacji</em>, KRMC). The aim of current activities is to design the legal, organisational and technical framework for the dynamic development of the IoT in Poland. The ensuing recommendation should be issued by the end of 2023 as ‘Smart.PL’ programme, enabling wide deployment and usage of smart technologies in the Polish economy and society.</p><p>In order to stimulate and encourage local governments and SMEs to implement IoT solutions, the Ministry of Digital Affairs has been continuing the activities started in 2019, in particular by:</p><ul><li>Organising a series of seven conferences on the ‘Prospects for IoT Development in Poland – Self-Governments of the Future<em>’</em> in cooperation with the Ministry of Digital Affairs (January–June 2020); </li><li>Sharing a one-access-point library with information on a variety of funds available for innovative solutions; and</li><li>Encouraging local governments to contribute to the <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/mapa-innowacji">Map of Innovations in Poland</a> covering examples of the application of new technologies (IoT/AI) in local government units, scientific units and/or public administration institutions.</li></ul><p>In April 2020 a new sub-group was established called ‘IoT at the Solidarity Transport Hub Poland’. Its specific objective is to present a review of best practices and lessons to be learned from similar investments worldwide with regard to IoT use. The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/grupa-robocza-ds-internetu-rzeczy-internet-of-things-iot">report</a> (available in Polish only) was published in September 2020 and addresses key issues which should be taken into account while designing the flagship project in the field by the Polish government, so that the investment contributes to the welfare of the whole Central and Eastern Europe region.</p><h3>High-performance Computing </h3><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-517.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

This organisation, consisting of 19 members, aims to enable consolidation and use of knowledge, competencies and resources at the disposal of private enterprises, scientific units, research and development units as well as institutions surrounding the high-tech sector. The Cluster includes private enterprises, universities and scientific institutes of the Polish Academy of Sciences.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity </h3><p class="subtitle">National Broadband Plan</p><p>The <a href="https://mc.bip.gov.pl/programy-realizowane-w-mc/narodowy-plan-szerokopasmowy.html">National Broadband Plan (NBP)</a> is the basic document defining the obligations of the government of the Republic of Poland in the field of providing citizens and the economy with access to modern, fast and secure electronic communication services. On 10 March 2020, the document was updated to respond to the challenges facing Poland until 2025 and to organise the activities necessary to meet these challenges - including financial, legislative and intervention measures. The most important activities planned on the basis of the updated NBP are discussed below.</p><p class="subtitle">Connectivity and Information Projects of the Minister of Digital Affairs</p><p>The Minister of Digital Affairs conducts numerous information activities supporting the development of the network in the country, including by publishing information material on charges for using a road lane in telecommunications investments as well as guides and brochures, such as ‘Construction of telecommunications infrastructure in the road lane. A guide for road managers’ and ‘The Mega-bill and the reduction of costs of building broadband networks’. These publications concern issues related to the Act of 7 May 2010 on Supporting the Development of Telecommunications Services and Networks (the so-called Mega-bill), and the reduction of costs of building broadband networks. They were published on the website of the Ministry and widely distributed among local self-government units and telecommunications undertakings. </p><p>The activities of the Minister also include the popularisation of scientific knowledge on electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emissions. For example, the so-called ‘White paper on EMFs in relation to public health concerns’ has been published to tackle the growing tide of disinformation in that area. The Ministry is also working on a project co‑financed by the OP Digital Poland aiming to counteract disinformation in the wireless telecommunications environment and to build social acceptance for modern radiocommunication technologies. The project involves the preparation of dedicated training courses as well as information and educational materials for local governments, journalists and the general public. Broad education of selected social groups is the only effective method in the long term to combat systemic disinformation.	</p><p><img src="img/32-552.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

It grants citizens and businesses the right to contact public authorities electronically. It also sets up horizontal/infrastructure programmes for all sectors of public administration and establishes a national interoperability framework for IT systems in the Polish public sector. </p><p>This law is essential for the standardisation and interoperability of public administration systems, front- and back-office integration of public administration systems, in particular the <a href="https://epuap.gov.pl/wps/portal/english">Electronic Platform of Public Administration Services (ePUAP)</a>, the central repository of electronic document templates, and the supervision and support of IT projects in public administration at both central and local levels. Moreover, it establishes the public electronic identification (eID) scheme under which two eID means for natural persons are issued. It also enables citizens to confirm their identity or rights (e.g. for driving licenses) using a mobile device instead of documents intended for this.</p><p>The amendment in 2019 also introduced the System of State Registers as an organisational and technical tool serving public registers. The act obliges the Minister of Digital Affairs to determine technological standards for the System of State Registers, including standards for data exchange between registers. Entities managing public registers are obliged by the act to verify data which are registered for the first time with data in PESEL.</p><p>A new amendment, aimed at introducing the ‘digital by default’ principle in the way the administration operates, is under preparation and is expected to enter into force by the end of 2023. The amendment will set out common rules for public entities, including digital documents and electronic communication by default in administration and the economy (i.e. the primacy of electronic communication), the possibility of using only one means of eID (i.e. the principle of one login for every citizen and entrepreneur), the use of one gateway to public services (<a href="https://www.gov.pl/">GOV.PL</a>), solutions limiting data redundancy and data exchange of public ICT systems.</p><p class="subtitle">Act on Electronic Delivery </p><p><a id="_Hlk99958198"></a>The <a href="https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2020/2320">Act on Electronic Delivery</a> was adopted by the Parliament on 18 November 2020 and came into force on 5 October 2021 (with prolonged <em>vacatio legis</em> for some specific provisions). The aim of the act is to set up the Electronic Addresses Register together with its online services, and enable public entities to send and receive as many correspondences as possible within the administration, and with citizens and entrepreneurs by means of trust services. As a result, since 5 October 2021 people who express such a statement of will have become able to receive registered correspondence from administration institutions without having to go to the post office. eDelivery is now the legal equivalent to sending a traditional registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt or delivering it in person. </p><p>Along with the adoption of the act, the electronic delivery service standard, based upon ETSI standards, was completed. The document defines the manner of providing electronic registered delivery services by service providers, including the designated operator.

The draft law was subjected to internal consultations and interdepartmental agreements, as well as to opinions and public consultations. In 2022, it was approved by the Joint Commission of the Government and Local Government (<em>Komisja Wspólna Rządu i Samorządu Terytorialnego</em>, KWIRST) and the KRMC. The draft law was then adopted by the Council of Ministers and is currently under consideration by the Parliament.</p><p>Generally, the improvement of the mCitizen 2.0 application is coherent with the philosophy of providing eServices in Poland. The strategy of providing eServices, which Poles are very eager to use, is based on the principle of dealing with official matters with the use of a smartphone, i.e. to ensure that electronic services are available to people via mobile technologies using devices.</p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474963"></a>Regulation on the National Interoperability Framework</p><p>The <a href="https://monitorpolski.gov.pl/DU/rok/2017/pozycja/2247">Regulation on the National Interoperability Framework, Minimum Requirements for Public Registers and Information Exchange in Electronic Form, and Minimum Requirements for ICT Systems</a>, adopted on 12 April 2012 by the Council of Ministers, was further amended in 2014, 2016 and 2017. </p><p class="subtitle">Act on the Computerisation of the Operations of Entities Performing Public Tasks</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the Ministry of Digital Affairs has been working on the amendment to the <a href="http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20050640565">Act on the Computerisation of the Operations of Entities Performing Public Tasks.</a> The amended act will set out provisions related to e.g. reference data, interoperability recommendations and the interoperability repository, thus recognising the importance of the interoperability key concepts and definitions that are currently defined in the Regulation on the National Interoperability Framework.

Description automatically generated" />Act on the National Cybersecurity System </p><p>The adoption of the <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/akty-prawne">Act on the National Cybersecurity System</a>, on 5 July 2018, transposed Directive (EU) 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union (NIS Directive) into the Polish legal system. This legislation defines the national cybersecurity system, as well as the tasks and responsibilities of the entities in the system. The purpose of the national cybersecurity system is to ensure cybersecurity at national level, including the uninterrupted provision of essential services and digital services, by achieving an appropriate level of security for the information systems used to provide these services and by providing for incident handling. The act also provides for:</p><ul><li>The scope of the Polish National Cybersecurity Strategy;</li><li>The establishment of a single point of contact for cybersecurity run by the Minister competent for digitalisation;</li><li>The establishment of three Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) at national level and seven competent authorities responsible for cybersecurity within essential sectors in Poland (listed in the annex to the act). Based on the leading role of the three CSIRTs at national level (CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK and CSIRT GOV), the act also creates a coherent incident response system, with a certain and clear division of responsibilities; </li><li>The institution of the Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity, responsible for the coordination of activities and the implementation of the government policy in the field of cybersecurity; and</li><li>The addition of the public administration to the system with regard to incident handling and reporting.</li></ul><p>The government decided to maintain and develop its decentralised approach towards a governance structure of its cybersecurity system. There is a clear division of responsibilities and capabilities between all the involved institutions established pursuant to the act. That way, the act allows the creation of an efficient, comprehensive system enabling stakeholders to detect, prevent and mitigate the impact of incidents that affect Polish national interests, while contributing to crucial societal and economic activities.  </p><p>In this context, Poland has almost completed the identification and designation of operators of essential services. Also, a legal act (secondary legislation) – an Ordinance of the Minister of Digital Affairs on Organisational and Technical Conditions for Entities Providing Cybersecurity Services and the Internal Organisational Structures of Operators of Essential Services Responsible for Cybersecurity – was amended due to market needs.</p><p>In 2020, a process of amendment of the act was launched. The new amendment will come into force in the third quarter of 2023. Based on a detailed evaluation of the functioning of the Polish cybersecurity system, new measures will be introduced, inter alia (i) the information sharing mechanism will be updated by establishing Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) within the system; and (ii) the sectoral CSIRTs will be mandatory within the NIS Directive sectors. Moreover, the new law will implement measures provided for by the 5G Toolbox and ensure full alignment with the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act. </p><p class="subtitle">Act on the Protection of Personal Data </p><p>The initial Act on the Protection of Personal Data was adopted on 29 August 1997 and later amended.

The process was concluded with the adoption of the Act on Personal Data Protection of 10 May 2018, which came into force on 25 May 2018 replacing the act of 1997. The purpose of the new <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20180001000">act</a> is to ensure the application of the provisions of the GDPR.</p><p>To make the Polish regulations fully compliant, the Minister of Digital Affairs proposed amendments to 162 Polish acts. The activities – involving close cooperation with all relevant institutions, business organisations, public administrations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) – resulted in the act of 27 February 2019 amending certain acts related to the application of the General Data Protection Regulation.  </p><p>The <a href="https://www.uodo.gov.pl/">President of the Office for Personal Data Protection</a> is in charge of enforcing legislation in this field.

The implementation of the European Electronic Communications Code in Poland is achieved through the adoption of two legal acts: a new substantive act (i.e. the Law on Electronic Communications or PKE, replacing the Law of 16 July 2004 on Telecommunications) and a separate act (i.e. the Act Introducing the Law on Electronic Communications or wPKE), which includes in its scope dozens of amendments to other acts. The main part of the provisions will enter into force six months after the date of promulgation of the act.</p><p>The presentation of the proposed laws, due to their broad scope, had to be preceded by a number of substantive and legislative analyses. The drafts were the subject of a wide consultation, both with the public administration, and with consumers and entrepreneurs. The PKE and wPKE bills have now completed the government legislative process. They have been submitted for the final stage of the procedure and are currently in the parliamentary legislative process. On 13 January 2023, the first reading of the bills was held in the Parliament, after which they were referred to the Committee on Digitalisation, Innovation and Emerging Technologies for further analysis. On 6 March 2023, the Committee held a public hearing on the bills. After the completion of the parliamentary procedures and votes, the bills will be forwarded to the President of the Republic of Poland for signature. The PKE and the wPKE signature was planned in the first half of 2023.

Description automatically generated" />Artificial Intelligence Act</p><p>Poland, as a Member State of the EU, is involved in the negotiations and, currently, the trilogue process to approve the Artificial Intelligence Act. This act will be directly applicable in Polish national law and jurisdiction. As a result, no local legislative initiative in the domain of AI will be needed, except for the establishment of a local authority exclusively entitled to be the executive body to enforce AI matters locally as they will appear in the text of the Artificial Intelligence Act as finally approved. </p><p>In parallel, Poland is engaged in a negotiation process in the Council of Europe for approving the new Convention on artificial intelligence, human rights, democracy and rule of law. After ratification of the Convention, local laws could need to be completed with specific measures to ensure that the Convention is properly implemented and enforced.   </p><p>After 2023, i.e. the first short-term implementation period, Poland also plans to review the implementation of its AI Development Policy and modify it, if necessary. In addition, Poland is involved in the work of the OECD Expert Group on AI (AIGO) aimed at internationally coordinate AI policy, as well as in the work to implement the Recommendations of UNESCO on the Ethics of AI. The latter establish non-binding legal instruments, but binding provisions in local national laws could turn out be necessary to ensure their effectiveness. </p><p>Finally, Poland expects the upcoming results of the work of other international organisations (such as the World Intellectual Property Organisation in the domain of intellectual property for AI, the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law in the domain of data transactions for AI and the World Trade Organisation in the domain of digital trade for codes of AI). This input will be used by experts to conclude the drafting proposal for the negotiation process of Member States in these international organisations.</p><h3>Distributed Ledger Technologies </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Big Data </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud Computing </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT) </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity </h3><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-613.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

It is a special online account provided by the Ministry of Digital Affairs. This solution can also be used to submit a free online signature in a public service called ‘trusted signature’. This is a specific signature which includes a person’s identification data taken from an eID means which is issued under the public eID scheme. The authenticity and integrity of this signature are ensured by the Ministry of Digital Affairs, which seals signed data using an advanced electronic seal based on a qualified certificate. The trusted profile can be authenticated on the ePUAP platform. In 2022, following the armed conflict on Ukrainian territory, the possibility was launched of setting up a Trusted Profile in the process of assigning a PESEL number to Ukrainian citizens.</p><p>In 2022, over 2.3 million Trusted Profiles were created and the total number of users reached over 15.7 million. </p><p class="subtitle">Qualified Trust Service Providers under Polish Jurisdiction </p><p>Seven qualified trust service providers are active at national level in Poland: <a href="https://www.assecods.pl/">Asseco Data Systems S.A.</a>, <a href="https://www.enigma.com.pl/">Enigma Systemy Ochrony Informacji Sp. z o.o</a>., <a href="https://eurocert.pl/">Eurocert Sp. z o.o</a>., <a href="https://www.kir.pl/">Krajowa Izba Rozliczeniowa S.A.</a>, <a href="https://www.pwpw.pl/">Polska Wytwórnia Papierów Wartościowych S.A</a>., Poczta Polska S.A. and KFJ Inwestycje sp z o.o.<em> </em>The first five offer qualified electronic signatures, qualified electronic seals and qualified timestamps according to the eIDAS Regulation. One provider offers qualified validation of signatures and seals, and three others issue qualified website authentication certificates. Two providers are currently entitled to provide qualified electronic registered delivery services (Poczta Polska and KFJ Inwestycje) and Asseco Data Systems offers qualified preservation services for qualified electronic signatures. Non‑qualified trust services are also available (i.e. <a href="https://www.nccert.pl/">advanced electronic signatures and eDelivery</a>). </p><p class="subtitle">ID Card with Electronic Layer </p><p>The eID card is a secure tool containing certificates enabling electronic identification (an eID means called personal profile) and the creation of an advanced electronic signature (called personal signature). It may also contain a qualified electronic signature from a trust service provider (chosen by the holder). Moreover, the ICAO application is also implemented in the ID card.</p><p>From March 2019 to December 2022, over 10 million eID cards were issued, and more than 3.6 million people activated the electronic layer in the cards and can now use identification and authentication certificates and personal signatures.</p><p class="subtitle">National Electronic Identification Node </p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/budowa-krajowego-wezla-identyfikacji-elektronicznej">National Electronic Identification Node</a> provides convenient access to public portals and eServices. It is an organisational and technical solution that integrates IT systems at a single point in which public online services are made available, with various eID schemes (provided by public or private entities). Users using eID means issued in eID schemes connected to the National Electronic Identification Node can authenticate in any public online services. </p><p>In 2022, 511 public service providers and nine means of identification providers were connected to the node.</p><p class="subtitle">Video Chat as a Form of Identity Authentication </p><p>The first central eService in the form of a video chat was implemented in April 2020. This eService allows people to apply for a Temporary Trusted Profile (TPZ), i.e. a key to digital public administration services in Poland lasting three months, and set up an online appointment with an official without leaving home. During the audiovisual conversation, the official verifies the applicant’s identity document and accepts statements related to the application. The recording of the video-verification, which lasts for several minutes, constitutes a proof of the establishment of a TPZ. </p><p>In 2020, 37 558 TPZs were confirmed via video chat. Due to the popularity of this eService and in order to meet the expectations of citizens, in 2021 identity authentication by means of video‑verification became one of the methods to also confirm a traditional Trusted Profile, which is valid for three years. This was a significant step in the development of the Polish system of identity authentication.</p><p class="subtitle">Commercial Certification Authorities Certificates </p><p>Qualified and unqualified certification authorities (CAs) issue electronic identifiers to individual persons. These identifiers are usually Integrated Circuit Cards (ICC) with crypto-controller, private cryptographic keys and public key certificates installed inside or software-based tokens. In the case of eGovernment systems and applications, the most frequently used identifiers are the ones with qualified public key certificates.

Description automatically generated" />Implementation of the Information System on Access to Fixed Broadband Internet Services</p><p>On 1 December 2022 the Information System on Access to Fixed Broadband Internet Services (SIDUSIS) was implemented. The system is a database that collects information about the availability of fixed-line internet services on the basis of notifications from customers and internet service providers. It facilitates access to broadband internet services for consumers and enables providers of these services to adjust network expansion plans to the real needs of customers. </p><p>Furthermore, on 1 January 2023 the provisions of the Regulation on the Inventory of Telecommunications Infrastructure and Services entered into force. The inventory is public and is a source of reliable data on the coverage of telecommunications infrastructure and networks, available to all interested entities. It also provides information on the route of fibre-optic and other cable lines providing or enabling broadband internet access. The inventory allows for a significant improvement of the planning and construction of public telecommunications networks, including the rationalisation of their location by considering the route of existing networks. Entrepreneurs and local government units obtain information allowing more effective investment in the construction of telecommunications infrastructure. As a result, the availability of broadband internet access for end users increases, which in turn has a positive impact on the development of commercial and public services provided in electronic form and other IT applications in society. In addition, based on the information collected, the regulatory authority can identify areas lacking this infrastructure.</p><h3>GovTech </h3><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-700.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Services</h1><p>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad. In order to do so, Your Europe offers information on basic rights under EU law, but also on how these rights are implemented in each individual country (where information has been provided by the national authorities). Free email or telephone contact with EU assistance services, to get more personalised or detailed help and advice is also available.</p><p>Please note that, in most cases, the EU rights described in Your Europe apply to all EU member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and sometimes to Switzerland. Information on Your Europe is provided by the relevant departments of the European Commission and complemented by content provided by the authorities of every country it covers. As the website consists of two sections - one for citizens and one for businesses, both managed by DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) - below the main groups of services for each section are listed.</p><h2>Life and Travel</h2><p>For citizens, the following groups of services can be found on the website:</p><ul><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/index_en.htm">Travel</a> (e.g. Documents needed for travelling in Europe); </li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/index_en.htm">Work and retirement</a> (e.g. Unemployment and Benefits);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/index_en.htm">Vehicles</a> (e.g. Registration);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/index_en.htm">Residence formalities</a> (e.g. Elections abroad);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/education/index_en.htm">Education and youth</a> (e.g. Researchers);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/health/index_en.htm">Health</a> (e.g. Medical Treatment abroad);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/family/index_en.htm">Family</a> (e.g. Couples);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/index_en.htm">Consumers</a> (e.g. Shopping).</li></ul><h2>Doing Business</h2><p>Regarding businesses, the groups of services on the website concern:</p><ul><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/running-business/index_en.htm">Running a business</a> (e.g. Developing a business);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/taxation/index_en.htm">Taxation</a> (e.g. Business tax);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/selling-in-eu/index_en.htm">Selling in the EU</a> (e.g. Public contracts); </li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/human-resources/index_en.htm">Human Resources</a> (e.g. Employment contracts);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/index_en.htm">Product requirements</a> (e.g. Standards);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/finance-funding/index_en.htm">Financing and Funding</a> (e.g. Accounting);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/dealing-with-customers/index_en.htm">Dealing with Customers</a> (e.g. Data protection).</li></ul><p>last update:  June 2023</p><p>The Digital Public Administration Factsheets</p><p>The factsheets present an overview of the state and progress of Digital Public Administration and Interoperability within European countries.</p><p>The factsheets are published on the Joinup platform, which is a joint initiative by the Directorate General for Informatics (DG DIGIT) and the Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content &amp; Technology (DG CONNECT).

Indeed, enhanced interoperability will be necessary to unlock the potential of data use and re-use for improved public services, to enable cross-border collaboration, and to support the sector-specific policy goals set by the Commission for the future.</p><p>Interoperable Europe will lead the process of achieving these goals and creating a reinforced interoperability policy that will work for everyone.
