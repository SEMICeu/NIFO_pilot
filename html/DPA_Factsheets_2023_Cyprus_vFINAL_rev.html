The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-85.x-emf" alt="32-85.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Cyprus in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-98.x-emf" alt="32-98.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Cyprus’ results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for several Principles such as Principle 4 (Reusability) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). In addition, the implementation of the recommendations relating to principle 3 (Transparency) and principle 10 (Administrative simplification) led to an increase in Cyprus' score from 3 to 4 in 2022. However, the areas for improvement are concentrated on Principle 1 (subsidiarity and proportionality), where the score of 3 is below the EU average as well as on Principle 9, where the score went from 4 to 3 in 2022. More specifically, Cyprus should further ensure that national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies are aligned with the EIF and, if needed, tailor and extend them to address the national context and needs (i.e. Recommendation 1) and should further use information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (i.e. Recommendation 16).</p><p><img src="img/32-109.x-emf" alt="32-109.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Cypriot results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance with only scores of 4 in line with the European average. The very good implementation of the recommendations for the legal interoperability layer led Cyprus to get the score from 1 to 4 in 2022. As regards areas for improvement, Cyprus could focus on interoperability governance. In particular, the consultation of relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and European level, in accordance with your NIF and relevant DIFs, when acquiring and developing ICT solutions (i.e. Recommendations 23) and the active participation in standardisation work relevant to your needs to ensure your requirements are met (i.e. Recommendation 24) could be a priority. However, it should be noted that the score of 2 and 1 respectively does not affect the final score of the layer.</p><p><img src="img/32-119.x-emf" alt="32-119.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Cyprus’ scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an overall good performance in the implementation of all recommendations, aligned with the European average. The implementation of the recommendations of the conceptual model and catalogues leads to a score above the EU average in 2022. In terms of areas for improvement, Cyprus could further use external information sources and services while developing European public services (External information sources and services – Recommendation 45) as well as use trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (Security and Privacy – Recommendation 47).</p><p><img src="img/32-131.x-emf" alt="32-131.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Cyrpus concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at least upper-middle performance of the country in 16 indicators. However, Cyprus has still margin for improvement in relation to three indicators where the country obtains a low performance. For instance, efforts could focus on the simplification of processes and use digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users’ requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens (i.e. Recommendation 17) and on the development of a shared infrastructure of reusable services and information sources that can be used by all public administrations (i.e. Recommendation 36).</p><p>Additional information on Cyprus’ results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="img/32-143.png" alt="32-143.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc140671481"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Digital Strategy 2020–2025</p><p>A new holistic <a href="https://www.dmrid.gov.cy/dmrid/research.nsf/planning01_el/planning01_el?OpenDocument">Digital Strategy 2020–2025</a> has been elaborated and is at execution stage, the Council of Ministers and the Minister of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy (DMRID) being the competent executive bodies for its deployment.

Description automatically generated" />Public Administration Reform </p><p>In January 2022, the Cyprus Parliament launched a Public Administration Reform (PAR) and approved a set of legislative acts introducing in the public service: (i) a new performance appraisal system for assessing employees’ performance; and (ii) a new system of appraisal and selection of candidates for filling the promotion posts in the public service from the year 2024 onwards. With this recent reform, all the appraisal criteria are prescribed with corresponding weights, in order to ensure meritocracy, objectivity and fairness. New criteria have also been introduced (e.g. assessment centres) to ensure that candidates are evaluated based on modern methods and exercises, to verify their skills and competencies, and to eventually select the most suitable candidates. The legislation on the new performance appraisal system, starting from the annual evaluation for the year 2023, provides a framework for the performance appraisal of the employees based on criteria and detailed framework of competencies and skills in line with their hierarchical level.</p><p>Moreover, regulating teleworking and other flexible working arrangements was deemed imperative in the framework of modernising the functioning of the public service and taking into account the challenges for the public service during the Covid-19 pandemic. A reform called ‘Regulating flexible working arrangements in the public sector’ has been included in the Cyprus Recovery and Resilience Plan 2021–2026 to ensure better levels of productivity and effectiveness, a reduction in absenteeism and sick leaves and the improvement of employees’ satisfaction. This reform is expected to be concluded by the end of 2024.</p><p class="subtitle">Operational Programme ‘Competitiveness and Sustainable Development’ </p><p><a id="_Toc1474959"></a><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>The promotion of ICT use is one of the seven priority axes of the 2014–2020 operational programme (OP) ‘<a href="http://www.dgepcd.gov.cy/dgepcd/dgepcd.nsf/page09_en/page09_en?OpenDocument">Competitiveness and Sustainable Development’</a>.

Following the publication of the Cyprus National Cybersecurity Strategy in 2013 and the NIS Directive in 2016, the National Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) was created in November 2017, providing advanced cyber-incident response services to a range of constituents within Cyprus, and has become very active both on the national and European levels when it comes to incident response and technical crisis coordination. Among other services, CSIRT-CY offers proactive services, e.g., alerts and warnings to the local and international community and reactive services, e.g., incident management in cases of a cyber incident.  CSIRT-CY has also developed a number of incident response and contingency plans that cover the response to incidents, significant incidents and cyber crises at a national level. These form the backbone of Cyprus’ response to such incidents, and CSIRT-CY is actively contributing to related European efforts in this area, especially through its contributions to the CSIRTs Network. In just a couple of years of operation, CSIRT-CY managed to become an Accredited Trusted Introducer Team (TI Accredited team since June 2018), a full member of the FIRST community (since April 2018) and voluntarily and successfully passed the ENISA CSIRT Maturity Assessment in 2019, achieving the Advanced Level.</p><p>As part of its mandate, the DSA (Digital Security Authority) has published secondary legislation covering a whole security measure framework (including controls) for application by critical operators, incident notification obligations and processes, and the registration of digital service providers. The framework can also be used by organisations and businesses that are not critical per se, but are nevertheless important, as they are based on international best practices. More recently, the DSA has also been given the mandate to act as the National Cybersecurity Certification Authority, in order to fully implement the provisions of the EU Cybersecurity Act at national level. To this end, the DSA is already participating in two co-funded projects which are specifically designed to build up the cybersecurity certification capabilities of Cyprus. Finally, the DSA has been given a new mandate to act as the National Coordination Centre for Cybersecurity Competence.</p><p>The activities for the year 2022 were: </p><ul><li>The publication and implementation of a comprehensive audit framework for all operators of essential services and critical information infrastructures; </li><li>The development of operational cybersecurity certification capabilities;</li><li>The development of a capability maturity model for Operators of Essential Services and Critical Information Infrastructures; and</li><li>The expansion of the national CSIRT-CY (proactively extending the offer for services).</li></ul><p class="subtitle">National Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>The updated <a href="https://dsa.cy/en/">National Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Cyprus</a> was published in December 2020. It includes a number of thematic areas (25 actions) and adopts a holistic approach covering all dimensions of cybersecurity (identification, protection, detection, response, recovery, improvement). The document identifies specific targets for each of the thematic areas, and specific project plans have been developed for each action, with many of the actions already being implemented. The timeline under consideration for the implementation of the totality of the actions and for a new update to the strategy, extends until the end of 2024. The strategy is a self-standing initiative, although it has taken into account massively the current version of the national Digital Agenda.</p><p>In Cyprus, there has always been a strong link between the operational and the strategic dimensions of cybersecurity, through the organisation, structure and operations of the Digital Security Authority (DSA). The National CSIRT is now part of the DSA, which was established in April 2018.</p><p>The DSA acts as the NIS Competent Authority for all sectors under the NIS Directive and as the Single Point of Contact and it also incorporates the National CSIRT-CY. In concrete terms, regulatory measures are developed, their application is supervised by the DSA, incident reports are received and analysed, and the DSA closes any gap between the strategic, regulatory and operational side through updates to regulatory measures and the monitoring of the national cybersecurity status.  In addition, the DSA is actively collaborating with a range of national public and private stakeholders in the area of cyber and industrial policy, to ensure that maximum benefits are attained through the implementation of the national cybersecurity strategy.</p><p>The budget that has been made available for the implementation of the strategy is currently around EUR 6.5 million for 2022, although the Steering Committee of the strategy is following a dynamic approach and can request additional budget each year depending on the needs identified (any further budget needs will be identified and allocated for 2023 and 2024).</p><p>Moreover, the Cyprus Computer Society (CCS) in collaboration with public services and other organisations is coordinating the Cyprus Cyber Security Challenge (CCSC). The competition takes place annually and addresses young cybersecurity talents aged 14 to 25 years old.

Description automatically generated" />eGovernment in Education</p><p>In November 2020, the Ministry of Education, Sport and Youth announced a tender for the provision, implementation, maintenance and operation of an Integrated School Management System (SMS). The SMS will contribute to the streamlining of bureaucracy, the reduction of high administrative costs and it will ensure the prompt provision of information, cooperation and support of various stakeholders. </p><p>On the 6th September 2022, the contract for the implementation of the system was signed.<a id="_Ref499827768"></a><a id="_Ref35638017"></a> More specifically the contract scope includes:</p><ul><li>The provision of implementation services, including the development, implementation and testing of the functionalities of the Integrated School Management System and other peripheral systems (such as data migration activities and the training of the required resources) as well as users training;<a id="_Ref35630617"></a></li><li>The provision of data centre infrastructure and server infrastructure hosting services for the primary site (full production site) and disaster recovery; and<a id="_Ref499751099"></a></li><li>The provision of maintenance services and the operation of the Integrated School Management System. Help desk services will be provided during the same period.</li></ul><p>Within the Cyprus Recovery and Resilience Facility there is a total allocation of EUR 24 million for interventions aiming at enhancing the digital skills of the whole population. These activities fall are under Policy Axes 5.1 and 5.2. Moreover, additional funds are allocated from other European Funds, such as the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and other relevant national funds. Notably, the designed actions under each funding instrument are complementary among each other, so as to avoid overlaps and of course double funding.</p><p>As to the measures included in the national RRP under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education, Sport and Youth, the aim is to equip with laptops, projectors, microphones, speakers, and digital graphic boards the classrooms in at least 700 schools by June 2023. Additional digital tools will be available to develop and apply students’ digital skills in everyday teaching and learning. Moreover, the connectivity networks of schools were upgraded. By December 2024 curricula will be transformed and educational material for digital skills and STEM methodology will be produced for 120 school subjects, and by June 2026 at least 3 375 primary and secondary teachers will have benefitted from in-service training and professional development on digital competences. The overall cost is estimated at EUR 13.8 million.</p><p class="subtitle">National Digital Skills Action Plan 2021–2025</p><p>The <a href="https://www.dmrid.gov.cy/dmrid/research.nsf/planning_el/planning_el?OpenDocument">National Digital Skills Action Plan 2021–2025</a> (available in Greek only), approved by the Council of Ministers in December 2021, is currently under implementation. Within the action plan there are various measures to be implemented with the collaboration of all stakeholders. Notably, the approval of the action plan was the first milestone of the intervention included by the DMRID under the national RRP. The action plan serves as an umbrella and horizontal document, which takes into account other sector specific strategies such as the lifelong learning strategy developed by the Ministry of Education and the National Cybersecurity Strategy developed by the Digital Security Authority. The action plan contains all relevant interventions at national level included in the RRP and amounting to EUR 24 million. They are distributed as follows:</p><ul><li>General population: interventions implemented mostly by the Cyprus Productivity Center (CPC);</li><li>Workforce in the public sector (implemented by the DMRID and the Cyprus Academy of Public Administration) and private sectors (Human Resources Development Authority, HRDA);</li><li>ICT experts: same as above; and</li><li>Educational system, implemented by the Ministry of Education.</li></ul><p>The intervention of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurances implemented by the HRDA and the CPC aims at offering skilling, reskilling and upskilling for 11 500 participants with an estimated cost of EUR 15 million, of which EUR 8.79 million are earmarked for digital skills programmes . The HDRA trainings will focus on the employed and the unemployed while the CPC will focus on two target groups, namely: (i) digital skills for all, thus addressing the general population of all ages and other demographics (leaving no one behind); and (ii) people over 55 years old, thus covering specific needs and for example designing the activities in consultation with associations representing the elderly, etc. Other targeted programmes are being designed to cover the needs of specific population groups, such as people with disabilities and people living in remote areas.</p><p>Notably, the Deputy Ministry has established collaborations through Memorandums of Understanding with Amazon Web Services, the Government Digital Service of the United Kingdom, and the Agency for Economic Cooperation and Development of the Austrian government. This cooperation on an international level can prove very beneficial for a small country like Cyprus as it offers various channels to seek for guidance and best practices. These collaborations are not limited to creating a knowledgeable workforce, but also provide support for digital government and infrastructure projects, as well as for SMEs competitiveness.   </p><p>Another important tool that will provide a holistic coordination mechanism is the national coalition for digital skills and jobs which we are ready to launch it by the end of 2023 and in which numerous organizations from the public private sector and academia participate. The delivery mechanism of this coalition is the national platform for digital skills and jobs under the CEF agreement and in connection with the core platform, serving also as a forum for networking and exchange of best practices. The platform will include an index of available training opportunities from all coalition members, a self-assessment tool to assess the digital skills of citizens and produce suggestions on upgrading opportunities from the list of trainings, as well as eLearning material. The finalization of the platform is still pending due to the various technical requirements as per the CEF agreement which are being addressed in order to officially launch the platform.</p><p>The implementation of the National eSkills Action Plan is responsibility of a Governance Committee chaired by the DMRID, and composed by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Labour (HRDA, CPC), CAPA, CITEA, and the CCS. Meetings are held every three months and on ad-hoc basis (depending on the issue).</p><p>As to raising awareness and promoting the STEM culture, government funding is provided for  student participation in ICT/STEM international competitions, (e.g. Junior Achievement, Robotex etc), common events focusing on the digital area organised by the DMRID and the Research and Innovation Foundation (e.g. European Researchers Night, INNOVA Challenge etc), and continuous government and industry support of initiatives targeting girls and women (e.g. ACM womENcourage 2022, Girls in Stem Academy).</p><p>As to the public sector, under the ESF+ the Cyprus Academy for Public Administration is implementing a series of training programmes on digital skills, from basic to advanced level, based on the identification of needs through a dedicated survey that was carried out in cooperation with the Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy. The survey resulted in the identification of more than 13 000 training needs at 90 public organizations in the fields of MS Office, cybersecurity, social media, teleworking and eLearning tools, eCollaboration and productivity tools. For the identified period, more than 3 000 civil servants participated in trainings which will be offered regularly until the end of 2023. The basic training on cybersecurity will begin during 2023 with an estimated participation of 2 500 public sector employees. </p><p>As to the general public, the Cyprus Productivity Centre is implementing various training programmes under the national RRP addressed to the general public and people over the age of 55 in the areas of: computer skills, use of smart devices, use of eGovernment systems and services, MS Office, digital skills for health and wellbeing. For the general public training programmes deal with: MS Office (basic to advanced), cybersecurity, digital marketing, eLearning and teleworking tools, among others. Specifically, for 2022 more than 70 training programmes took place with more than 800 participants, while in the period 2023–2025 more than 450 training programmes are estimated to take place. Currently, the effort is to design additional courses funded by the DMRID in consultation with social partners and targeting vulnerable groups such as people in remote areas and people with disabilities. The Cyprus Productivity Center has already put in place a number of promotional interventions, using various channels, such as online and printed media, social media etc. More intense promotion is being designed in the context of the National Digital Skills Action Plan which provides for a holistic communications plan. </p><p>The Human Resource Development Authority is also implementing training activities for digital skills (2019 – Q1 2022: more than 675 programmes for employed with more than 5 500 participants, the majority being men; 2019 – Q1 2022: 127 programmes for unemployed with more than 300 participants, the majority being women). The HRDA has included in RRP 2021–2026 a specific intervention for the skilling, reskilling and upskilling for digital skills, while other actions are included in THALIA 2021–2027.</p><p>The establishment of the DMRID in March 2020 and the appointment of one single authority with horizontal responsibility and a coordinating role among all public and private stakeholders has been one of the best practices so far and has proven very beneficial, as it guarantees alignment and synergies between all implementing bodies, as well as better use of resources. Excellent collaboration has also been established with the private sector, which is actively contributing to the success of the governmental efforts. The recent survey amongst CITEA members contributes significantly not only to designing courses with real impact that respond to the true needs of the market, but also to engaging and raising awareness amongst ICT enterprises on the skilling, reskilling and upskilling opportunities for their staff.</p><p>On 29 November 2022, the Structured Dialogue on Digital Education and Skills with Cyprus took place between the European Commission (EC) and the Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy (DMRID). The DMRID invited all relevant stakeholders to participate in the structured dialogue and exchange views with the EC. The participants were from the Ministry of Education, Sport and Youth, the Ministry of Labour and Social insurance, the Human Resources Development Authority (HRDA), the Cyprus Productivity Centre (CPC), the Cyprus Academy of Public Administration (CAPA), the Cyprus Information Technology Enterprises Association (CITEA), the Cyprus Computer Society (CCS), and the Tech Island. </p><p class="subtitle">Reform of the Justice System (eJustice)</p><p>The reform introduces qualitative changes to the justice system with the goal of strengthening the flexibility, effectiveness, and speed of the decision-making process. As part of the reform, an electronic court administration system will be introduced to digitalise the operations of the different courts. To this end, a tender to purchase a license for a web-based court administration system (eJustice system) was launched, including the training of personnel, and the option to acquire the system by the government. The eJustice system will be installed in the premises of every court in Cyprus, and it will be possible to manage all procedures of a legal case. Additionally, the eJustice system will provide electronic services to court personnel, law offices, police, governmental departments, private law companies, lawyers, the bar association, private companies, citizens and private service provides (e.g. audit firms, land development companies, certifying officers etc.). Notably, that eJustice will include functionalities covering the provisions of the new Civil Procedure Rules as well as the new Courts which were created by the Justice Reform.</p><p>The implementation phase is expected to be completed by July 2023, followed by a two-month pilot phase. Upon successful completion of the pilot phase, an SLA agreement will be activated, and the system will be deployed for production. The production phase will last six years and the government will pay a monthly fee as a license to use. This monthly fee will also cover the helpdesk, maintenance and small-scale changes and improvements of the system. The government has the right to extend the production phase for an additional four years or to purchase the system.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Innovative technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle">National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence</p><p>Strengthening the Cyprus Digital Industry is a main pillar of the New Industrial Strategy which, among others, aims to enhance adoption and use of sectors such as cloud, big data and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, it aims to increase the adoption rate of digital production systems and applications, to create smart factories and incorporate cutting-edge technologies and digital services infrastructures, thus reinforcing Cyprus’ transition to Industry 4.0. Within the New Industrial Strategy, the Service of Industry and Technology (in the Ministry of Energy, Commerce and Industry) maintains a State-aid subsidy scheme (funding support measures) providing financial support for the digital enhancement and upscaling of SMEs. The scheme’s total subsidy budget for the period 2021–2027 amounts to EUR 30 million, equally allocated to three calls for proposals scheduled respectively in  Q4 of 2022, Q1 of 2023, and Q3 of 2024. </p><p>The first call for proposals was completed (December 2022) with 365 applications (for EUR 10 million) and had a high impact in stimulating awareness (creating the market), facilitating and promoting SMEs’ investment towards digital transformation. The scheme focuses on - but is not limited to - the Digital economy and society index (DESI) dimension for promoting the integration of digital technology by enterprises with special focus on the aforementioned digital technologies (cloud, big data, AI). Through specific selection and evaluation criteria, the scheme gives special emphasis to the promotion and the implementation of advanced digital technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Blockchain, cloud computing and big data. Additional actions include the development of the implementation plan for the National Artificial Intelligence Strategy of Cyprus, called Action plan for harnessing and developing AI in Cyprus 2021–2025.</p><p>Τhe Council of Ministers in Cyprus approved the <a href="https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/cyprus_ai_strategy.pdf">National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> in January 2020. The strategy is based on four key pillars set by the European Commission, namely to maximise investment through partnerships, to create national databases, to nurture talents and lifelong learning, and to develop ethical and trustworthy AI. In May 2021, an updated national strategy was introduced, and a specific action plan was prepared, with a timeframe of implementation extending until 2026.</p><ul><li><em>Human Capital</em>: focused on improvements to the <strong>education in AI</strong>.

The ad-hoc working group will also define a national plan for the development of blockchain technology in Cyprus. The plan, which will be submitted to the Council of Ministers for approval, will include pilot projects, legislative initiatives and a strategy for the adoption of blockchain.</p><p>Cyprus participates in the European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) and the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI). The Council of Ministers during its session held on 18 June 2019 approved the National Strategy for Decentralized Technologies-Blockchain.</p><p>In 2021, Cyprus was among the few early adopters of the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) with its participation to a two-year project started in May 2021 and aiming at the development of a fully operational national EBSI Infrastructure under the Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy (DMRID). The infrastructure is implemented in collaboration with academia and enterprises. As part of the project, a Diploma Blockchain Use Case and wallet will be developed. In March 2023, the Cyprus Deputy Ministry of Innovation Research and Digital Policy completed the evaluation of a tender called "Extending the existing use case of authentication of digital diplomas/credentials (e-diploma) to the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI) national hub" and is working on the awarding of the contract and the signing of the project agreement. In March 2023, in reply to an EC Call for expression of interest in EDICs, Cyprus submitted its proposal and manifested its interest for a European blockchain services infrastructure EDIC.</p><h3>Big Data</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud Computing</h3><p>G-Cloud</p><p>Cyprus aims to create a unified cloud environment that will provide Cloud Computing capabilities for the government by hosting Governmental Systems and Services. The G-Cloud will be implemented in the premises of a datacentre provider (Tier3 datacentre) and not in government premises. Initially, the G-Cloud will be used by a limited number of Departments and Ministries of the government, but it will be continuously improved and extended in order to cover most of the existing Systems or other upcoming needs. In parallel, the G-cloud will be expanded to become a hybrid cloud, allowing the use of public cloud resources when suitable. The project is at the initial phase and it is getting prepared for the procurement phase. The estimated date for the completion of the implementation is foreseen at the end of 2025.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing</h3><p class="subtitle">Participation in the EuroHPC JU – National HPC Competence Centre </p><p>The Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy (DMRID) has been participating in the EuroHPC JU since July 2019. It has appointed members to its governing board and is co-funding the operation of the national HPC competence centre (NCC) with EUR 2 million for the two-year period 2020–22 under the EuroCC project. The NCC is coordinated by the Computation-based Science and Technology Research Centre (CaSToRC) of the Cyprus Institute. The role of the NCC is to provide technical support and promote HPC for research and commercial use. The EuroCC project was successfully carried out by CaSToRC and the second implementation round (EuroCC2) will cover the period between 2023–2025, also with a EUR 2 million budget, co-funded once again by the DMRID (source ESIF 2021–2027). The focus of EuroCC2 is once more to provide technical support to the Cyprus computational community, with special focus to the areas of training and industry.</p><p>Furthermore, in 2022 Professor Constantia Alexandrou and Stelios Erotokritou, both of CaSToRC, were appointed as PRACE Council Chair and Secretary respectively, for a two-year term. They are working together with other PRACE colleagues to best define the future role of PRACE in the European HPC Ecosystem, and how PRACE can work in a collaborative and complementary manner with EuroHPC.</p><h3><a id="_Hlk93997665"></a>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle">Cyprus National Broadband Plan 2021–2025</p><p>Broadband coverage has generally been improving across Cyprus and has met the 2020 target for ubiquitous 30 Mbps coverage, but not all EU targets for 2020 were achieved. Suburban and rural areas, where there are less incentives for the private sector to invest in ultrafast broadband provision, remain uncovered in comparison with urban areas, and ultrafast take-up is significantly behind target.</p><p>The Department of Electronic Communications of the DMRID announced the Broadband <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/broadband-cyprus">Plan of Cyprus 2021–2025</a> in November 2021. The new Broadband Plan focuses on expanding ultra-high-speed networks coverage and demand by using EU funding and other State aid resources. It is a roadmap that aims to strengthen and develop new infrastructure, technologies and connectivity services. The plan includes a set of interventions at legislative and regulatory level, but also actions of practical support for the development of broadband infrastructure, and sets the following connectivity targets, to be achieved by 2025:</p><ul><li>Gigabit connectivity for all main socio-economic drivers;</li><li>All premises in organised communities (urban or rural) to have access to internet connectivity offering a download speed of at least 100 Mbps, upgradable to 1 Gbps;</li><li>100% of the population living in organized communities (urban or rural), and all major terrestrial transport paths to have uninterrupted 5G coverage with a download speed of at least 100 Mbps; and</li><li>70% of households to have an internet connection (take-up) with a download speed of at least 100 Mbps.</li><li><strong>Investment 1 -</strong>Expansion of Very High-Capacity Networks (VHCN) in Underserved Areas</li><li>This investment aims to accelerate the deployment of VHCN infrastructures in underserved areas through public intervention, with the aim to ensure that: (i) all premises in organized urban and rural communities have access to 100-Mbps download speed, upgradable to 1 Gbps; (ii) the entire population living in urban and rural communities, as well as all major terrestrial transport paths have uninterrupted 5G coverage with download speeds of at least 100 Mbps; and (iii) all main socio-economic drivers (SED) have access to symmetrical Gigabit connectivity. It was decided that target (ii) will not to be implemented, since a public consultation was carried out that showed that the mobile investment was not necessary.</li><li>The scheme consists in organising a public open tender procedure to select up to three telecom operators that shall undertake the design, construction and operation of the network in the three different areas (lots) identified in the tender. In order to preserve competition, one single operator cannot win more than two lots. As a result of the public support, it is expected that based on the RRF milestones at least 44 000 premises in underserved areas will be covered by VHCN connectivity networks. The total budget allocated to the scheme will be of EUR 35 million and will finance investments throughout 2022–2025.</li><li><strong>Investment 2</strong> - Gigabit Connectivity</li><li>The providers have been successful in migrating a significant number of clients from low speeds to offers of at least 100 Mbps. Still, despite the good fiber coverage, the take up of Gigabit speeds in Cyprus is significantly below the EU average. To address this issue, and following the pilot voucher scheme in 2019, the Department of Electronic Communications has recently announced a new investment scheme to incentivise the take up of gigabit connectivity. In line with the Cyprus Recovery and Resilience Plan, the Government of Cyprus has set up a voucher scheme that aims to support households to connect to VHCN. The direct beneficiaries and end users of the scheme are households in selected areas of Cyprus which can offer speed services of at least 200 Mbps under peak time conditions. Households can then freely choose a subscription with any eligible operator. The total budget allocated to the scheme will be EUR 10 million expected to benefit approximately 82 000 households. The intervention scheme will run from 2023 to 2025.</li></ul><h3>GovTech</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><p><img src="img/32-205.png" alt="32-205.png" /></p><p>3</p><p>Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><h1><a id="_Toc140671482"></a>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474962"></a>Specific Legislation on Digital Public Administration</h2><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474963"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474964"></a>Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle">Access to Public Information (Access Rights Act)</p><p>In December 2017, the Law providing for the right of <a href="http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/enop/non-ind/2017_1_184/index.html">Access to Public Sector Information (Law 184(Ι)/2017)</a> was adopted and entered into force in 2020, for the purpose of enhancing transparency within the public sector.

Description automatically generated" />National Platforms and Applications</h3><p class="subtitle">Gov.cy</p><p>A new <a href="https://www.gov.cy/gr/">Gov.cy</a> portal went live in June 2022. The new front-end is more modern and promotes a unified identity and online presence of the Cypriot government and provides better digital services to citizens and businesses. It is a modern, user-friendly, dynamic and responsive web page where the public has access to all digital services provided by the Cypriot government and also to other portals that provide digital services. The commissioning has been successfully completed. This new portal has integrated Ariadni in order to benefit fully from its current functionalities and mechanisms. It is the single point of communication between the public and the Cypriot government, in order to serve the citizens in a more user-centric approach. The project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) 2021–2027.</p><p class="subtitle">Point of Single Contact of Cyprus</p><p>The <a href="https://www.businessincyprus.gov.cy/about-us/#:~:text=Point of Single Contact (PSC) Cyprus&amp;text=The PSC Cyprus portal, https,the services sector of Cyprus.">Point of Single Contact (PSC)</a> provides services to businesses and entrepreneurs, whether in Cyprus or in other EU Member States, interested in pursuing their business aspirations in the services sector of Cyprus. </p><p>The PSC’s online portal (<a href="https://www.businessincyprus.gov.cy/about-us/">PSC Cyprus | Business Information &amp; Services | businessincyprus.gov.cy</a>) was designed and implemented in accordance with Directive 2006/123/EC and Regulation (EU) 2018/1724, whose specific guidelines refer to the provision of comprehensive information, friendly navigation and easy access to assistance services relating to the procedures and formalities required for accessing and exercising regulated services’ activities and professions in the country. </p><p>Easy online submission of applications is also supported, for a limited number of procedures (nine procedures), with the goal of expanding this number further in 2023 in cooperation with the Competent Authorities and Digital Services Factory of Cyprus. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital One Stop Shop (DOSS)</p><p>The overall objective of the project of the Ministry of Energy, Commerce &amp; Industry is the development of two action plans, whose successful implementation will lead to the establishment of a <a href="https://www.eprocurement.gov.cy/epps/cft/prepareViewCfTWS.do?resourceId=5384223">Digital One Stop Shop (DOSS).</a> This digitalisation will enable the streamlining of the procedures for Renewable Energy Sources (RES) permits (in line with the provisions of Article 16 of Directive 2018/2001/EC), thus facilitating the energy renovation process in buildings by bringing together stakeholders such as applicants, investors, developers, and relevant authorities, and offering one contact point for the entire process (in line with the provisions of Directive 2018/844/EU of the energy performance of buildings - EPBD). </p><p>The simplification, integration and digitalisation of the licensing and permitting process will help remove the barriers and encourage investments in large scale RES projects. Similarly, it is envisaged that the streamlining of the renovation process and the transformation of a complex set of multiple-actor decisions into a single point of contact and customer-centric services has the potential of bridging the gap between the fragmented demand and supply in the renovation value chain, thus providing the incentives to property owners to undertake renovation projects.</p><p class="subtitle">Government Secure Gateway (Ariadni)</p><p>The <a href="https://cge.cyprus.gov.cy/">Government Gateway Ariadni</a> is the foundation for the delivery of the vision of a joined-up government and will ultimately constitute the central passage to all electronic transactions between citizens, businesses, institutions and the government. In terms of functionality, it incorporates a unified registration and authentication service, allowing users (citizens, businesses, institutions, etc.) to conduct their transactions with the relevant government organisations over the internet in a secure manner, with a single set of credentials, using any application, any device, anytime, anywhere. Additionally, Ariadni provides interoperable, secure and authenticated web-based interconnection of back-end systems. The project has been classified as one of the most important infrastructure projects for the successful implementation of eGovernment. Common core services provided through Ariadni include:</p><ul><li>Common user identity management/authentication and authorization;</li><li>Single sign-on credentials – CY Login;</li><li>Common messaging facility;</li><li>Online payments; </li><li>eSigning Broker, and</li><li>Integration tier, offering reliable, standards-based information exchange between systems.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Reform of the Government Presence</p><p>A strategic study for the reform of the government’s web presence on the Internet was carried out in collaboration with the Structural Reform Support Service of the European Commission (SRSS) and concluded in 2019. As a result, a new project is underway for the reform of the way in which the government validates and publishes information on the Internet through websites. The aim is to improve efficiency and productivity in all areas, enabling faster and easier development, hosting and publishing, as well as to provide a more user-friendly environment for the employees of government organizations who are in charge of the administration of their websites (upload information/update content). It will be a continuation of the GovCy portal (Interim) as a Single Point of Access to all Government websites.

Thus, eOASIS serves as a records management system.</p><p>Following the positive findings of a cost-benefit analysis and a comparative study between different software platforms and eOASIS, the eGovernment Board has approved the rollout of eOASIS to all the remaining government organisations. The system currently operates in 57 government organisations and serves around 9 000 users. Specifically, 53 organizations operate in a central technical infrastructure (‘cloud-style’ manner) and the rest (namely the Cyprus Police, the House of Representatives, the Cyprus Intelligence Service and the Deputy Ministry of Tourism) operate on their own infrastructure. </p><p>The deployment of eOASIS has been planned in two phases. Phase I was completed by 2022 and catered for 15 governmental organisations. Phase II concerns approximately 7 000 more users and will cover the remaining needs of the public sector. eOASIS is constantly upgraded with functional additions and technical/architectural upgrades and redesigns.

MECI is currently working on: (i) the digitalization of the registries of all independent experts’ and installers related to energy efficiency and renewable energy; and (ii) on the development of a Digital One-Stop-Shop to streamline the issuance of RES projects permits (single point of contact for permitting of RES projects) as well as to facilitate Energy Renovation of Buildings.</p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p>Involvement in the European Blockchain Partnership </p><p>Cyprus has been actively participating in the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/blockchain-partnership#:~:text=The European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) helps avoid fragmentation of the,deployment of blockchain-based services.">European Blockchain Partnership</a> (EBP) and the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) since 2018. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.cysec.gov.cy/en-GB/home/">Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (CySEC) has been operating an innovation hub since 2018, promoting DLT/blockchain in the financial sector. In addition, a regulatory sandbox project was included in Cyprus’s Resilience and Recovery Plan. Cyprus is among the few early adopters of the EBSI: it is currently implementing a CEF-funded project whose aim is to establish a fully operational national EBSI Infrastructure and develop a cross-border Diploma Blockchain Use Case and wallet. The project has been showcased repeatedly to other EBSI European projects.</p><h3>Big Data</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud Computing</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle">Broadband Infrastructure Objectives</p><p>The Government of Cyprus achieved the first target of 100% coverage of the country with broadband infrastructure, using <strong>DSL broadband network</strong>, installed by the incumbent telecommunications operator offering a speed of at least 30 Mbps.</p><p>Cyprus has already included in the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) a series of investments and reforms and is also planning to submit proposals in other digital infrastructure tools in the next programme period. An important part of the new broadband plan is to expand the Very High-Capacity Networks (VHCN) infrastructure by using EU funding and focusing on digitally excluded, rural and suburban areas. At the same time, the socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, research and business centres, universities, ports, and other underserved areas with limited speed internet access, located throughout the country, will be connected to symmetric gigabit speeds.</p><p>Another major measure is a voucher scheme which aims to enhance cabling, in order to be “Gigabit-ready” and promote connectivity take-up. The voucher will support households to connect to very high-capacity networks (VHCN) by offering a reduction to the setup costs and a subsidy to cover the first twelve months of subscription. This measure is based on a pilot voucher scheme which was launched in 2019 and successfully increased the very low take-up of very high-capacity connections by subsidising broadband connections of at least 100Mbps.</p><h3>GovTech</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><p><img src="img/32-277.png" alt="32-277.png" /></p><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p><h1><a id="_Toc140671484"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on Cyprus’ responsible bodies for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-cyprus">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2>National </h2><p class="subtitle">Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy</p><p>The Cyprus government decided to create the profile of a <a href="https://www.dmrid.gov.cy/dmrid/research.nsf/home_en/home_en?opendocument">Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digital Policy (DMRID)</a> tasked with the central coordination of all activities concerning research, innovation and digital policy.
