The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-309.png" alt="35-309.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Lithuania in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-324.jpeg" alt="35-324.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Lithuania’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 7 (Inclusion and accessibility) and 9 (Multilingualism), for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the use of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies aligned with the EIF (Principle 1 – Recommendation 1), the implementation of e-accessibility specifications that are widely recognised (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14), and the inclusion of  multilingualism support on information systems (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p><img src="img/35-334.jpeg" alt="35-334.jpeg" /></p><p>The Lithuanian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall good performance. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance and semantic interoperability. More specifically, the score of 1 for Lithuania in Recommendations 21, 23 and 24, all referring to the need to have process and catalogues for standards and work standardisation, lowers the overall governance interoperability result for Lithuania.</p><p><img src="img/35-348.jpeg" alt="35-348.jpeg" /></p><p>Lithuania’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model, internal and external information sources and services,performing above the European average in the latter , base registries and open data. However, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to catalogues as well as in the area of security and privacy. Precisely, the lack of trust services according to the Regulation on eID (Security and Privacy - Recommendation 47) hinders the overall Lithuanian score on the security and privacy area.</p><p>Additional information on Lithuania’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1035577"></a><a id="_Toc1474948"></a>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2020-egovernment-works-people">eGovernment Benchmark Report</a>, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity:</strong> indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services:</strong> indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers:</strong> indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

Appropriate legislation was passed, responsible institutions were selected to manage various aspects of security (electronic information security, cyber security, personal data security etc.) and military and civilian responsibilities were apportioned. However, after several years of operation of said legal and institutional system, Lithuanian authorities concluded that the functions of the Country’s institutions responsible for cyber and electronic security overlapped and that public sector financial resources and cyber security personnel were deployed inefficiently. </p><p>The Lithuanian government decided to consolidate all cyber responsibilities under the <a href="https://kam.lt/en/title.html">Ministry of National Defence</a> in order to create a single window for everyone, to ensure the sharing of Lithuania’s cyber experience with others and, finally, to strive for the best solution regarding civil-military synergies in cyber security. In order to finally consolidate the management of cyber security and electronic security, amendments to the Law on Cyber Security and the Law on Management of State Information Resources were made and adopted on 21 November 2017. The Ministry of National Defence took on the leadership role for Lithuania’s overall cyber and electronic security from the beginning of 2018. A unified <a href="https://www.cert.lt/en/">National Cybersecurity Centre</a> became the main computer emergency response team (CERT) that brings together the Lithuanian public, private, governmental and military spheres. </p><p>In 2019, the Ministry of National Defence established a Governmental Network, detached from a public internet and encompassing State institutions having functions related to mobilisation. This will ensure that even in the event of a conflict, fundamental State institutions will remain protected and able to exchange information. In addition to national initiatives, Lithuania, represented by the Ministry of National Defence, is a lead nation of the EU’s Permanent Structured Cooperation in Security and Defence Project Cyber Rapid Response Teams and Mutual Assistance in Cyber Security. Together with eleven other EU Member States, Lithuania is creating a common capability to respond to cyber-attacks – a multinational team with a well-developed cyber toolkit, which will be able to support Member States in times of need.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474981"></a>Subnational (federal, regional and local)</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474982"></a>Policy</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474983"></a>Counties and Municipal Authorities</p><p>The strategic responsibility for eGovernment at the regional and local levels lies with each individual county and municipal authority.</p><h3>Coordination</h3><p class="subtitle">Counties and Municipal Authorities</p><p>Regional and local eGovernment initiatives are coordinated by each individual county and municipal authority.

ESPBI IS was created as a single data centre which stores the medical records of each resident (patient) and also allows integrating data from all internal Information Systems (IS) of healthcare institutions into a unified system. Such integration allows for the creation, storage and transfer of EHRs according to the “one patient one EHR” principle. For the smaller healthcare institutions that do not own internal IS, a special eHealth portal was developed. Authorised healthcare professionals can now provide the required patient data to the central EHR database or other ESPBI IS databases of through their computers. This means that patient data can be transferred to ESPBI IS either directly via a special eHealth portal or by integrating the internal IS of larger healthcare institutions.</p><p>Since mid 2017, the number of electronic medical records, including electronic prescriptions, has grown significantly. All the health care providers that have contracts with the Health Insurance Fund are connected to the central eHealth system – ESPBI IS. These healthcare providers serve more than 95% of Lithuania’s patients. All pharmacies are connected to the central eHealth system and can dispense medicines based on electronic prescriptions.  In December 2020, the increase of the ESPBI IS usage was significant – the ESPBI IS served 100% of insured patients who are registered with a primary health care institution that has a contract with Health Insurance Fund, 99.7% of all reimbursed drugs were prescribed electronically, 100% referrals, 95% in-patient recuperation, 100% outpatient descriptions, 100% child's birth certificates and medical death certificates, 93% driver's medical certificates, were provided to the ESPBI IS. </p><p>The data stored in ESPBI IS is also accessible to patients via special national <a href="http://www.esveikata.lt/">internet portal</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Social Support and Family Information System</p><p>The <a href="https://www.spis.lt/">Social Support Family Information System (SPIS)</a> is an information system operating under cooperation agreements between the Ministry of Social Security and Labour and all the country’s municipalities.
