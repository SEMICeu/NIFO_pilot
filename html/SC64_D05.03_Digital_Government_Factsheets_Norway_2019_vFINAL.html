It regulates the type of entities to be registered and the information to be recorded, the relationship with the affiliated registries, the notifications to the registry, the registration, the inspection of messages, and the exchange and disclosure of information. Private businesses have access to public information through the commercial distributor.  </p><p class="subtitle">Land registry</p><p>The <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dokumenter/act-land-registration/id455461/">Law on Land Registration </a> and the <a href="https://lovdata.no/dokument/NL/lov/2005-06-17-101">Law on the Cadastre </a> regulate the operation of the Land Registry and the Cadastre.

The second law regulates the maintenance, access, collection and the processing of data, public fees, sanctions and fines related to the Cadastre. Although no former definition exists regarding land registry, the Law on the Cadastre defines the cadastre as “the country's official registry of the real estate property, residential buildings and addresses”.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474968"></a>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">Public Procurement Act</p><p>Norway notified the full implementation of Directives <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0017:EN:HTML">2004/17/EC</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0018:EN:HTML">2004/18/EC</a> of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 which state that in view of new developments in information and telecommunications technology and the simplification that these can bring in terms of publicising contracts, and the efficiency and transparency of procurement procedures, electronic means should be put on a par with traditional means of communication and information exchange. </p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing Legislation</p><p>B2B eInvoicing is mandatory for central government entities in Norway since 2011.

Nordic Innovation, an instrument under the Nordic Council of Ministers, founded the project, which is an official inter-governmental body for cooperation in the Nordic region. SmartGovernment aims to create a platform for transactional reporting of business data for small and medium businesses in order to reduce, or even eliminate the need for reporting and facilitate B2B use of information. During <a href="https://nordicsmartgovernment.org/">the 2018-2020 period</a> the project focusses on interoperability, automated flow of data, rules for exchange of business data, and communication and stakeholder engagement. The success of SmartGovernent solutions depends on extensive access to base registries.</p><p>Last but not least, the tax authorities of Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden operate the <a href="https://www.nordisketax.net/">Nordisk eTax</a>, a portal in collaboration with the Nordic Council of Ministers. The Nordisk eTax addresses people who live in a Nordic country but have income or assets in another Nordic country.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">KOSTRA</p><p>The Municipality-State-Reporting <a href="http://www.ssb.no/kostra/">KOSTRA</a> system allows municipalities and county municipalities to report electronically to the State data on the economy, schools, health, culture, the environment, social services, public housing, technical services and transport, and communication. KOSTRA focuses on two main purposes: provide better information about the municipalities at central and local government level; and strive for more efficient reporting. </p><p class="subtitle">National Register</p><p>Information on everyone living in Norway is gathered for tax, electoral and population analyses by local tax assessment offices. This information is registered in the <a href="http://www.skatteetaten.no/en/Person/National-Registry/">National Register</a> (<em>Folkeregisteret</em>) and is overseen by the Directorate of Taxes (S<em>kattedirektoratet</em>). Information from the National Register (e.g. names, addresses, citizenship, identification numbers, employment and civil status of individuals) is only accessible by authorised public sector offices. However, members of the public may apply for access to information from the National Registry for legal purposes. Applications for information from the National Registry are processed by local tax assessment offices and the Office of the National Registrar. </p><p class="subtitle">Altinn</p><p>A common technical platform, called Altinn, was created for the public sector to exchange data from base registries with the purposes of prefilling digital forms, reporting to the public sector and for lookup-services in the base registries, e.g. the National Registry and the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities. Altinn contains an authorisation module that governs access to services by the role of individuals and businesses. The businesses roles, e.g. director, board members, accountant, are managed in theEntity Registry. The Norwegian Entity Registry (or Central Coordination Register for Legal Entities, CCR) contains information about both businesses and public entities (understood as governmental agencies). A new registry, currently under development within the Brønnøysund Registry Centre, will add authorisation by proxy. This will furthermore extend the authorisation component in Altinn. The authorisation component also manages sharing of data with user's consent.</p><h1><a id="_Toc12874820"></a>Digital Government Services for Citizens </h1><p>The information in this section presents an overview of the basic public services provided to the citizens.
