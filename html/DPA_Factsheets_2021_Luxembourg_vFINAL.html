Luxembourg has a higher performance in the implementation of Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), Principle 9 (Multilingualism) and Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) in comparison with the EU average. More specifically, Luxembourg scores high in the alignment of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies with the EIF (Principle 1 – Recommendation 01), the use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16) and the evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits (Principle 12 – Recommendation 19). The area of improvement of Luxembourg with regard to Scoreboard 1 is located in Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) for which a higher accessibility of public services by all, in line with commonly agreed e-accessibility specifications would allow the country to reach a maximum score of 4 in this Principle.</p><p> <img src="img/35-317.jpeg" alt="35-317.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Luxembourg’s results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 highlight an overall very good performance.

The goal is promoting transversal digital accessibility, developing user-centred services, offering attractive online public services and investing in citizens' trust in online State services.</p><p>Furthermore, the strategy analyses the essential conditions for the central public administration so as to enable it to respond effectively to the needs of society. The overarching objectives in the digital context are to facilitate the transition to an efficient paperless administration and to have an IT environment conducive to new ways of working. In addition, the strategy underlines the importance of being able to rely on a central IT partner who is competent, agile and reliable. To this aim, the CTIE aims to strengthen its digitalisation services, develop cutting-edge infrastructures and further guarantee very high levels of security and reliability.</p><p>The Governing Council also mandated the inter-ministerial Committee for Digitalisation to coordinate the implementation of this strategy.</p><p class="subtitle">Einfach Lëtzebuerg</p><p>The government has been committed to administrative reform and simplification for several years now and much progress has already been made, notably under the programme <a href="https://fonction-publique.public.lu/fr/plus/actualites/articles-actualites/2017/04/20170403_Einfach-Letzebuerg.html"><em>Einfach Lëtzebuerg</em></a>. However, the simplification of administrative formalities and procedures is continually evolving. Drawing on technological advances in particular, the programme aims to provide a simple and predictable framework for citizens and companies in their relations with the State. Any new project, legislation, procedure or adaptation of existing ones, when deemed necessary, need to be respectively considered or reconsidered in light of the ‘digital’ component.</p><p>The digitalisation and simplification of State administrations must proceed in parallel to reach the desired outcome and all ministries and administrations have concrete digitalisation projects on their agenda. Therefore, there is a need to consolidate and amalgamate efforts to provide Luxembourg with an exemplary administration that will contribute to its economic attractiveness. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital Lëtzebuerg </p><p><a href="https://digital-luxembourg.public.lu/">Digital Luxembourg</a> considers that IT has become both a vital sector of the economy and an important influence factor in all socio-economic sectors, which makes it an essential component of the government's policy of rationalisation, efficiency, modernisation and ‘doing more with less’. Therefore, in October 2014 the government decided to reinforce and consolidate Luxembourg's position as an IT and high-tech centre of excellence and as an open and connected society, starting with a coherent and generalised strategic framework. Digital Luxembourg enables and supports new and existing projects that address the country’s needs and fuel positive transformation. It establishes solid financial foundations for innovation, providing for the teaching and training of new competences, and helping to create new markets (big data, smart grids, health IT, financial technology, virtual currencies) for Luxembourg's rapidly growing IT sector. Digital Luxembourg strives to make them successful by facilitating public partnerships, securing funding and boosting visibility. To maximise its impact, the strategy is applied horizontally throughout the different sectors and is a key component of every political decision. The Digital Luxembourg Strategy is implemented by various ministries for the domains that fall under their responsibility and is coordinated by the Department for Media, Telecommunications and Digital Policy. The strategy is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework, which is part of Luxembourg general political goals. </p><p class="subtitle">Strategic Vision for Artificial Intelligence and Data-Driven Innovation Strategy</p><p><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>On 24 May 2019, Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister and Minister for Communications and Media, and Etienne Schneider, Deputy Prime Minister, presented the <a href="https://gouvernement.lu/fr/publications/rapport-etude-analyse/minist-economie/intelligence-artificielle/data-driven-innovation.html">Strategic Vision for Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a>, which includes political guidelines applying both to AI and the ongoing digitisation of key economic sectors. The objective is to support the emergence of a sustainable and reliable national economy. The development of a strategic vision for AI represents a national priority for Luxembourg. The Strategic Vision for AI implements detailed actions and engages citizens on their attitude towards AI. The document identifies three goals for Luxembourg: </p><ul><li>Becoming one of the most digitally advanced societies in the world, in particular within the European Union;</li><li>Establishing Luxembourg as a sustainable, data-driven economy; and</li><li>Supporting the development of AI with a human-centred approach.</li></ul><p>At State level, Luxembourg's Strategic Vision for AI led to the creation of the <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr/dossiers/2021/AI4Gov.html">AI4Gov Inter-ministerial Committee</a>, made up of representatives of the Ministry for Digitalisation, the Media and Communications Service (SMC), and the Information and Press Service (SIP). To promote the use of AI within the public administration, the AI4Gov committee launched two call for projects for experimentation projects in AI and data science, in November 2019 and December 2020 respectively, addressed to public actors. In addition to providing technical support for projects, the AI4Gov committee also provides legal and ethical support through the creation, at the beginning of 2020, of an inter-ministerial working group called ‘AI Legal &amp; Ethics Working Group’. This group is made up of the Ministry for Digitalisation, the Department of Media, Telecommunications and Digital Policy, the Government Information and Press Service and the High Commission for National Protection. Through the support of AI4Gov projects and dialogue with project leaders, this working group carries out a preliminary assessment of the legal and ethical risks associated with the projects, thus laying the groundwork for the approach to AI governance in the sector. </p><p>On 20 November 2020, the government undertook an additional step in the pursuing of the national Strategic Vision for AI by launching a public consultation on the perception of AI among the population and societal actors.</p><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>On 8 December 2020, the Minister Delegate for Digitalisation signed the <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites.gouvernement+fr+actualites+toutes_actualites+communiques+2020+12-decembre+08-berlin-hansen.html">Berlin Declaration</a> on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government.

One of the ministry's strategic axes is the development of eGovernment, and the GovTech Lab constitutes an integral part of the actions that the ministry is implementing in this area. The GovTech Lab combines GovTech and open innovation in order to accelerate the development and further improvement of digital public services. </p><p>The GovTech Lab, which is the result of a cooperation between the Ministry for Digitalisation and its technological arm, the Government IT Centre (CTIE), sets out to encourage and support a culture of innovation and change within the State in order to rethink existing procedures and operational flows and integrate principles such as digital by default, design thinking or service by design when conceiving new solutions. For its calls for solutions, the Ministry for Digitalisation has opted to make the widest possible use of the innovation partnership, which allows a broader participation of external players thanks to a more open public procurement procedure which is articulated in different phases.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a><a id="_Toc30683936"></a><a id="_Toc30683929"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">Luxembourg National Interoperability Framework</p><p>The <a href="https://digital.gouvernement.lu/en/dossiers/2019/NIF-2019.html">Luxembourg National Interoperability Framework (NIF)</a> was adopted on 1 March 2019.

This strategy had two key objectives: </p><ul><li>Preparing young people for work in a complex and constantly changing environment (under the ‘digital for education’ umbrella); and</li><li>Promoting new learning strategies, software, and innovating educational projects (under the ‘digital for education’ umbrella).</li></ul><p>One of the initiated projects was the introduction of free computing classes for young Luxembourgers through the launch of ‘makerspaces’ at secondary schools during the 2015/2016 school year. The makerspaces were open to the schools which hosted them, as well as to other schools, after-school clubs, youth clubs, parents and associations. There are currently more than 20 makerspaces. Another pilot scheme aims to introduce the use of tablet devices in five secondary schools for students’ daily activities.</p><p>Other projects under the Digital (4) Education Strategy include: (i) training teaching staff and offering access to digital teaching resources as part of <a href="http://info.edusphere.lu/">eduSphere</a>; (ii) introducing a maths-teaching software (for cycle 4) to be used at home and at school as part of <a href="http://www.mathematic.lu/">MathemaTIC</a>; and (iii) <a href="http://portal.education.lu/dcl">Digital Classroom Lëtzebuerg</a>, providing comprehensive computer literacy training and enabling students to better manage their lives through digital tools. Further projects include makerspaces in schools, FutureHub labels for schools committed to new technologies and an online teaching/learning platform.</p><p>Since January 2020, the Minister for Education, Children and Youth introduced coding in all mathematics classes throughout cycle four and five of the basic educational programme. The development of digital skills, particularly coding and computational thinking, is now seen as a fundamental precondition for schools wishing to effectively prepare young people for the careers of tomorrow, which will continuously require more and more digital skills. Thus, digital, computational and coding skills will systematically be taught throughout the primary and secondary education programmes in public schools. As part of the Code Week 2020, the Ministry of Education organised coding workshops with high schools and primary schools. In that context, a ‘matchmaker’ platform was setup with the contribution of Digital Luxembourg, allowing teachers who want to organize coding workshops and need experienced assistance to register for an appointment with information technology (IT) volunteers. </p><p class="subtitle">Einfach Digital</p><p>In February 2020, the government presented <a href="https://men.public.lu/fr/publications/dossiers-presse/2019-2020/einfach-digital.html">Einfach Digital</a>, a new approach to digitalisation in the classroom focused on critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration and coding. Einfach Digital represents the next generation in the Ministry of Education’s digitalisation approach, thus replacing the <a href="http://portal.education.lu/digital4education/">Digital (4) Education Strategy</a>.

The electronic signature must also ensure the signatory is identified and show the latter's obvious consent to the content of the deed”, and 2) an eSignature “supported by a qualified certificate, which must be created with a secure signature creation device under the sole control of the subscriber”.</p><p>Certification service providers can only issue certificates with the approval of the National Accreditation and Supervision Authority. Approved (qualified) certificates are valid for a maximum duration of three years and must be archived by the certification service provider for at least 10 years. The certification providers also have to undergo periodic external security audits.</p><p>eSignatures supported by a qualified certificate have the same legal validity as handwritten signatures, and the eCommerce act rendered void all laws and regulations that challenged the validity of a contract on the grounds that it was signed electronically.</p><p>The act's primary importance resided in the recognition of eSignatures and eContracts. Unlike the directive it was based on, it did not use the term ‘advanced’ eSignature but rather recognised a ‘qualified’ level of eSignature. It also differs from the directive and similar legislation in other Member States, insofar as it legally recognised electronic wills and electronic deeds and implemented the customer's right to withdraw from an electronic contract within seven days of its creation, free of questions and penalties, with full reimbursement of any money paid to the seller.</p><p>The act closely followed the directive in terms of information requirements from seller to customer, the seller's obligation to acknowledge reception of an order, the rules governing the liability and confidentiality requirements for certificate issuers (domestic and foreign), and provisions concerning the auditing and accreditation of certificate issuers.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474966"></a><a id="_Toc30683943"></a>Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle">EU General Data Protection Regulation </p><p>In May 2018, the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/">EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>  entered into force in the whole EU and therefore also in <a href="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2018/08/01/a686/jo">Luxembourg</a>.
