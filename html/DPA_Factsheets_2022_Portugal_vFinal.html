The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Portugal in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-257.x-emf" alt="35-257.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Portugal’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Areas of improvements are concentrated in Principle 9 (Multilingualism) for which the score of 2 shows a medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. In particular, Portugal should focus its efforts on improving and fostering the use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16). Another area of improvement for Portugal should be Principle 3 (Transparency) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Particularly, the degree of internal visibility and provision of external interfaces for European public services (Principle 3 – Recommendation 5) are partial and could be bettered to reach the European average of 4. </p><p><img src="img/35-270.x-emf" alt="35-270.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Portuguese results for the implementation of the interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance with scores of 3 and 4. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of legal interoperability and semantic interoperability. More specifically, the score of 1 for Portugal in Recommendation 30, declaring that data and information should be perceived as a public asset that should be appropriately generated, collected, managed, shared, protected and preserved lowers the overall implementation of semantic interoperability in Portugal.</p><p><img src="img/35-287.x-emf" alt="35-287.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Portugal’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an overall good performance in the implementation of recommendations with scores of 3 and 4, and above the European average for the area of Security and Privacy. One area of improvement could be in the implementation of the recommendations related to open data. Precisely, by publishing open data in machine-readable, non-proprietary formats and ensuring that open data is accompanied by high quality, machine-readable metadata in non-proprietary formats, and fostering the use of common vocabularies for expressing metadata (Open data – Recommendation 42) could be further improved to better the overall Portuguese score on Open Data, and on Scoreboard 3 in general.</p><p>Additional information on Portugal’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play  </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

It is based on three structuring dimensions: resilience, climate change and digital transition.</p><p>In what regards digital transition, the aim is to ensure that Portugal accelerates the transition to a more digital society. For that purpose, significant reforms and investments are planned in the following areas: empowerment and digital inclusion of people through education; training in digital skills and promotion of digital literacy; digital transformation of the business sector; and digitalisation of the State. The measures to support digital objectives represent 22% of the total allocation of the plan, exceeding the threshold of 20% set by European regulation: 12 of the 20 components of the Plan have a direct contribution to achieve the digital agenda.</p><p class="subtitle">SIMPLEX Programme </p><p><a href="https://www.simplex.gov.pt/">SIMPLEX</a> is the Portuguese flagship simplification and modernisation programme. It follows a citizen-driven approach and has a strong focus on co-creation, with the ultimate goal of simplifying as much as possible citizens and businesses’ everyday life, as well as their interaction with the public administration. SIMPLEX pursues in one single governmental programme the objectives of better regulation, administrative burden reduction, service interoperability, digitisation, red tape reduction and digital government promotion.</p><p>The responsibility for the programme lies with the Secretary of State for Digitalisation and Administrative Modernisation, under the Prime Minister and with the technical support of the Administrative Modernisation Agency. Furthermore, SIMPLEX includes a Focal Point Network, consisting of representatives of the various Ministries.</p><p>The programme is highly inclusive and innovative, involving citizens, entrepreneurs and public servants in determining and designing the initiatives to be implemented by the public administration. Participants are offered channels for their involvement through the organisation of nationwide meetings and brainstorming design sessions, ‘Start-up SIMPLEX’ competitions and the SIMPLEX website.</p><p>Overall, SIMPLEX has already launched over 1 600 simplification measures. </p><p>SIMPLEX has proven to be a successful and replicable model, with an average annual execution rate exceeding 90% (2016-2021) and a positive feedback from the programme’s stakeholders. In 2019, an Ernst &amp; Young evaluation, commissioned by the European Commission in coordination with the Portuguese government, analysed the impact of 40 measures of SIMPLEX 2016 and 2017, concluding that they represented a yearly net saving of EUR 170.1 million and 15 million working hours, plus a potential additional benefit for the economy corresponding to EUR 89 million.

It provides both informational and transactional services, in line with the citizen-driven approach that the Portuguese government has been implementing for the last few years. Additionally, the portal integrates the <a href="https://eportugal.gov.pt/inicio/espaco-empresa/balcao-do-empreendedor">Entrepreneur’s Desk</a>, which is the single point of contact for digital services related to the exercise of economic activity. </p><p>The ePortugal Portal is dynamic and adaptable to individual users: it offers a Reserved Area where users can check information regarding their relationship with the public administration and access a documents folder, in which they can save and share files with other registered users or with public entities. Likewise, ePortugal provides innovative support instruments such as the <a href="https://digiplace.sharepoint.com/sites/WE-EUROPEANCOMMISSION-ABCIVSC263NIFO/Shared Documents/D04.01 Digital Government factsheets and infographics/Country factsheets 2020/Portugal/mapa.eportugal.gov.pt">Citizen Map</a> (available as an app, for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.ama.mapadocidadao&amp;hl=pt_PT">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/mapa-de-cidadÃ£o/id966526205">iOS</a>), which provides georeferenced information for all public services and digital queue tickets for onsite public services, and the AI-powered chatbot SIGMA, that helps users to find and use the available services and allows to request a contact with one of the available helplines for citizens and entrepreneurs.</p><p>In 2021, ePortugal continued to evolve and integrate new areas related to services and information provided, in line with the Single Digital Gateway Regulation. The part of the portal dedicated to business activities has been expanded, integrating new information and services, and a new section with information for migrants living in Portugal has been added.  </p><p>Following the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the relevance of ePortugal has increased, as it became the preferential means to access online public procedures, thus reducing demand for in-person services and preventing the gathering of crowds in public spaces.  </p><p class="subtitle">COVID-19 Public Information: EstamosOn</p><p>On 18 March 2020, the central administration launched <a href="http://www.covid19estamoson.gov.pt">EstamosOn</a> as the single point of contact for all relevant information on the COVID-19 prevention and containment measures. This national platform, directed to citizens, families and companies, offers:</p><ul><li>Communication campaigns to encourage the use of digital public services, promoting the ePortugal Portal as a way to minimize social contact;</li><li>Technological tools (and related tutorials) to make telework possible and facilitate the pursuit of day-to-day activities;</li><li>A list of the exceptional measures adopted by each governance area, as well as political communications and relevant legislation (accompanied by FAQs);</li><li>A dashboard with the epidemiological evolution in Portugal;</li><li>A section with questions collected from social networks and answered by the competent health authorities; and</li><li>A complete, consolidated and reliable list of emergency and support contacts created by the various public services.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Open Data (Dados.gov+)</p><p>Following international practices in the area (e.g. the US or the UK Data.Gov projects), AMA has committed to the development of a wide and open platform containing all kinds of data from public bodies. The objective of this policy - keeping in mind the right of any citizen to consult public administration information - is to facilitate citizens’ access to public open data. As a result, the <a href="https://dados.gov.pt/en/">Open Data Portal</a> makes available to citizens an extensive range of information from very diverse areas.</p><p>The Dados.gov web-portal was relaunched in May 2018 as Dados.gov+, replacing its previous 2012 version. Developed under the SIMPLEX+ Programme, this new version was designed to conform to the best international practices in the field and incorporate innovative solutions in terms of user experience, content structure, data integration and user licenses. </p><p>Managed by AMA and available in open source, Dados.gov+ is based on the French UDATA platform, which was developed by ETALAB, and which already has more than 4 900 datasets. It is free and open to all users that want to access data, but also to citizens and organisations that wish to make available data of public interest. All they need to do is to register, receive their application programming interface (API) key and characterise the dataset they wish to upload. Each dataset can have more than one associated resource and can be published in different and multiple formats, which is one of the features enabling data reuse. It is also possible to index datasets by introducing an URL referring to the origin of the data, which is ideal for entities that already have the information available in their own platforms, like the partilha.justiça.gov.pt from the Ministry of Justice or the <em>Lisboa Aberta</em> portal from the Lisbon City Hall. In case the supplying entity already possesses its own data portal, the publishing process can also be made through data harvest, thus collecting data regularly and automatically.</p><p class="subtitle">Participa.gov</p><p><a href="https://participa.gov.pt/base/home">Participa.gov</a> is a centralised platform that supports all of Public Administration’s participatory processes (e.g. participatory budgets), be it open to the general population or restricted to the public sector (nationwide or local processes). End-users can participate in open calls by submitting their own proposals and/or by voting on their preferred ones, making use of secure authentication and voting mechanisms, namely the national eID mechanisms (recognized by the European eIDAS Regulation with the highest level of assurance) and blockchain technology, guaranteeing transparency, security and anonymity in the voting process and avoiding possible fraud.</p><p class="subtitle">Recuperar Portugal</p><p>This <a href="https://recuperarportugal.gov.pt/?lang=en">portal</a> was developed to manage, monitor and execute the national RRP. It presents relevant statistics in this regard, namely the volume of contracts signed between ‘Recuperar Portugal’ and the entities responsible for the implementation of investments with the Plan funds.</p><p class="subtitle">Transparency Plus</p><p>Launched in April 2021, “<a href="https://transparencia.gov.pt/">Transparency Plus</a>" is a digital platform that allows citizens to access easy-to-read information on public resources and policies. The portal kicked off with an area dedicated to European funding, which provides real-time, accessible information on the progress of measures and projects financed or co-financed by European funds, related to NextGenerationEU and the Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027.</p><p>The portal also focuses on municipalities, encompassing 5 areas of analysis: economic dynamics, financial management, administrative management, tax decisions and decentralization of competences. For each of these areas, a set of reference indicators is presented to provide a global picture for the 308 municipalities.</p><p>The involvement of citizens with special needs in the design and testing of the platform allowed improvements to be incorporated, guaranteeing accessibility for all citizens. The portal was awarded the golden badge for accessibility and usability, the highest standards of compliance with best practices in this field.</p><p class="subtitle">Web Accessibility and Usability Ecosystem  </p><p>AMA is responsible for developing, promoting and monitoring the implementation of usability and accessibility guidelines and regulations, ensuring compliance with national and international standards and best practices (namely EN301549 and WCAG 2.1 from W3C) and enabling citizens, especially those with disabilities, to access and use public services online.</p><p>To this end, AMA made available an ecosystem, aggregated in the <a href="https://www.acessibilidade.gov.pt/">acessibilidade.gov.pt</a> web portal, with information about laws, guidelines and best practices, as well as practical online tools for public entities, which include:</p><ul><li>An accessibility and usability kit for public sector’s websites (with all resources available on <a href="https://github.com/amagovpt/Usabilidade-Gov-PT">Github</a>); </li><li>An accessibility WCAG 2.1 validator;</li><li>An accessibility statement generator; </li><li>An Observatory of Digital Accessibility; and</li><li>A usability and accessibility seal of excellence.</li></ul><p>The <a href="https://selo.usabilidade.gov.pt/">Usability and Accessibility Seal</a>, in particular, is an indicator of the quality of the contents and services made available online by public and private entities, according to three levels of compliance with standard requirements: bronze seal (lowest level of conformity, i.e. to level 1 requirements), silver seal (intermediate level of conformity) and gold seal (highest level of conformity).

On the web portal, users can consult their tax files and statistics and conduct simulations. In addition, a complimentary app was made available in 2018 to facilitate the payment of taxes and the consultation of the citizen’s fiscal status.   </p><p>Advanced functionalities were recently integrated into the system allowing for enhanced usability, the most notable being the automated income tax declaration. The pre-filling of the declaration already began several years ago, culminating in the current fully automated procedure, in which the personal income tax can be settled without any intervention by the taxpayer. Developed as a SIMPLEX measure, this feature automatically prefills the citizen’s income statement with all relevant data conforming to data protection regulations. Then, the declaration receipts and the notification of the final tax calculation can be confirmed electronically. </p><p class="subtitle">National Health System </p><p>The <a href="https://www.sns.gov.pt/">National Health System (NHS) Portal</a> provides citizens with online access to a wide range of information and services, including a Transparency section centralising the data produced by health care entities and making it available for reuse without any restrictions. Additionally, the omnichannel solution SNS24 provides the following tools:</p><ul><li>SNS24 Portal – allows, among other functions, for the consultation/download of health information and access to georeferenced information about health providers;</li><li>SNS24 app (mHealth) – allows the access to and the portability of health information and services by citizens;</li><li>SNS24 telephone hotline – single point of contact which provides citizens with a set of information and services that facilitate access, ensure equity and simplify the use of the NHS; and</li><li>SNS24 Balcão (‘SNS24 Counter’) – physical counter to facilitate citizens’ access to the various digital services of the NHS, in partnership with municipalities.</li></ul><p>Once logged into the SNS24, citizens and health professionals have direct access to RSE – the Portuguese Electronic Health Records (EHR) platform, which aims to facilitate the sharing of information between citizens, health professionals and public health entities.

The Portuguese Social Security has been strongly investing in a digital transformation strategy, to respond to the needs of citizens and economic agents, and providing them with a simple, inclusive, intuitive and transparent experience, in self-service mode, with total convenience and autonomy. To this end, the Direct Social Security Portal currently offers over 250 digital services, including the possibility to request pensions and social benefits, consult and update information on a citizen’s contribution history and obtain an integrated overview of all credits and debits. In the portal, employers and independent workers may also find the main services that allow them to fulfil their obligations to Social Security.

In addition, all operations are supported by the national eID mechanisms, namely the PIN-protected Citizen Card and the Digital Mobile Key, thus strengthening the citizens’ trust in digital services.</p><p>The combination of public digital services with the onsite assistance of a specialised mediator, in a hybrid model of service delivery, has proven to be an effective way to engage citizens in the use of digital services. It makes everyone more aware of the available services and their respective benefits, and also of online security, which is fundamental to boost public confidence in the use of ICTs in general. </p><p>As of March 2022, there were 799 spots located in town halls, parishes or public libraries throughout the country (aiming to be close to citizens of all backgrounds) and also in the cities of São Paulo (Brazil), Paris (France), Brussels (Belgium) and London (UK), providing more than 50 services, in a base catalogue of 13 entities, with nearly 8,2 million attendances. </p><p>The Citizen Spot concept was extended with the launch of (i) the Solidarity Citizen Spot, which specifically targets day-care centres, nursing homes and residential structures for the elderly, and includes the operation of mobile kits by a trained mediator; and (ii) the Mobile Citizen Spot, which foresees the use of minivans to provide digital assistance in remote locations or catastrophic situations.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Interoperability Platform of the Public Administration</p><p>The <a href="http://www.iap.gov.pt/">Interoperability Platform of the Public Administration (iAP) </a>is a service-oriented central platform that aims to make available to all public administrations a shared tool that allows multichannel services for citizens and enterprises.

Since December 2017, citizens can also use a Digital Mobile Key app for receiving the one-time password associated with each authentication through push notifications on their smartphones. More recently, in April 2018, the Digital Mobile Key was upgraded with a remote qualified signature feature, according to the eIDAS Regulation.</p><p>The main objective is to offer a complementary authentication solution through mobile devices, safer than access via username and password (ensuring more security to the State) and simpler for the citizen (ensuring more effectiveness and efficiency for citizens and companies). As of March 2021, more than 2.4 million citizens have already been enrolled in the Digital Mobile Key system.</p><p>The eID scheme concerning the Digital Mobile Key was published in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2020:116:FULL">OJEU 2020/C 116/01</a> with a ‘high’ Level of Assurance.  </p><p class="subtitle">ID.gov.pt</p><p>The <a href="https://id.gov.pt/">ID.gov.pt</a> app is a digital wallet available for iOS and Android that allows citizens to view, save and share certified versions of personal identification documents, including the national ID card (Citizen Card), the driver’s licence and the vehicle registration document, among others.

The main component is a Cloudera Cluster running on Linux over commodity hardware.</p><p>This toolset allows for the development of efficient pipelines for the ingestion, processing and sharing of large volumes of very heterogeneous data within a short time to market. The ingested data consist mostly of application and system logs, data obtained by querying business databases and instrumentation tools, along with a few more unusual sources. The result is a near real-time update of a few hundred system indicators (and some business performance ones).</p><p class="subtitle">Social Security – Data Quality and Business Intelligence</p><p>The big data platform adopted for infrastructure monitoring, with a few additional software components (e.g. Sqoop and Spark job), is also the foundation on which some business intelligence jobs are built. These business intelligence jobs are oriented to data quality (consolidation of data with more than a single source of truth) and fraud detection.</p><p>This toolset allows Social Security to deliver, in a matter of minutes or hours, information and insights that might take days to calculate using more traditional tools. Without this toolset, the output of these jobs would be, in most cases, outdated at birth.</p><h3>Cloud computing </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.  </p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.  </p><h3>High-performance computing</h3><p class="subtitle">Social Security - Service Edge</p><p>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed to improve response times and save bandwidth. Social Security is adopting this new concept to accelerate the internal services in the network edge and support working from home for a large number of remote users who adopt Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) technology to get secure access to the services and applications with the best user experience and highest security.</p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle">Gigabit network</p><p>In order to ensure coverage of all households, in the national territory, with a Gigabit network by 2030, the government mandated the National Communications Authority (ANACOM) to:</p><ul><li>Collect up-to-date information on the coverage of very high capacity networks (VHCN), including information on plans of any undertaking to roll out broadband networks, including VHCN;</li><li>Designate the geographical areas without VHCN (“white areas”) based on the information collected; and</li><li>Prepare the proposals for the specifications of the tendering procedures to be carried out by the government for the installation, operation and maintenance of Gigabit networks in the identified areas.</li></ul><p>In what concerns the provision of mobile services, including broadband services to achieve Gigabit connectivity, the 5G auction regulation established coverage and network development obligations to boost the population's digital skills, economic growth, social inclusion, and the competitiveness of the country and all of its regions. Considering that higher bandwidths are needed to achieve Gigabit connectivity, on 23 December 2021 ANACOM has decided to assess the market’s interest in making the spectrum available in the 26 GHz band. This is one of the pioneer/priority bands for the development of 5G, particularly because it allows for a more limited coverage compared to other frequency bands (700 MHz and 3.6 GHz), but with ultra-high capacity. In this way, new business models and sectors of the economy will be able to benefit from 5G. </p><h3>Other emerging technologies </h3><p class="subtitle">Social Security - Process Automation and Mining </p><p>Social Security adopted the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology and implemented automation of several business processes, including European pensions forms E250/P5000 and special needs education forms. At present, it is starting to evaluate, by means of process mining, other business processes which could be automated. The use of these technologies aims to significantly reduce the process execution time, eliminate the backlog and free human resources to execute other processes.</p><p><img src="img/35-769.jpeg" alt="A picture containing text, computer, person, indoor
