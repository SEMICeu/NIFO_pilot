The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 68 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><img src="img/35-815.png" alt="35-815.png" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2019</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Austria in 2020. </p><img src="img/35-816.jpeg" alt="35-816.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Austria’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average in the Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency), and despite the lower performance with a score of 1 on Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility). This area of improvement (Inclusion and accessibility) is due to an incomplete implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, measures for ensuring that public services are accessible to all European citizens (by complying with e-accessibility specifications) could be further improved to reach the maximum score of 4.</p><img src="img/35-817.jpeg" alt="35-817.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Austrian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance. The remaining potential area of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2, is the interoperability governance. Particularly, the score of 1 for Austria in Recommendation 24, stating that Austria should actively participate in standardisation work relevant to the country’s needs to ensure its requirements are met, lowers the overall organisational interoperability result for Austria, as well as Recommendation 22, which encourages the use of a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assessing and selecting standards and specifications, hinders the country’s results with regard to interoperability governance.</p><img src="img/35-819.jpeg" alt="35-819.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Austria’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an overall good performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations, much aligned with the EU average despite the lack of data in the area of security and privacy. Moreover, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to catalogues and external information sources and services. Concretely, the low availability of catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions described by a common model (Catalogues - Recommendation 44) hinders the overall Austrian score on the Catalogues area. On the other hand, the absence of implementation of the external information sources and services while developing European public services lowers Austria’s score in the area related to external information sources and services.</p><p>Additional information on Austria’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2020-egovernment-works-people">eGovernment Benchmark Report</a>, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

As a result, they have now the opportunity of handling their contacts with the authorities electronically and entirely without a break in media. </p><p>Moreover, the regulatory framework ‘<a href="https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/themen/leben_in_oesterreich/wahlen/6/Seite.320520.html">The Digital Office</a>’ to amend the existing legal frame is currently being developed. It aims at creating a contemporary legal framework for the development, testing and application of new/selected inter-ministerial electronic administrative processes and services and ensuring a broad stakeholder involvement. The framework is being developed in several phases, the first one is planned to be finalized in 2021.</p><p>The most recent amendment of the Austrian eGovernment Act entered into force on 1 January 2021. It established an important step towards ‘Mobile First’ by considering the technical developments with regard to a simplified and at the same time secure smartphone-based use of the electronic identification (eID). It also introduced the legal basis for a digital driver's license for eID holders.</p><p>Furthermore, this year’s highlights include the Austrian <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20010727">Web-Accessibility Act</a>, which defines the accessibility requirements for federal websites and mobile applications so that they are more accessible for users, especially for people with disabilities and implements the Web Accessibility Directive. It entered into force on 23. July 2019. Additional to the federal level, there are 9 different acts in the respective federal states, implementing the Web-Accessibility Directive.</p><p>Lastly, the competent authority on the federal level is the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), which monitors the compliance of websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies (on federal level and also for 7 of the 9 federal states) in Austria with the accessibility requirements.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Public Administration Governance</p><p>With the resolution of the new <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10000873">Federal Ministries Act in 2020</a>, the <a href="https://www.brz.gv.at/en">Austrian Federal Computing Centre</a> (<em>Bundesrechenzentrum</em> – BRZ) was incorporated into the <a href="https://www.bmdw.gv.at/en.html">Federal Ministry for Digitisation and Business Location (BMDW)</a>, transforming it into a competence centre for digitisation.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Public Administration Infrastructure</p><p>Austria has defined as priorities for 2021 the following topics: mobile government (including the start of an ID platform), the implementation of the once-only principle across infrastructures and cloud computing.</p><p>In March 2019, the government relaunched the Austrian One-Stop eGoverment portal for citizens - oesterreich.gv.at. The portal is based on the internationally recognised and award-winning One-stop portal HELP.gv.at. It has been expanded with the introduction of new services for citizens (e.g., baby point and relocation) and relaunched under the new name of <a href="https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/">oesterreich.gv.at</a>. In addition, in March 2019 a chatbot named “Mona” and a dedicated mobile app (Digital Office App) were launched to improve the service quality of Austria’s most used eGoverment portal for citizens. As part of the further development of the mobile phone signature into the ID Austria, the Digital Office App is also to be expanded into an ID platform, including new functionalities (e.g. electronic driving licence or registration certificate).</p><p>Another key focus is on reducing administrative burden. Austria puts very strong emphasis on delivering Public Services using the Once-Only Principle for domestic but also cross border transactions to reduce administrative burden for businesses through automatic data exchange between authorities. Register connection, security and transparency have the highest priority in the implementation of the Once-Only Principle.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/initiativen/verwaltung/verwaltungs-projekte/OECloud.html">Austrian Cloud</a> (Ö-Cloud) initiative was launched on 10 June 2020. The initiative aims to increase Austria's resilience and data sovereignty. Together in partnership with the Austrian industry, Austria will play an active part in the GAIA-X project.

The <a href="https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/aktionsplan/mission.html">vision</a> mainly focuses on competitiveness, innovative strength, prosperity, climate protection, health and cultural heritage, and provides the necessary framework for the <a href="https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/aktionsplan.html">Digitisation Strategy</a>, which in turn consists of several strategic action plans that focus on selected priority topics. The strategy intends to harmonise and merge many existing strategies, and replace partly outdated ones (e.g. the Digital Roadmap Austria). </p><p>With the Digitisation Strategy, Austria aims to (i) make ‘system Austria’ crisis-proof; (ii) enhance competitiveness; (iii) position Austria as a digital innovation region; (iv) make targeted use of data for innovation; (v) design education, training and continuing education as a digital competitive advantage; (vi) promote top digital research in a targeted manner; and (vii) facilitate digital communication between the State and its citizens. This way Austria pursues the goal to establish and further ensure its role as a leading digital nation, and to guarantee and expand prosperity, job opportunities and quality of life in the long term.</p><p>Fostering the digital transformation in selected priority areas and improving user‑centric, modern eGovernment services are among the main objectives within the strategic action plans.

To achieve this goal, the Austrian eGovernment strategies promoted the involvement of and close cooperation between the federal State, cities and municipalities.</p><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Austrian government signed the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other European Union (EU) Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc973043"></a><a id="_Toc1035599"></a>Austrian Interoperability Framework</p><p>The establishment of the Austrian public services was an important initiative which represented a common goal among the different initiatives to which the federal government has agreed to. The approval of the <a href="https://neu.ref.wien.gv.at/at.gv.wien.ref-live/documents/20189/79767/Austrian_Interoperability_Framework__AIF-1.0.0_.pdf/4bc872de-2f08-4749-b7b9-6aa341ad8ad7?version=1.0">Austrian Interoperability Framework (AIF)</a> in January 2015 set a mutual goal to guide, promote and support the delivery of Austrian public services by fostering cross-border, cross-organisation and cross-sector interoperability. The framework addressed issues such as its underlying principles, the conceptual model for public services, the interoperability levels, the interoperability agreements and the interoperability governance.</p><p>More specifically, the purpose of the AIF was: </p><ul><li>to promote and support the delivery of Austrian public services by fostering cross-border, cross-organisation and cross-sector interoperability; </li><li>to guide public administrations in their work to provide Austrian public services to businesses and citizens; and</li><li>to complement and tie together the various Organisational Interoperability Frameworks (OIFs) at Austrian level. </li></ul><p>This non-technical document was addressed to all those involved in defining, designing and implementing Austrian public services. The AIF should be taken into account when making decisions on Austrian public services that support the implementation of Austrian policy initiatives. The AIF should also be considered when establishing public services that in the future may be reused as part of Austrian public services. </p><p class="subtitle">Once-Only principle</p><p>The Once-Only principle has been a <a href="https://www.bmdw.gv.at/Themen/Digitalisierung/Verwaltung/was-bedeutet-digitale-Verwaltung/Bestimmungen-E-GovGesetzes.html">pivotal part</a> of Austria’s digital public administration efforts in recent years, with a strong focus given to this principle within the current <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjqrvO45KLvAhXMC2MBHSPPAAMQFjAAegQIAxAD&amp;url=https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/dam/jcr:ab5e616e-f1e8-4755-9cf5-82ea24619593/33_14_mrv.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2LtXhwhHAcb_MPPv5iAIrw">Austrian government programme</a> as well as the Austrian Digitisation Strategy. The federal government has identified the Once-Only principle, and herewith the reduction of administrative burdens for citizens as well as for companies, as a key issue to be addressed in this legislative period (2020–2024). This includes several measures to alleviate the burden of information obligations on businesses and citizens, that should provide their data only once to the administration.</p><p>Thanks to the smart use of back-office data available to a growing number of public authorities, it became possible to provide to citizens ‘no-stop’ procedures in which visits to or contacts with authorities were eliminated entirely. For example, Austria grants a family allowance for which no application is necessary, i.e. citizens automatically receive the benefits that they are entitled to without having to complete or send in any form. Since the implementation in May 2015, families have automatically received the allowance granted at the birth of a child without having to apply for it. Overall, an estimated 80 000 families a year benefit from this ‛no-stop shopʼ solution.</p><p>At the same time the Austrian government places strong emphasis on improving the framework conditions for companies. This includes taking concrete measures to reduce the information obligations for companies and thus alleviating the administrative burdens. </p><p>The Digital Office regulatory framework amends the existing legal framework in order to create a new legal basis for the development, testing and application of new/selected inter-ministerial electronic administrative processes and services (broad stakeholder involvement is planned to be finalised in 2021). This will further support the implementation of the Once-Only principle. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>Open Government Data</p><p>Fostering the provision and use of open government data to increase transparency and create new opportunities for companies was a major cornerstone of the Austrian government programme ‘<a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/_em_daten/_wzo/2020/01/02/200102-1510_regierungsprogramm_2020_gesamt.pdf">In Responsibility for Austria - Government Programme 2020–2024</a>’.

It was developed on the basis of the Security Strategy and is guided by the principles of the Austrian Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection. More specifically, the strategy is a comprehensive and proactive concept for protecting the cyberspace and the people in the virtual space while guaranteeing human rights. It aims to enhance the security and resilience of Austrian infrastructures and services in the cyberspace. Since new challenges have emerged, Austria is currently updating the Cybersecurity Strategy adopted in 2013.</p><p>Based on the 2013 strategy, an annual report on cybersecurity in Austria was prepared by the Cybersecurity Steering Group.

Austria was one of the first EU Member States to adopt a comprehensive legislation on eGovernment. This act is the core of Austrian laws on eGovernment. It serves as the legal basis for eGovernment instruments and components. Many mechanisms - such as the Citizen Card (<em>Bürgerkarte</em>; in the future, eID or ID Austria), sector-specific personal identifiers and electronic delivery - can also be put to use in the private sector.</p><p>The most important principles of eGovernment law are:</p><ul><li>freedom of choice for users in selecting the means of communication when contacting public authorities; and</li><li>security and improved legal protection provided by appropriate technical measures such as the Citizen Card.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">The recent amendments to the eGovernment Act, which entered into force on 31 December 2020, were made in consideration of the technical developments associated with a simplified smartphone-based use of the eID as well as to increase the data quality and widen the use of the eID. They also introduced the legal basis for a ‘digital’ driver’s license for eID holders.Right to electronic correspondence of citizens with the public administration (according to Article 1a of the eGovernment Act)</p><p>On 1 January 2020, <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20003230">the right to electronic correspondence with authorities</a> entered into force.

Article 13 is relevant to eGovernment in that it regulates the ways in which public authorities and citizens can communicate with each other, such as the transmission of applications by email or web forms. The authority’s website specifies the addresses to which application forms can be sent, whether an electronic signature is needed and which formats are recommended or required for the application.</p><p>Since 1 January 2011, documents issued by public authorities require a handwritten signature, certification or official signature. All electronic copies of paper documents from public authorities are required to have an official signature. The official signature is an advanced electronic signature including specific elements to certify the official origin of the document.</p><p class="subtitle">Web-Accessibility Act</p><p>The Austrian <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20010727">Web-Accessibility Act</a> entered into force on 23 July 2019 and implements the Web Accessibility Directive. It defines the accessibility requirements for federal websites and mobile applications so that they are more accessible for users, especially for people with disabilities. In addition to the federal level, nine different acts implement the Web Accessibility Directive in the respective federal states.</p><p>The competent authority on the federal level is the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG), which monitors the compliance of websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies (on federal level and also for seven out of the nine federal states) in Austria with the accessibility requirements.</p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle">eGovernment Act - Once-Only Principle</p><p>Austria’s <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=BgblAuth&amp;Dokumentnummer=BGBLA_2004_I_10">eGovernment Act</a> contains a provision (Article 17(2)) on the Once-Only principle, which states that public authorities are obliged, pursuant to their technical possibilities and in compliance with the requirements stipulated by law, to draw on the available data of the person concerned from public registers of a client under public law. Thus, certain information (birth certificates, proof of citizenship, proof of residency or documents from the Commercial Registry) need no longer be provided by the person concerned but can, with the person’s consent or with legal authorisation, be directly requested by the authority from an electronic register. The public authority’s responsibility to enable queries in their registers in no way increases their right to release information, since they are based solely on existing authorisations.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474963"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474964"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc973049"></a><a id="_Toc1035606"></a><a id="_Toc1474965"></a>Constitutional Law on Access to Information</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1987_286/ERV_1987_286.pdf">Constitutional Law on Access to Information</a> (Auskunftspflichtgesetz) became effective on 1 January 1988. This law contained <strong>provisions on access to public information </strong>at the federal and regional level. It stipulated a general right of access and obliged federal authorities to answer questions regarding their areas of responsibility, insofar as this did not conflict with a legal obligation to maintain secrecy. However, it did not permit citizens to access documents, but only to receive answers from the government on the content of information.

To achieve the complete transposition of the PSI Directive, pertinent legislation was passed in all nine Austrian <em>Länder</em>.

Although the SVG applies to all trust services, the creation, validation and preservation of electronic signatures continue to be the core. It therefore continues to be possible to sign contracts electronically with an electronic signature with the same effect as if the contract were signed by hand. In addition, an important step for consumer protection was made with the SVG: companies can no longer exclude in hidden clauses the acceptance of the electronic signature and thus, for example, prevent electronic terminations of subscriptions.</p><p>The last amendments to the act, made on 17 May 2018 and 27 December 2018, regarded the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc973057"></a><a id="_Toc1035614"></a><a id="_Toc1474967"></a>Security of Network and Information Systems Act</p><p><a id="_Hlk6320079"></a>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20010536">Security of Network and Information Systems Act</a> was adopted on 28 December 2018 as the transposition of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&amp;uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG">Directive concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems</a> (NIS Directive).</p><p class="subtitle">Data Protection Act</p><p>The Austrian <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.pdf">Data Protection Act</a> (<em>Datenschutzgesetz</em> 2000; DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999) came into effect on 1 January 2000.

Currently, there are <a href="https://www.bmdw.gv.at/Services/ElektronischeZustellung/Allgemeine-Information-zur-eZustellung.html">five privately run delivery services</a> on the market.</p><p>In the future, official notifications will mainly be sent by electronic means. The new electronic delivery system - which can be seen as an evolution of the old system - was launched on 1 December 2019. The new system brings many advantages to citizens, businesses and public authorities. Just like the letterbox in the paper world, recipients only need one system to receive official notifications as well as private mail in the electronic world. This central system is called MyPostbox (<em>meinpostkorb</em>). The revised electronic delivery offers great saving potential for public authorities, citizens and businesses (e.g. postage costs, printing costs and time). The display module MyPostbox bundles documents from different delivery systems into a common view and allows for a single point of registration. This service is available through registration to the platform ​​oesterreich.gv.at and through the app <em>Digitales Amt,</em> as well as for businesspeople in the <a href="http://www.usp.gv.at">Business Service Portal</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic File System</p><p>The Electronic File System (ELAK) was introduced in order to replace paper-based filing and archiving in all Austrian Ministries. An electronic file is created for every written request requiring an answer and every internal project of possible future interest. In this way, every procedure can be easily audited anytime by viewing the file. At the federal level ELAK means that many procedures can now be conducted more efficiently facilitating inter-administrative transactions, which can now be processed using just one medium. The introduction of ELAK brought about significant savings. At the beginning of 2020, a new Electronic File System was launched with further useful features (e.g. team rooms for cross-sector collaboration with private sector partners) and a modernised design.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc973109"></a><a id="_Toc1035670"></a><a id="_Toc973118"></a><a id="_Toc1035679"></a><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Portal Group </p><p>The <a href="https://www.digitales.oesterreich.gv.at/portalverbund">Portal Group</a> is a link-up of administrative portals and the basic infrastructure for the authentication and authorisation of public sector employees when accessing restricted online resources. By implementing the Portal Group protocol, the user management of shared eGovernment applications can be radically simplified, providing a single sign-in for users. The federal administration portal operators are obliged to implement the <a href="https://neu.ref.wien.gv.at/at.gv.wien.ref-live/web/reference-server/ag-iz-oeffentliche-informationen">Portal Group agreement,</a> building a web of trust.

An electronic tool to uniquely identify citizens and businesses is therefore necessary. This electronic identification is the <a href="https://www.buergerkarte.at/">Citizen Card</a> (<em>Bürgerkarte</em>), which be used to sign documents securely and electronically. The digital signature is covered by law and protects against unwanted access and changes to signed content.</p><p>The term Citizen Card is used to describe an identity management concept that makes it possible to provide electronic services for public administration employees and customers in a simple and secure manner. It provides unique user identification and authentication, which are necessary in order to offer certain electronic procedures.</p><p>Since the last quarter of 2009, citizens have been able to choose between two different Citizen Card options. The first is the well-known eCard which is activated as a Citizen Card. The other choice is a mobile phone solution called the <a href="https://www.buergerkarte.at/">Mobile Phone Signature</a> (<em>Handy-Signatur</em>). The Mobile Phone Signature (Citizen Card function on the mobile phone) was developed with the support of the EU Commission in a large EU pilot project on interoperability of electronic identities called STORK. This solution makes it possible to use electronic signatures with a mobile phone. In contrast to the eCard, this option does not require to install additional software and hardware (card reader) or to have chip cards. The Mobile Phone Signature functionalities have been fully integrated in the recently launched <a href="https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/">one-stop citizen portal</a>, as well as in the associated <em>Digitales Amt</em> app (i.e. the mobile version of the portal). </p><p>Since April 2016, the already established Mobile Phone Signature – for qualified electronic signatures and unique identification via web – is also available as a mobile app. Thanks to sophisticated security mechanisms the usage of the app is highly secure, and some additional features (e.g. speed-sign function) ensure a very user‑friendly experience across the digital world. The planned ID platform (for the electronic proof of driving licence and registration certificate) will also be based on the Austrian eID, that is currently being revised to enable further functionalities. </p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc973120"></a><a id="_Toc1035681"></a>Signature Verification</p><p>The <a href="https://www.signatur.rtr.at/en/vd/Pruefung.html">Signature Verification</a> (<em>Signaturprüfung</em>) service is a web application with which it is also possible to verify electronic signatures without installing a specialised software. The supported signatures conform to internationally standardised formats, such as XMLDSIG and CMS, as well as formats used in Austrian eGovernment applications (e.g. PDF-AS). The user interface is both in German and English, depending on the browser settings.

The register and system network means a further important step towards user-centric and efficient eGovernment. Interfaces will allow the data protection-compliant use of existing data.

The high Austrian data protection level remains untouched.</p><p>Highly relevant for the Once-Only principle implementation in Austria is Austria’s <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=BgblAuth&amp;Dokumentnummer=BGBLA_2004_I_10">eGovernment Act</a>. The eGovernment Act contains a provision (Article 17(2)) on the Once-Only principle, which states that public authorities are obliged, pursuant to their technical possibilities and in compliance with the requirements stipulated by law, to draw on the available data of the person concerned from public registers of a client under public law. Thus, certain information (birth certificates, proof of citizenship, proof of residency or documents from the Commercial Registry) need no longer be provided by the person concerned but can, with the person’s consent or with legal authorisation, be directly requested by the authority from an electronic register. The public authority’s responsibility to enable queries in their registers in no way increases their right to release information, since they are based solely on existing authorisations.</p><p class="subtitle">EUCARIS, ECRIS and EULIS</p><p>Austria is a member of <a href="https://www.eucaris.net/countries/austria/">EUCARIS</a> and <a href="https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_criminal_records-95-en.do">ECRIS</a>, and also has full connection to EULIS.</p><h2>Emerging Technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Cloud Computing - Ö-Cloud</p><p>The <a href="https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/initiativen/verwaltung/verwaltungs-projekte/OECloud.html">Austrian Cloud (Ö-Cloud)</a> initiative was launched on 10 June 2020.
