This was done to bring Luxembourgish legislation in line with Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market, known as eIDAS.</p><p>The eIDAS Regulation provided the EU with a comprehensive transnational and cross-sector framework to increase trust in the electronic exchange of trust services within the EU and to promote the functioning of the internal market and legal certainty. </p><p>Luxembourg has implemented the eIDAS and was among the first Member States who declared use of their eID scheme.</p><p class="subtitle">eCommerce Act </p><p>The <a href="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2000/08/14/n8/jo">eCommerce Act</a> of 14 August 2000, complemented by a <a href="http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/2001/0712206/0712206.pdf#page=17">regulation</a> of 1 June, 2001 on electronic signatures and electronic payments, transposed the EU Directive on Electronic Signatures (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:en:HTML">1999/93/EC</a>).</p><p>The eCommerce Act explicitly mentioned two types of eSignatures: 1) a basic type, which consists of a ‘set of data which is linked to the deed in a non-dissociable way and warrants the integrity of the deed […] The electronic signature must also ensure the signatory is identified and show the latter's obvious consent to the content of the deed’, and 2) an eSignature ‘supported by a qualified certificate, which must be created with a secure signature creation device under the sole control of the subscriber’.</p><p>Certification service providers can only issue certificates with the approval of the National Accreditation and Supervision Authority. Approved (qualified) certificates are valid for a maximum duration of three years and must be archived by the certification service provider for at least 10 years. Also, the certification providers have to submit to periodic external security audits.</p><p>eSignatures supported by a qualified certificate have the same legal validity as a handwritten signature, and the eCommerce Act rendered void all laws and regulations that challenged the validity of a contract because it was electronically signed.</p><p>The Act's primary importance resided in recognition of eSignatures and eContracts. Unlike the Directive it was based on, it did not use the term ‘advanced’ eSignature but rather recognised a ‘qualified’ level of eSignature. It also differs from the Directive and similar legislation in other Member States, insofar as it legally recognised electronic wills and electronic deeds and implemented a customer's right to withdraw from an electronic contract within seven days after its creations, free of questions and penalties, with full reimbursement of any money paid to the seller.</p><p>The Act closely followed the Directive in terms of information requirements from seller to customer, the seller's obligation to acknowledge reception of an order, the rules governing the liability and confidentiality requirements for certificate issuers (domestic and foreign), and provisions concerning the auditing and accreditation of certificate issuers.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474966"></a>Security aspects related to digital government</h3><p class="subtitle">EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</p><p>In May 2018, the <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a> entered into force in the whole EU and therefore also in <a href="http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2018/08/01/a686/jo">Luxembourg</a>.

This site is of interest not only for the inhabitants of Luxembourg, but also for any foreigners who wish to find pertinent information on Luxembourg. </p><p class="subtitle">Guichet.lu</p><p>The Government of Luxembourg launched, on 17 November 2008, the new <a href="http://www.guichet.lu"><em>Guichet.lu</em></a> portal which targets both citizens and enterprises. The portal was <a href="https://gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites/toutes_actualites/communiques/2018/06-juin/25-presentation-guichetlu.html">relaunched</a> on its tenth anniversary.</p><p>The portal comprises information on various themes and related administrative procedures, grouped by theme (taxes, employment, family, education, accommodation, citizenship and transport). This interactive platform allows citizens to accomplish their administrative formalities online in a simple and transparent manner. The platform is regularly enriched with new elements such as the interactive tax return (introduced in January 2009) and the content of the <a href="http://www.entreprises.public.lu/">Business portal</a>, which has been entirely restructured, and integrated in this website. Both the citizens' and business parts of <em>Guichet.lu</em> were completely redesigned in 2013 in order to improve ergonomics and accessibility, and to integrate applications for mobile devices (smartphones and tablets). Beyond the visual makeover and the restructuring and updating of the content, <em>Guichet.lu</em> was also migrated to a new technical platform in order to provide a more user-friendly transactional service (the <a href="http://www.guichet.public.lu/myguichet/en/index.html"><em>myGuichet</em></a> eSafe) on the user side, and better back- and front office tools on the provider side. </p><p><em>Guichet.lu</em>’s primary objective is to improve<strong> </strong>the<strong> </strong>value<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>quality<strong> </strong>of electronic services integrating various administrative formalities in a single Internet portal that gathers all relevant procedures, forms and information made available by the State.</p><p>In addition, this portal guides the user through the several stages thanks to online service wizards (<em>assistants de service</em>). Users have access to them when equipped with an electronic authentication certificate (LuxTrust Token, Smartcard, Signing Stick, or ID Card). Those certificates guarantee highly secure information exchanges and personal data confidentiality along with an electronic signature.</p><p>Exchanges between the State and citizens through this portal are mandated by the Ministry for Digitalisation in collaboration with the competent ministries.
