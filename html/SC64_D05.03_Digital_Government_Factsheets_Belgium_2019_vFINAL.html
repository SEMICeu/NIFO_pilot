The programme’s three ambitions to be achieved by 2020 included Belgium as one of Europe’s  top three digital economies, generating 1 000 new start-ups, and creating 50 000 jobs for the national economy.   </p><p><strong>Five priorities of the strategy</strong></p><p>Digital Belgium outlined the Government’s long-term digital vision for the country, then translated this vision into specific policy goals. Belgium designated five major priorities that contained three to six priority projects each in the areas of:</p><ol><li>Digital economy;</li><li>Digital infrastructure;</li><li>Digital skills and jobs;</li><li>Digital trust and digital security;</li><li>Digital government.</li></ol><p>A number of new initiatives were started. The Start-up Plan, for example, was a concrete first step to encourage young and beginning entrepreneurs to set up new businesses in innovative sectors via initiatives such as tax shelters for start-ups and fiscal incentives for crowdfunding. There was also an initiative to roll-out eInvoicing for suppliers. Further initiatives are to be launched such as the National Alliance for Digital Skills and Jobs, a plan for a roll-out of high-speed internet, a Digital Health Valley, Digital Act (a series of legal propositions enabling the use of electronic signatures, digital archiving, and similar, to replace paper), deployment of the federal cloud, mobile authentication for eGovernment applications, a multi-directional digital communication platform and an open data strategy.</p><p class="subtitle">Federal eGovernment Strategy (2009 - present)</p><p><strong>Vision, objectives and actions</strong></p><p>The Federal <a href="https://www.ksz-bcss.fgov.be/en">eGovernment strategy</a> for the  social sector aims to create a single virtual Public Administration while respecting the privacy of users, as well as the specificities and competences of all Government bodies and administrative layers.</p><p>Its main objective is to improve the delivery of public services for citizens and businesses by rendering it faster, more convenient, less constraining and more open. </p><p>The current strategy is outlined thus: </p><ul><li>Formulation of specific objectives, like the optimal service delivery to citizens, the limitation of administrative burden and the optimisation of the efficiency and effectiveness of public services;</li><li>Explicit choice of a collaboration among all stakeholders in order to create added value for users of eGovernment services;</li><li>Use of a common vision for the use of information in terms of modelling information, mandatory reporting of supposed errors, electronic exchange of information, unique collection of information;</li><li>Use of a common vision for information security and protection of privacy;</li><li>Maximum use of common elements for networks, eID, middleware interconnected and related basic services;</li><li>Role of the <a href="https://www.ksz-bcss.fgov.be/en">Crossroads Bank for Social Security</a> (CBSS) as a driver for the development of eGovernment in the social sector;</li><li>Establishment of a strong partnership among all social security institutions.</li></ul><p><strong>Four strategic streams</strong></p><p>To meet the objectives stated above, the Belgian eGovernment strategy has been based in the past on four main strategic streams:</p><ul><li>1<sup>st </sup>stream: Re-engineering and integrating service delivery </li></ul><p>This first stream focused on user needs, life events and simplification of all administrative procedures. </p><ul><li>2<sup>nd</sup> stream: Cooperation among all levels of Government to provide integrated services across organisational boundaries and administrative layers. The second stream was based on two documents. First, the eGovernment cooperation agreement, signed in March 2001 by the Federal, Regional and Community authorities, laid down a framework of cooperation according to which all layers of Government were committed to use the same standards, the same identification infrastructure and the same eSignature. Second, the cooperation agreement on the principles of a seamless eGovernment, signed in April 2006, with the objective to use ICTs that provide information to all citizens, businesses and public institutions in a user-friendly way.</li><li>3<sup>rd</sup> stream: Simplification of administrative procedures for citizens and businesses.</li></ul><p>This requires an increased exchange and sharing of both data and information among Government Departments and Agencies.</p><ul><li>4<sup>th</sup> stream: Back office integration and protection of personal data.</li></ul><p>The Department or Agency that requires specific data will be considered most frequently as a trusted source by other administrations that may need such data.

The strategy marked the Walloon Government’s stated ambition to transform Wallonia into a connected and intelligent territory, one where technological companies are recognised leaders at the global level and are a driving force behind the region’s successful industrial transformation. The Digital Strategy of Wallonia is one of the main contributors to the creation of Digital Wallonia. </p><p>The strategy includes five main themes for achieving the digital ambition of Wallonia. Each theme is structured into strategic objectives and development axis. It is hoped that through their complementarity and interaction, the themes, objectives and axes will foster the digital transformation in Wallonia. There is a total of 5 themes, 9 strategic objectives and 23 priority development axes. The five themes are: </p><ol><li>Economy of the numeric: this theme focuses on the creation of a strong technological sector through a growth program, which aims to give Wallonia’s digital sector an international dimension. </li><li>Economy of the digital: this theme focuses on increasing the digital capabilities of companies, essential for the emergence for the development of connected commerce.</li><li>Connected and intelligent territory: this theme aims to achieve full high-speed connectivity in Wallonia. </li><li>Open utilities: this theme aims to foster open and transparent digital public services. </li><li>Skills and employment: this theme focuses on developing the digital skills of Wallonia’s citizens.</li></ol><p>The Walloon Government earmarked more than EUR 500 million for the implementation of the strategy over a period of four years.</p><p class="subtitle">eGovernment Strategy of Flanders</p><p>In the Flemish Region, the eGovernment strategy is placed under the responsibility of the Deputy Minister-President of the Flemish Government. It is managed by the new Flanders Information Agency created in 2015 as the fusion of the <a href="http://www.corve.be/">Coordination Cell Flemish eGovernment</a> (CORVE), the <a href="http://www.vlaamseinfolijn.be/"><em>Vlaamse Infolijn</em></a> (the Flemish Government call-centre), the <a href="https://www.agiv.be/">Flanders Geographical Information Agency</a> (AGIV) and part of the Department Administrative Affairs. This new agency is responsible for the new eGovernment programme <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/radicaal-digitaal"><em>Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaal</em></a> (Flanders radically digital), which aims to have Flemish Government services fully digitally by 2020. It will also ensure that the principle of the once only collection of data (known as the MAGDA principle) is acknowledged by the entirety of the Flemish administration. </p><p>The main responsibility of the Flanders Information Agency was to determine the strategic aims and priorities for the transformation of the Flemish government into a data-driven government, while taking part in eGovernment projects in an advisory and supportive role. The agency was also in charge of developing eGovernment-related knowledge and skills, coordinating and providing incentives, and creating a generic eGovernment infrastructure to facilitate cooperation among the different entities within Flanders administration. This generic eGovernment infrastructure consisted of a number of eGovernment building blocks (electronic identification and trust services, electronic documents, eProcurement, authentic sources, etc.) that could be used as shared systems to improve existing (electronic) service delivery &amp; streamline government operations. The agency provided additional funding for cross-departmental eGovernment projects (<a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/radicaal-digitaal"><em>Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaal</em></a> projects).</p><p>A key policy element in this eGovernment policy was the development of authentic sources of information. These were databases that can be used to obtain complete, correct and up-to-date data on businesses, natural persons, addresses, plots, buildings, maps, etc. A comprehensive system of Flemish authentic data sources and related services is now being built. In parallel to that, a SOA-based infrastructure called the <a href="http://www.corve.be/">MAGDA platform</a> was introduced in February 2006, to enable the integration of government data exchange services and facilitate both the access to authentic data sources and the data exchange among public bodies. In the past eight years, more than EUR 10 million has been invested in this platform. In 2013, the roll-out of the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/egovernment/document/magda-20-platform-magda">MAGDA 2.0</a> platform was completed, a new version of the platform which provides additional data exchange facilities (web services, file transfer etc.), while at the same time requiring lower operational costs. In 2017, the migration of this very successful platform to a cloud-based environment began.</p><p>In the Flemish eGovernment Strategy 2009-2014, the Flemish Minister responsible for eGovernment, Geert Bourgeois, called upon eGovernment to focus its efforts on developing integrated solutions, contributing to administrative simplification and increasing government efficiency. This included renewed attention to the creation of authentic data sources, and specific attention towards eParticipation, green ICT and the use of open data. A key challenge during this period was extending the back-end eGovernment services provided by the MAGDA platform towards all the local government organisations.</p><p>In the new Flemish eGovernment Strategy 2014-2019, the Flemish Minister responsible for eGovernment, Liesbeth Homans, aimed to ‘radically digitally’ transform the Flemish administration, by going for a digital first approach in the (increasingly mobile) delivery of new (or existing) Flemish government services. In this transformation, the focus was on a customer-centred approach in the design of these digital government services, and on the development of new eGovernment building blocks (such as a personalised portal page for citizens and enterprises, with single sign-on and secure electronic document delivery) that would made available for integrated eGovernment use by the local government organisations. Open data would be the norm as far as the availability and possible re-use of government data was concerned.</p><p class="subtitle">eGovernment Strategy of the Brussels-Capital Region</p><p>In May 2014, after the elections, the Government <a href="http://www.parlbruparl.irisnet.be/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Accord-de-majorite-REG-FR.pdf">unveiled its policy</a>.

The first-generation G-Cloud services became operative since March 2015 and many improvements are still being implemented.</p><p>The G-Cloud is a hybrid cloud service which uses services provided by private companies operating in public cloud environments and services hosted in government data-centres. The G-Cloud is managed by the Government. Its expansion and operational functioning rely on a large extent on private sector services. </p><p>The G-Cloud services operate in four different domains. The services offer is gradually being extended and improved, based on the actual needs of the participating institutions. Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IAAS), Platform-as-a-Service (PAAS) and Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) are all included. The G-Cloud program will also encompass synergy initiatives in the field of classic ICT undertaken from the government. New services will be added upon their availability. </p><p>The 'hard' infrastructure services ensure that government applications are able to run in a reliable physical environment including data-centre housing, servers and storage. The complete virtual capacity can be flexibly modified in a fully managed IAAS environment (Infrastructure-as-a-Service). They are supplemented by 'soft' infrastructure, which allows for high-quality back-ups, security &amp; identity and authorisation management. </p><p>Platform-as-a-Service services are mainly focused on developing the new generation of software: cloud-enabled and cloud-native applications using the latest architecture.

Belnet connectivity includes access to the pan-European research network <a href="http://archive.dante.net/Backbones/GEANT/Pages/GEANT.aspx">Géant</a> and the American <a href="http://www.internet2.edu/">Internet2</a>.</p><p>Belnet also operates a central infrastructure for exchanging internet traffic for internet service, and content providers and large private companies, called the Belgian National Internet Exchange or BNIX. Other activities include the Federal Metropolitan Area Network (<a href="http://www.fedict.belgium.be/de/Images/FEDMAN-CASE_tcm463-119515.pdf">FedMAN</a>), the supercomputing network GRID, and the Belgian National Computer Emergency Response Team, <a href="http://www.cert.be">CERT.be</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">FedMAN</p><p><a href="http://www.fedict.belgium.be/en/infrastructure/network_access/fedman">FedMAN</a>, launched by the <a href="http://www.fedict.be/">Federal Department for ICT (Fedict)</a> in September 2002, is the Federal Metropolitan Area Network which connects the Administrations of 15 federal ministries and Government service buildings in Brussels. FedMAN offers 80 000 federal civil servants with a shared high-speed network and a number of related services supporting the delivery of eGovernment, including access to the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/5014/5584.html">TESTA</a> (Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations) network of the European Union. The first level of FedMAN is a central platform while the second level enables the creation of virtual networks for each Federal Administration. Federal Departments have the right to use the central platform to create their own security environments.</p><p>An upgraded version of FedMAN, FedMAN II, whose capacities are ten times superior to the original version, has been operational since March 2006. It is intended to allow for the launch of new services, such as the Voice over IP and infrastructure-sharing between different federal departments.</p><p class="subtitle">Federal Service Bus (FSB)</p><p>The <a href="http://registry.fsb.pr.belgium.be/web/service-catalog/partner/homepage">Federal Service Bus</a> (FSB), which started in 2006, is service-oriented and allows a simplified connection among the various applications and the Federal Administration’s IT data files. At the same time, FSB is set to ensure the follow-up of specific processes. Access should also be open to private companies by means of authorisation.</p><p>Together with the newly available Database Centre of Fedict, the FSB is intended to contribute to the achievement of the 'Connected Government' architecture of Fedict. Fedict thus foresees a sound basic structure for eGovernment as, via a unique contact point, users can access all the web services of the various Government Departments. </p><p class="subtitle">IRISnet</p><p><a href="http://www.irisnet.eu/en?set_language=en">IRISnet</a> is the name of the Brussels-Capital Region broadband network, designed to simplify the telecommunications among regional public bodies.

The new platform fulfils three basic functions: it makes data easily accessible in the form that best suits everyone's needs (for this, standardised APIs are used); it ensures the quality of the data (by using standards elaborated within OSLO or INSPIRE); ensures the integrity of the data so that no third party has the possibility to change the data during transport and, in case of personal data, to support its partners in the confidential and secure processing of the data throughout the entire process. The platform was a result of the merger of the existing MAGDA and GDI platforms.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Belgian eID card</p><p>The <a href="http://eid.belgium.be/">Belgian eID</a> card contains all the information included on the traditional identity card and serves as an identification and travel document. It is a smart card containing two certificates: one for authentication and another one for generating digital signatures. The Belgian eID thus gives access to restricted online services, making Internet use safer by providing an online means of identification, the electronic submission of official documents, and other related services. The national register number, the unique identification number for Belgian citizens, appears on the eID card and its microchip. It is used as the unique identifier in the certificate of the eID card.</p><p>It is to be noted that almost all of the electronic signature applications in the Belgian eGovernment sector make use of the Belgian eID card. On the federal eGovernment portal <a href="http://www.mybelgium.be/">MyBelgium.be</a>, multiple levels of security exist, depending on the type of eService delivered: (1) no password required; (2) password required; (3) password and token required; (4) eID only, (5) unconnected eID, (6) mobile authorisation (time based one-time password (TOTP)). The eID card can only be issued for natural persons.</p><p>On 16 March 2009, Belgium introduced an electronic ID card for the under-12s (Kids-ID), which, apart from the classic ID functions, can provide access to children-only Internet chat rooms and to a range of emergency phone numbers, should the child be in danger. Furthermore, since July 2008, foreign nationals living in Belgium are entitled to replace their old paper identity with versatile and ‘smart’ electronic identity cards. These cards come in two varieties: for EU and non-EU citizens.</p><p>The federal administration approves wireless alternatives to the wired eID reader. A first solution was approved in 2015 and integrated in the Federal Authentication Service (FAS). eGovernment applications that make use of the FAS can benefit from the new wireless authentication service. This is already the case for the Irisbox one-stop-shop of the Brussels Region.</p><p class="subtitle">Federal Signing Box</p><p>This <a href="https://sign.belgium.be/">application</a> allow users to electronically sign files, and verify signed files, by means of their eID.</p><p class="subtitle">eSignBox</p><p><a href="https://signature.wallonie.be/eSign/">This tool</a>, created by the Walloon public authorities, allows easy digital signing of electronic documents and files. In practice, users can sign a file but also check an existing signed file and its certificate.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital signature platform of Flanders</p><p>The <a href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/nl">digital signature platform of Flanders</a> was launched on 20 September 2010 by the Flemish eGovernment and ICT-Management Unit (<em>Entiteit eGovernment en ICT-Beheer</em> (e-IB)). Since then, all public authorities of the regional government of Flanders have been able to digitally sign documents in a legal way via the platform. More specifically, the platform converts the files it receives into ready-to-sign PDF documents which can be distributed to and signed by the various parties using their Belgian electronic identity cards (eID). Citizens, businesses and the external partners of the Flemish Government benefit from many advantages such as legal validity, user friendliness, the possibility of signing by multiple parties, support for different document formats, open standards and a Greener ICT.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital certificates</p><p>The Commercial certification authorities' <a href="http://www.belgianchambers.be/en/">certificates</a> can be used in a number of eGovernment applications, as an alternative to eID card signatures. Since 2007, the Federal Government has recognised three private certification authorities complying with the required standards regarding qualified certificates defined in the Belgian eSignatures Act. Their certificates were used for certain eGovernment applications, in particular tax and social security eServices. Like the eID, these digital certificates contained certain identity data, the public key connected with the certificate holder, the public key usage, the validity and the category of the certificate. They were issued to natural persons and legal entities. </p><p class="subtitle">Biometric passports</p><p>In November 2004, Belgium scored a world first by becoming the first country to start issuing <a href="https://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/services/services_abroad/belgian_passport/applying_passport">electronic passports</a> complying with the recommendations of the <a href="http://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)</a>. These passports featured a contact-less microchip storing personal identification data and biometric information (facial image of the holder). Fingerprints were added at a later stage.</p><p class="subtitle">IT’SME Mobile Application</p><p>The <a href="https://www.passezaudigital.be/croissance-itsme">mobile application</a> allows citizens to securely authenticate themselves for access to digital public services. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital Keys</p><p><a href="https://iamapps.belgium.be/sma/generalinfo?view=home">Digital Keys</a> provided by CSAM allow citizens and businesses to securely log-on to various platforms and website offering public services.

CSAM is also responsible for provision of the following services: FAS, which handles the identification and authentication of users, BTB for managing access managers within a company or organisation and SSM for managing mandates that a user gives to another entity in order to act on his or her behalf. </p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Public Procurement portal</p><p>Launched at the beginning of 2008, the <a href="http://www.publicprocurement.be/nl/publicprocurementbe-english-0">Belgian public procurement portal</a> provides links to portals and platforms which currently cover three of the main aspects of the procurement process, particularly eNotification, eTendering and eCatalogue.</p><p class="subtitle">eNotification platform</p><p>Launched in 2002 as the instrument used by the Federal Government for the electronic publication of calls for tender, the <a href="https://enot.publicprocurement.be/home.do">platform</a> presents all federal and non-federal entities calls for tender. The platform assists public bodies in drafting their calls for tender and submitting them electronically to the official publication organisations, enabling them to notify invitations to tender, contract awards, as well as other documents such as minutes of clarification meetings or technical notes. On the other hand, it allows businesses to browse and search tender opportunities and related documentation.

These databases, known as ‘authentic sources’, can be referred to by other federal services in need of this type of information. This way, citizens and businesses will be asked to convey data once only. The following can be found among the operational authentic sources:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.ibz.rrn.fgov.be/index.php?id=34&amp;L=0">National Register</a>: managed by the Interior Department, the National Register gathers basic data relating to all persons holding the Belgian nationality.</li><li><a href="http://economie.fgov.be/fr/entreprises/BCE/index.jsp">Crossroads Bank for Enterprises</a>: managed by the Economy Department, CBE is an integrated business register that contains all authentic sources of all Belgian enterprises such as company name, company number, postal and email address, legal type, activities performed within the company, professional skills of the company staff etc. </li></ul><p>Similar infrastructure elements are implemented at the regional level. For instance, in February 2006, the Coordination Cell Flemish eGovernment (CORVE) launched <a href="http://www.corve.be/producten/magda-diensten/ondernemingsgegevens/scherm/index.php">VKBO-GO</a>, the online application of the Flemish Crossroads Bank for Enterprises.</p><p>In Wallonia and Wallonia-Brussels Federation, <a href="http://www.ksz-bcss.fgov.be/fr/bcss/page/content/websites/belgium/security/security_05.html">a Crossroad Bank for Data Exchange</a> (<em>BCED - Banque Carrefour d'échange de données</em>) launched in May 2013.</p><p>This is an exchange platform facilitating data sharing among administrations of Wallonia and WBF.

The staff are composed of members of eWBS, Etnic and DTIC. </p><p>Brussels region has also rolled out a similar exchange platform called <a href="https://bric.brussels/en/our-solutions/infrastructure-solutions/fidus?set_language=en">Fidus</a>. Fidus is a regional services integrator, and legal administrator of electronic data exchanges from and to institutions in the Brussels-Capital Region (provided the data comes from authentic sources).</p><p class="subtitle">MAGDA Platform</p><p>The <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/document/magda-20-platform-magda">MAGDA platform</a>, introduced in February 2006, is a SOA-based interconnecting infrastructure for base registries at regional level to enable the integration of government data exchange services and facilitate both the access to authentic data sources and the data exchange among public bodies.  </p><p>The MAGDA platform ensures that data from authentic sources can be picked up from databases in a secure manner. Several Flemish and federal databases are accessed via MAGDA services. Thanks to the platform, the citizens and businesses do not have to submit their data more than once to the government. </p><p>MAGDA is connected with base registries at federal level through the relevant service integrators. When consuming the data in various formats, it transforms the data to a single MAGDA format, thus ensuring that all users have to deal only with a single data format. It also handles data privacy issues making this process transparent for users. </p><p>MAGDA contains non-geographic data, while the Geographic Digital Infrastructure (GDI) allows for access to geospatial data. </p><p class="subtitle">eCommunities</p><p>eCommunities is a groupware application that has been made accessible to civil servants since April 2003 through the <a href="http://www.belgium.be/">federal eGovernment portal 'Belgium.be'</a>. It aims to enable communication, cooperation, knowledge management and sharing within cross-departmental networks of expertise. Functionalities of the system include: document management, simple and advanced search capabilities, content management and joint working tools. There are currently over 36 eCommunities.</p><p class="subtitle">IWF</p><p><a href="https://irisbox.irisnet.be/">Intelligent Web Forms (IWF)</a> is a tool developed to help citizens and businesses in filling on-line forms. This tool pre-loads information directly for clients, making the process faster and easier. In order to avoid typing the same information several times (or typing an information at all), IWF automatically displays auto-filling suggestions. Once user is logged in, the system shows the information in compliance with the ones contained in the National Register. </p><p>In addition, upon user’s authorisation, this tool is able to retrieve new information and categorises information by typology of data. This application follows the ‘snowball effect’ - each time citizens or business owners allows storage of new information, the potential for reuse is ramped up and the amount of time to fill the next form is exponentially reduced. As a side effect, the quality and consistency of the information supplied is only expected to improve.</p><p>This tool can have a significant impact in terms of time saved, considering the potential number of users and the number of on-line forms that can use this application.</p><h2>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>European Business Register</p><p>Belgium is a member of <a href="http://www.ebr.org/index.php/member-countries/european-interactive-map/belgium/">European Business Register</a>, which is a network of National Business Registers. </p><p class="subtitle">EUCARIS</p><p>Belgium has been a member of <a href="https://www.eucaris.net/countries/belgium/">EUCARIS</a> since 1994, within which it is providing vehicular information.
