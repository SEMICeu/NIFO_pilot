The inclusion of different stakeholders involved in the development of the Guidelines provides a solid ground for a 360-degree analysis of current shortcomings, as well as a thorough understanding of future development needs and priorities, following the overall objective of enhancing the national competitiveness, economic growth and job creation.  </p><p>The goal of the Guidelines is to provide the opportunity for anyone to use ICT, to create a knowledge-based economy and to improve the overall quality of life by contributing to the national competitiveness and increasing economic growth and job creation. </p><p>Special attention in the Guidelines is devoted to the implementation of the open data principle in the public administration. This principle unleashes the growth potential of the digital economy, by making data and information resources created by the public administration easily available to society, thereby establishing a precondition for the spur of new innovative, data-driven business ideas, services, and products. The other cornerstone of the Guidelines is optimising operating processes in the public administration and increasing its efficiency as well as simplifying delivery of public services, by means of efficient and effective eServices and interoperable information systems. It is expected to have an indirect, but very clear positive impact on economic growth, since eGovernment will lead to reduced administrative burden and costs for entrepreneurs, streamlining their interactions with public administration, and allowing them to spare more resources for their entrepreneurship.</p><p>Considering the national priorities in the area of Information Society, and objectives of the European Digital Agenda, Guidelines define seven action lines. </p><p>The main priorities and action plans of the guidelines are presented below: </p><p><strong>1. ICT education and eSkills.</strong></p><p>Activities in the field of eSkills will focus on the areas that will facilitate small and medium sized enterprises as well as citizens' motivation for acquiring eSkills. Planned actions include: public information campaigns, development of eSkills for both citizens and entrepreneurs, increasing the ICT competences of public administration, fostering skills of ICT practitioners and professionals to be in line with the requirements of the labour market, as well as increasing focus on algorithmic thinking (the learning of the programmers’ way of thinking by studying mathematics and computer sciences) and information literacy in educational programmes.</p><p><strong>2. Widely available access to the Internet.</strong></p><p>Actions planned under this priority include mapping of transport networks, provision for further broadband development, and covering all elements of electronic communications network infrastructure. Detailed description of the required actions in those fields is included in the <a href="http://likumi.lv/doc.php?id=253311">Concept for Development of the Next Generation Broadband Electronic Communications Networks for 2013–2020</a> (in Latvian).</p><p><strong>3. Modern and efficient public administration.</strong></p><p>The main benefits of this action will be reflected in the improved efficiency of the public administration (decision-making process, accuracy, conformity to the real situation, the possibility of involving wide public groups in policy planning, evaluation and reduction of administrative costs) as well as delivery of clear, timely and consistent information to citizens about their rights and services of the public administration. Actions will create opportunities for citizens to be widely involved in decision-making and law-making processes using modern technologies. Cooperation and synergies between public and private sector services has a significant administrative burden reduction potential.</p><p>Actions for the modernisation of the public administration will be focused on the modernisation of public administration processes, public eParticipation and eDemocracy and ICT infrastructure optimisation. One of the focal points for eGovernment infrastructure modernisation will be the establishment of central building blocks and integration infrastructure to be used by all institutions of public administration for the modernisation of public service delivery and for connecting national eGovernment infrastructure to cross-border platforms. Another focus is on open interfaces (API’s) allowing also for third party developers to develop end-user applications for government services and develop their own products and services using government data. </p><p><strong>4. eServices and digital content for the public.</strong></p><p>Digital content has an increasingly crucial role in the country’s economic and social development. Digital content plays a key role in research and education as well as in cultural and the public administration sector services. eGovernment solutions enable opportunities for institutions to offer the citizens more accessible and convenient public services, including education and health services, cultural and educational content, and create conditions for a better business environment and social processes.</p><p>A series of actions are planned within this stream of activity: </p><ul><li>Opening public administration data and transaction services to other users; </li><li>Developing shared platform and re-usable software components and modules for providing public services; </li><li>Implementing an official electronic address for citizens and entrepreneurs; </li><li>Delivering and accepting automated electronic invoices; </li><li>Digitisation and accessibility of the cultural heritage and digitisation of public services; </li><li>Encouraging the use of Latvian language in the digital environment; </li><li>Efficient implementation of eHealth solutions for safe and patient-centred health care.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Cross-border cooperation for Digital Single Market.</strong></p><p>By the free movement of people, goods and services, Latvia is a part of the Digital Single Market. To provide cross-border cooperation in the Digital Single Market, free movement of goods and services as well as the free flow of citizens, national eGovernment solutions should be able to interoperate with the EU solutions (building blocks provided by EU projects such as eSENS, STORK, PEPPOL etc.). Accordingly, actions are planned to ensure that the national eGovernment solutions are interoperable with EU platforms and have content for cross-border services and solutions for exchange of information across different sectors. </p><p><strong>6. ICT research and innovation.</strong></p><p>Investments in innovation, research and development are crucial also for the companies whose products and provided services in the digital age are subject to even faster technological and process rate changes. Development of ICT research in computer science, information technology, electronics, telecommunications, communication studies as well as innovative support for companies developing new ICT products and technologies, support for development and establishment of new innovative companies. The development of technology transfer systems must be seen in connection with overall objectives of the Information Society.</p><p><strong>7. Trust and security. </strong></p><p>A secure and reliable electronic information space, where the continuity of essential services for the public administration and the public is ensured, is an essential component for the successful development of the Information Society. An important aspect for the development of Information Society is public trust in the electronic environment. ICT security, human safety and trust in electronic environment are areas where further action is planned.</p><p>The implementation of the Guidelines will build upon the technological potential and experience obtained from the previous period (2007 - 2013).</p><p>Implementation of the Guidelines is planned from the state budget as well as with attracting the EU Structural Funds and private funding. In the long-term, implementation of the Guidelines will facilitate effective and efficient use of budgetary resources for ICT, improving the efficiency of business processes, the quality and availability of the public services.</p><p>The Digital Single Market remains a keynote of the Digital Agenda for Europe. Latvia, by following these Guidelines, will ensure its contribution to the implementation of the Digital Agenda at the national level, as well as the development of the Digital Single Market.</p><p class="subtitle">Concept of the organisational model of public ICT management</p><p>On 15 January 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers approved concept <a href="http://www.varam.gov.lv/eng/darbibas_veidi/e_gov/?doc=13317">of the organisational model of public ICT management</a>. The implementation of this model will frame public ICT strategies, principles and scenarios that will ensure strategic coordination of public ICT development and maintenance through partly centralised management: competence and responsibility in ICT management will be shared between the national and sector levels. This optimal ICT management model identifies the main parties involved: the public ICT organisation, sector ICT organisations, hybrid ICT organisations, public administration senior ICT managers forum, and sector ICT management councils. To achieve the aim of optimal ICT management, both public- and private-sector resources will be used, providing effective cooperation focusing on benefits for the public and the creation and maintenance of convenient and user-friendly eGovernment solutions.</p><p>Regular monthly meetings of public administration senior ICT managers have significantly improved cross-sectoral communication at ICT management level, providing one of the cornerstones for successful implementation of reuse and efficient collaboration principles defined in the Conceptual Architecture of Public Administration information Systems.    </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Third National Action Plan for Open Government Partnership</p><p>On 4 July 2017, the Cabinet of Ministers approved the report for improving the public services environment.

The eID card contains biometric data and information in electronic form to enable electronic verification of the holder's identity and creation of a secure eSignature. As such, the eID card can serve both as an identity and travel document within the EU and as a personal identification tool for eServices, in addition to providing a secure electronic signature.

In the register of natural persons, the range of entities will be extended to foreign nationals who enter into legal relationships with the State, for example by purchasing real estate or buying companies. At present, foreigners are not assigned individual personal codes centrally, i.e. each institution assigns its own identifier, and this situation will be fixed. Contribution to the optimisation of public administration work: uniform registration of all natural persons would avoid the fact that the same information about a third-country national is repeatedly included and manually updated in different national information systems.</p><p class="subtitle">Base register for pets</p><p>The unified register of domestic animals is maintained by the Agricultural Data Centre.
