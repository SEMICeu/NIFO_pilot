The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><img src="img/35-375.png" alt="35-375.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation.

Possible areas of improvements are particularly concentrated in Principle 9 (Multilingualism) for which the score of 3 shows a medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the country could invest in information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16), so as to reach a higher score in this Principle. </p><img src="img/35-412.x-emf" alt="35-412.x-emf" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Polish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show a strong performance with scores of 3 on interoperability governance and a score of 4 on the other layers. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance. More specifically, the score of 1 for Poland in Recommendation 23, stating that relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level should be consulted when procuring and developing IT solutions, could be improved.</p><img src="img/35-423.x-emf" alt="35-423.x-emf" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Poland’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance, aligned with the European average, in the implementation of recommendations associated with base registries, open data, catalogues, external information sources and services, security and privacy as well as the conceptual model itself. However, there is room for improvement with regard to recommendations associated with internal information sources and services, where Poland’s score of 1 is well below that of the EU average. More specifically, the absence of a shared infrastructure of reusable services and information sources that can be used by all public administrations (Recommendation 36) hinders the overall Polish score with regard to internal information sources and services.</p><p>Additional information on Poland’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle">Strategy for Responsible Development</p><p>The Strategy for Responsible Development for the period up to 2020 (including the perspective up to 2030) determines basic conditions, objectives and directions for the country development in social, economic, environmental and territorial terms for 2020 and 2030. The main objective of the strategy is to create the conditions for an increase in the income of Polish citizens while improving social, economic, environmental and territorial cohesion. The key indicators of the strategy include the growth of Polish GDP per capita up to 95% of the EU28 average by 2030, and a drop in the risk of poverty and social exclusion indicator to 17 by 2030.</p><p>Ensuring a high and stable growth rate will be facilitated by the implementation of the following measures among others:</p><ul><li>Total investment growth to account for 22-25% of the GDP by 2020 and 25% by 2030;</li><li>Increase in the share of research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures to 1.7% of the GDP by 2020 and 2.5% by 2030;</li><li>Average annual growth rate of exports of 7.2% by 2020 and 6.8% by 2030; and</li><li>A 10% share of advanced technology products in total exports by 2020 and 15% by 2030. </li></ul><p>The main objectives include eGovernment measures, particularly those involving the effective use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the public administration. The concept of eGovernment and digital public services implies that high-quality services for citizens, including entrepreneurs, are to be provided by modern information technology (IT) solutions supporting a logical and coherent government IT system, developed and maintained with the cooperation of all actors at various levels of public administration.</p><p>A priority task in the field of eGovernment is to allow the widest possible range of public services to be provided digitally, thereby enabling citizens to handle their businesses remotely. To that end, it will be necessary to ensure the interoperability of public IT systems and to computerise the internal processes of the administration.</p><p>In this field, the strategy sets out the following measures:</p><ul><li>Providing eServices relevant for citizens and entrepreneurs;</li><li>Creating a single information and eServices website for the government administration;</li><li>Introducing a uniform and secure system for identifying citizens (eID) in the eServices systems of the public administration;</li><li>Ensuring a dominant share of digital document flow on administration and economic trade;</li><li>Increasing access to public sector information, including through application programming interfaces (APIs) for software developers;</li><li>Adopting a standard for digital documentation management systems in public administration, guaranteeing an efficient exchange of information with the public administration’s domain-specific systems; and</li><li>Integrating the eGovernment data processing infrastructure and the development of a State register system, ensuring the necessary reliability and availability of eGovernment systems and their integration.</li></ul><p>Other elements link this strategy to the European Commission’s Digital Single Market Strategy, whose implementation is governed and monitored be the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.</p><p>While the implementation of the fundamental objectives of this strategy continues, a certain correction of the specific objectives and mechanisms of the implementation programme has been elaborated in the form of the post-pandemic New Deal Programme, which responds to the changes in the geopolitics and the global economy. The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/polski-lad/polski-lad">programme</a> was announced in the spring of 2021.</p><p class="subtitle">Operational Programme Digital Poland 2014–2020 </p><p>The aim of the Operational Programme (OP) Digital Poland 2014–2020, which is to be implemented until the end of 2023, is to strengthen the foundations for the development of a digital country, including broad access to high-speed internet, efficient and user-friendly public eServices, and an ever-increasing level of digital literacy in society. </p><p>This programme acknowledged that Poland was significantly lagging behind other Member States in the use of the development potential of ICT. In particular, the Council took note of:</p><ul><li>A low fixed broadband coverage;</li><li>A relatively low efficiency of public administration;</li><li>A relatively low level of use of eGovernment; and</li><li>A very low percentage of adults who engage in lifelong learning.</li></ul><p>The report recommended the development of broadband networks, and an improvement in the quality and efficiency of public services through digitalisation. The method for implementing eServices includes mechanisms to prevent the phenomenon of ‘digitalisation bureaucracy’, forcing the positive impact of projects on administrative processes, and to train as many people as possible in the use of ICT to improve their quality of life, also socially, and increase the competitiveness of the labour market. </p><p>By the end of 2021, over 1 000 000 households were connected to high-speed internet. Human capital-related actions resulted in 227 540 people trained in using internet, including eServices, and more than 121 300 acquiring increased digital competences. In the area of eAdministration, 99 new public eServices and 87 new databases accessible through API were provided. </p><p>Under a combination of State and OP Digital Poland budget, the Polish government launched in 2017 the Nationwide Education Network (OSE), an initiative established to provide high-speed internet connections with at least 100 Mb/s symmetrical to all schools and make more eResources available to teachers. The National Act establishing the OSE was adopted and entered into force in December 2017, and in 2018 the first educational centres were connected to the network. As of the beginning of 2021, 90% of schools, over 20 000, had subscribed to OSE services.</p><p>The new edition of the OP Digital Poland for the years 2021–2027, which is named European Funds for Digital Development and is to be implemented until the end of 2030, with a similar thematic scope was adopted by the government in January 2022 and is expecting approval of the European Commission.

The Open Data Programme aims to develop an ecosystem in which a large amount of good quality data will allow for the development of innovative solutions, increase the transparency of the activities of administrative bodies and increase the quality of research, accelerating scientific progress.</p><p>In 2019, as a continuation of the project ‘Open data - access, standard, education’ a new project called Open Data Plus was inaugurated. Under the project, new datasets are released through API and two new tools are established within the Chancellery of the Prime Minister to support the opening of public data, i.e. the Open Data Laboratory (technical and legal advice) and the Open Data Academy (trainings).</p><p class="subtitle">Open Data Standards</p><p>Opening public data makes public administration activities more transparent and allows civic control thereover. In 2018, the former Ministry for Digital Affairs (now the Chancellery of the Prime Minister) published <a href="https://dane.gov.pl/knowledge-base/education/1220">guidelines</a> to prepare and share data for reuse. The guidelines concerned the API standard, the security standard, the technical standard and the legal standard. The Ministry for Digital Affairs elaborated them as part of the project ‘Open data – access, standard, education’ to ensure that data provided by the public administration would be of a higher quality. Open data may now be reused for research or business purposes. </p><p>In 2019, open data standards were subject to extensive public consultations. Most of the proposals submitted during the consultations were implemented in the new versions of the documents published in 2020. This will trigger an increase in the quality of data provided by the administration and used in innovative products and services.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date. </p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Cybersecurity Strategy</p><p>In the course of 2018, Poland created a solid base for strengthening cybersecurity within the country. Then, in October 2019, the Council of Ministers adopted, by means of a resolution, the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WMP20190001037/O/M20191037.pdf">Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019–2024</a>. The State aims to increase the level of resilience to cyber threats and protection of information in the public, military and private sectors, while promoting knowledge and good practices to enable the citizens to protect information better. </p><p>The strategy defines five specific objectives that should be fulfilled by the government: </p><ul><li>Developing the national cybersecurity system (including the adoption of the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act into the Polish legal system); </li><li>Increasing the level of resilience of information systems of the public administration and private sector, and achieving the capacity to effectively prevent and respond to incidents; </li><li>Increasing the national capacity in the area of cybersecurity technology; </li><li>Raising public awareness and competences in the area of cybersecurity; and</li><li>Ensuring the Republic of Poland has a strong international position in the area of cybersecurity.</li></ul><p>The objectives are executed through a dedicated action plan that was consulted within the government in 2020. The action plan identifies mechanisms and measures to strengthen Poland’s cybersecurity capabilities by 2024. Specific actions, responsible entities, key performance indicators and funding were specified in order to implement the strategy. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the action plan has to be updated before it can be adopted by the Council of Ministers. The pandemic showed that there is a need to rethink some previously proposed actions, such as addressing an increasing number of incidents inter alia in the healthcare sector. Moreover, the action plan needs to be fully in line with the actions to be implemented as part of the National Recovery Plan (which is currently expecting to be accepted by the European Commission). </p><p>In addition, the strategy is in line with the obligations laid down in the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive with regard to the adoption of the national cybersecurity strategies by Member States. Lastly, it establishes an effective public-private partnership (Programme for Cooperation in Cybersecurity) with global and national technological companies that aims to strengthen the cooperation in areas such as information sharing on incidents or vulnerabilities, education, cyber hygiene, etc.</p><h3>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>Efficient State Strategy 2020 </p><p>According to the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WMP20130000136">Efficient State Strategy 2020</a>, high interoperability of all IT systems and public registers is a fundamental condition for the implementation of common standards for electronic communication in the public sector and for the provision of reference data for current office work. The possibility of automatic verification of data provided by persons using public services with reference data from public registers will allow to improve the current work of public entities, which are obliged to perform the tasks specified in the law, and at the same time will speed up the settlement of matters. </p><p>The Personal Data Registry (PESEL) shall be a reference set of data about citizens. It is necessary to introduce and enforce principles for limiting to the necessary minimum the range of data which will be required from the citizen when dealing with official matters. Units keeping registers must have the obligation of mutual exchange of information and direct information requests from registered entities should only be possible if the data obtained from other records are insufficient. Since 1 January 2022, government administration bodies, as well as law enforcement bodies, courts, organisational units of the prosecutor’s office, local government units and their bodies that keep a public register using ICT systems have to verify the data entered with the data in PESEL.</p><p>Two-way communication between secondary and primary records (supplied directly with data obtained from the registered entities) should be provided. A modern and secure IT infrastructure, built on robust integrated tele-information systems, is now the basis for the functioning of offices and the exchange of information between offices and citizens, as well as the offices themselves and other public bodies.</p><p>Currently, the government is programming the new Efficient and Modern State Strategy 2030.</p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">eProcurement Project 2020–2026</p><p>The Ministry of Economic Development and Technology is currently working on the development of an eProcurement project in partnership with the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.

An example of joint work by fintech blockchain market stakeholders is the SIRA standardisation platform for a mobile wallet application, which enables shareholders of non-public companies to manage shares registered in various banks.</p><p>Poland is a signatory of the European Blockchain Partnership and participates in the development of the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI), a multi‑country EU project aiming at deploying an energy-efficient, privacy-enhanced and secure blockchain-based infrastructure for providing EU-wide use cases for cross‑border public services, also usable by national and local authorities, and at a later stage by private businesses. The node of the EBSI network is developed in the NASK National Research Institute. </p><h3>Big data </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date. </p><h3>Cloud computing </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date. </p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p class="subtitle">Internet of Things </p><p>In August 2018, the Minister for Digital Affairs launched the Working Group for the Internet of Things (IoT). This initiative attracted more than 150 sector experts drawn from public, business and academic circles. The working group identified key opportunities and articulated the specific role the government must play to encourage a dynamic development of the IoT in Poland. The <a href="http://www.gov.pl/web/digitalization/working-group-for-the-internet-of-things-iot">Report ‘IoT in the Polish economy</a>’ was officially launched in July 2019. </p><p>Then, since January 2020, the group has been focusing on developing projects which support common use of the IoT in the following areas:</p><ul><li>Smart cities and smart homes/buildings;</li><li>Smart agriculture;</li><li>Healthcare system;</li><li>Smart transport;</li><li>Standardisation; and</li><li>Legislation.</li></ul><p>In order to stimulate and encourage local governments, and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to implement IoT solutions, the Chancellery of the Prime Minister has been continuing the activities started in 2019, in particular by:</p><ul><li>Organising a series of seven conferences on the ‘Prospects for IoT development in Poland – Self-Governments of the Future<em>’</em> in cooperation with the Chancellery of the President of Poland (January–June 2020); </li><li>Sharing a one-access-point library with information on a variety of funds available for innovative solutions; and</li><li>Encouraging local governments to contribute to the <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/mapa-innowacji">Map of Innovations in Poland</a> covering examples of application of new technologies (IoT/AI) in local government units, scientific units and/or public administration institutions.</li><li>Additionally, in 2020 the Chancellery analysed - in cooperation with the Ministry for Justice, the Ministry of Finance, the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection, and the Polish Financial Supervision Authority - issues raised by the IoT Working Group relating to the lack of regulations regarding IoT devices liability, especially in B2B and B2A trade relations.</li></ul><h3>High-performance computing</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date. </p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity </h3><p class="subtitle">National Broadband Plan</p><p>The National Broadband Plan (NBP) is the basic document defining the obligations of the government of the Republic of Poland in the field of providing citizens and the economy with access to modern, fast and secure electronic communication services. On 10 March 2020, the document was updated to respond to the challenges facing Poland until 2025 and to organise the activities necessary to meet these challenges - including financial, legislative and intervention measures. The most important activities planned on the basis of the updated NBP are discussed below.</p><p class="subtitle">Connectivity and Information Projects of the Minister for Digital Affairs</p><p>The Minister for Digital Affairs also conducts numerous information activities supporting the development of the network in the country, including by publishing information material on charges for using a road lane in telecommunications investments as well as guides and brochures, such as ‘Construction of telecommunications infrastructure in the road lane. A guide for road managers’ and ‘The Mega-bill and the reduction of costs of building broadband networks’. These publications concern issues related to the Act of 7 May 2010 on Supporting the Development of Telecommunications Services and Networks (the so-called Mega-bill), and the reduction of costs of building broadband networks. They were published on the website of the Ministry and widely distributed among local self-government units and telecommunications undertakings. </p><p>The activities of the Minister also include the popularisation of scientific knowledge on electromagnetic fields (EMFs) emissions. For example, the so-called white paper on EMFs in relation to public health concerns has been published to tackle the growing tide of disinformation in that area. The Ministry is also working on a project co‑financed by the OP Digital Poland aiming to counteract disinformation in the wireless telecommunications environment and to build social acceptance for modern radiocommunication technologies. The project involves the preparation of dedicated training courses as well as information and educational materials for local governments, journalists and the general public. Broad education of selected social groups is considered to be the only effective method in the long term to combat systemic disinformation.</p><h3>Others</h3><p>Special Task Team for Breakthrough Technologies </p><p>The Special Task Team for Breakthrough Technologies was formed on 28 March 2022 by a decision of the chairman of the Council of Ministers Committee for Digital Affairs. The team is to develop and coordinate initiatives encouraging wide-spread deployment of emerging digital technologies both in public administrations and businesses. Some of the activities will be a continuation of existing ones (such as the above-mentioned working groups for AI, IoT and blockchain), while others will be new, including a Safe Quantum Communication Working Group and a Working Group for High-Performance Computing (HPC).</p><img src="img/35-668.jpeg" alt="35-668.jpeg" /><p>	 Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><p>4</p><h1><a id="_Toc34385559"></a>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474962"></a>Specific legislation on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Act on the Computerisation of the Operations of the Entities Performing Public Tasks</p><p>The <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20050640565&amp;type=3">Act on the Computerisation of the Operations of the Entities Performing Public Tasks</a> was adopted by the Sejm on 17 February 2005 and came into force on 21 July 2005 (and was subsequently amended in 2010, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021). It granted citizens and businesses the right to contact public authorities electronically. It also set up horizontal/infrastructure programmes for all sectors of public administration and established a national interoperability framework for IT systems in the Polish public sector. </p><p>This law was essential for the standardisation and interoperability of public administration systems, front and back-office integration of public administration systems, in particular the <a href="https://epuap.gov.pl/wps/portal/english">Electronic Platform of Public Administration Services (ePUAP)</a>, the central repository of electronic document templates, and the supervision and support of IT projects in public administration at both central and local levels. Moreover, it established the public electronic identification (eID) scheme under which two eID means for natural persons are issued. It also enabled citizens to confirm their identity or rights (e.g. for driving licenses) using a mobile device instead of documents intended for this.</p><p>The amendment in 2019 also introduced the System of State Registers as an organisational and technical tool serving public registers. The act obliged the Minister for Digital Affairs to determine technological standards for the System of State Registers, including standards for data exchange between registers. Entities managing public registers are obliged by the act to verify data which are registered for the first time with data in PESEL.</p><p>A new amendment, aimed at introducing the ‘digital by default’ principle in the way the administration operates, is under preparation and is expected to enter into force by the end of 2022. The amendment will set out common rules for public entities including digital documents and electronic communication by default in administration and economy (the primacy of electronic communication), the possibility of using only one means of eID (the principle of one login for every citizen and entrepreneur), the use of one gateway to public services (<a href="https://www.gov.pl/">GOV.PL</a>), as well as solutions limiting data redundancy and data exchange of public ICT systems.</p><p class="subtitle">Act on Electronic Delivery</p><p><a id="_Hlk99958198"></a>The <a href="https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2020/2320">Act on Electronic Delivery</a> was adopted by the Parliament on 18 November 2020 and came into force on 5 October 2021 (with prolonged <em>vacatio legis</em> for some specific provisions). The aim of the act is to set up the Electronic Addresses Register together with its online services, and enable public entities to send and receive as many correspondences as possible within the administration and with citizens and entrepreneurs by means of trust services. As a result, since 5 October 2021 people who express such a statement of will have become able to receive registered correspondence from administration institutions without having to go to the post office. eDelivery is now the legal equivalent to sending a traditional registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt or delivering it in person. </p><p>Along with the adoption of the act, the electronic delivery service standard, based upon ETSI standards, was completed.

These bodies have to officially respond to enquiries within 14 days. Public bodies are also required to proactively publish certain categories of information, i.e. on their policies, legal organisation and principles of operation, the contents of administrative acts and decisions, as well as public assets. The law requires that each of these bodies create a Public Information Bulletin to allow access to information via computer networks. Thus, the official electronic journal for public information – the <a href="https://www.bip.gov.pl/">Public Information Bulletin</a> – was launched in July 2003.</p><p class="subtitle">Regulation on the Manner, Scope and Mode of Access to Data Stored in a Public Register</p><p>The short <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20052051692&amp;type=2">Regulation on the Manner, Scope and Mode of Access to Data Stored in a Public Register</a> sets out the scope and mode of access to data stored in a public register by a public body or entity performing public duties under other regulations or by delegation.

The main goal of the new law is to increase the supply of open data and enable their reuse on a larger scale than before. Moreover, it provides for an easier and less formalised process of accessing information for reuse, as it can be requested in any way and should be provided within 14 days. The reuse of PSI will also be possible via an IT system in real time.</p><p>The act also distinguishes new categories of public sector information, i.e. (i) high‑value data, that is data whose use is associated with significant socio-economic benefits; (ii) dynamic data, that is data that are updated frequently or in real time; and (iii) research data, that is data that are produced or collected as part of research activities financed from public sources.</p><p>Furthermore, the act regulates the functioning of the network of open data officers. They are responsible for improving the quality and increasing the amount of data made available by Ministries, the Central Statistical Office and the Chancellery of the Prime Minister. </p><p>Finally, the act introduces a number of other solutions aimed at building a comprehensive regulatory environment, like formulating the principle of data openness, developing a comprehensive terminology, and regulating standard licenses (e.g. creative commons) or the reuse of source codes when the software is developed as part of a public task.</p><p class="subtitle">Act on the Digital Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies</p><p>The <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WDU20190000848/O/D20190848.pdf">Act on the Digital Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies</a>, setting rules on digital accessibility for persons with disabilities, fully implemented Directive 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2016 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies.

Its purpose is to allow Polish citizens, companies and other entities to identify themselves online in order to access the public eServices using any eID means connected to the national eID node. This was achieved by integrating eID schemes in the national functioning in order to create a single, standardised access point to eID services.</p><p>In 2020, over 300 types of eID means were issued in two eID schemes connected to the national node, i.e. a public scheme provided by the former Ministry for Digital Affairs and MojeID, a private scheme provided by <a href="https://www.kir.pl/en/administration/mojeid/">Krajowa Izba Rozliczeniowa S.A</a>. The public scheme comprised a Trusted Profile – an eID means based on an immaterial unit containing personal identification data and a personal profile – and eID means based on the national ID card. The MojeID scheme comprised eID means issued by eight large domestic banks and 508 small local banks.</p><p class="subtitle">Amendment to the Act on Identity Cards</p><p>The <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20101671131">amendment to the Act on Identity Cards</a> introduced an electronic identity card, a new secure tool enabling eID, and an advanced electronic signature called personal signature. Advanced electronic signatures have to be recognised by public bodies, not only administrative bodies. In a private sector relation, e.g. between client and business, they are recognised if all parties agree. If a user wishes to use the ID card, he/she may include a qualified electronic signature certificate from a trust service provider chosen by the holder. Moreover, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) application was also implemented in the identity card.</p><p class="subtitle">Trust Services</p><p>The <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20160001579">Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification</a> established the <a href="https://www.nccert.pl/"><em>Narodowe Centrum Certyfikacji (</em>NCCert<em>)</em></a>. It is a public centre provided by the Polish National Bank which issues certificates to qualified trust service providers for the verification of advanced electronic signatures or electronic seals as referred to in Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014, a certificates for the verification of other trust services provided by qualified trust service providers. Apart from qualified electronic signatures, two kinds of electronic signatures shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature for public entities: the ‘personal signature’ based on a certificate contained in an electronic chip of the Polish national eID card, and the ‘trusted signature’, i.e. a specific signature which includes a person’s identification data taken from an eID means which is issued under a public eID scheme.  </p><p>Assistance Act</p><p>In connection with the war in Ukraine, Poland has enacted an Assistance Act (<a href="https://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20220000583">Act on Assistance to Citizens of Ukraine in Connection with the Armed Conflict on the Territory of that State</a>).

This legislation defines the national cybersecurity system, as well as the tasks and responsibilities of the entities in the system. The purpose of the national cybersecurity system is to ensure cybersecurity at national level, including the uninterrupted provision of essential services and digital services, by achieving an appropriate level of security involving the information systems used to provide these services and by providing for incident handling. The act also provides for:</p><ul><li>The scope of the Polish National Cybersecurity Strategy;</li><li>The establishment of a single point of contact for cybersecurity run by the Minister competent for digitalisation;</li><li>The establishment of three Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs) at national level and seven competent authorities responsible for cybersecurity within essential sectors in Poland (listed in the annex to the act). Based on the leading role of the three CSIRTs at national level (CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK and CSIRT GOV), the act created a coherent incident response system, with a certain and clear division of constituencies; </li><li>The institution of the Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity, responsible for the coordination of activities and the implementation of the government policy in the field of cybersecurity. It was set up together with an Advisory Committee for Cybersecurity operating at the Council of Ministers in the capacity of a consultative and advisory body in matters of cybersecurity and the relevant activities of CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK, CSIRT GOV, the sectoral cybersecurity teams and the competent authorities for cybersecurity. The Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity and the Advisory Committee ensure the coordination of the cybersecurity system at governmental level; and</li><li>The addition of the public administration to the system with regard to incident handling and reporting.</li></ul><p>The government decided to maintain and develop its decentralised approach towards a governance structure of its cybersecurity system. There is a clear division of responsibilities and capabilities between all the involved institutions established pursuant to the act. That way, the act allowed the creation of an efficient, comprehensive system enabling stakeholders to detect, prevent and mitigate the impact of incidents that affect Polish national interests, while helping crucial societal and economic activities.  </p><p>In this context, Poland has almost completed the identification and designation of operators of essential services. Moreover, effective cooperation and coordination mechanisms are in place. Also, a legal act (secondary legislation) – an ordinance of the Minister for Digital Affairs on organisational and technical conditions for entities providing cybersecurity services and internal organisational structures of operators of essential services responsible for cybersecurity – was amended due to market needs.</p><p>In 2020, a process of amendment of the act was launched and is still ongoing. The new amendment will come into force around June 2022. On the basis of a detailed evaluation of the functioning of the Polish cybersecurity system, new measures will be introduced, inter alia (i) the information sharing mechanism will be updated by establishing Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) within the system; and (ii) the sectoral CSIRTs will be mandatory within the NIS Directive sectors. Moreover, the new law will implement measures provided for by the 5G Toolbox and ensure full alignment with the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act. </p><p class="subtitle">Act on the Protection of Personal Data</p><p>The initial Act on the Protection of Personal Data was adopted on 29 August 1997 and later amended.

Furthermore, it defined cases where transferred data must be supplied with a qualified electronic signature. </p><p>In 2017, the Law on Public Procurement was amended again to include the changes introduced by the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20160001579">Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification</a> of 5 September 2016.</p><p>On 1 January 2021, the new <a href="https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2019/2019">Public Procurement Law</a> came into force. Following the most recent EU Directives on public procurement (2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU), this law provides that all public procurement procedures must be electronic. This obligation applies to all proceedings, regardless of their value. The rules of the new Public Procurement Law take into account the currently applicable solutions for electronic communications. The new solution allows to submit a bid bond in electronic form.</p><p class="subtitle">Act on Electronic Invoicing in Public Procurement, Concessions for Construction Works or Services and Public-Private Partnerships</p><p>Public institutions must be prepared to receive invoices in the form of electronic documents with prescribed structures.

The aim of the Ministry for Digital Affairs was to develop an app that serves as a digital wallet to store documents that are often used by citizens in everyday life, such as ID cards, driver’s licenses, student ID cards, etc., but also to provide services such as up-to-date information about one’s vehicle, information for travellers about other countries or redemption of ePrescriptions. The services provided by mObywatel are the result of cooperation between the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, and many public and private institutions.</p><p>In 2021, additional documents and services were added: the validation of the COVID-19 vaccination document was introduced in March and the EU Digital COVID Certificate, confirming vaccination, a negative COVID-19 test and/or recovery from COVID-19, was also integrated in June, followed by the Lesser Polish Agglomeration Card, the Train Tickets Service, Extended Family and the Railwayman’s ID.</p><p>In 2022, the new Polish Digital COVID Certificate was issued. Furthermore, given the geopolitical situation caused by the war in Ukraine and the large number of refugees who started to arrive in Poland after 24 February, it was decided to create the new service Diia.pl.</p><p>At the end of 2020, the number of application users amounted to over 2 million. As of the beginning of July 2021, the app had been downloaded more than 4 million times, with downloads reaching more than 7 million at the beginning of March 2022.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Trusted Profile</p><p>The Trusted Profile is a public eID means based on an immaterial unit containing personal identification data. It is a special online account provided by the Chancellery of the Prime Minister. This solution can also be used to submit a free online signature in a public service called ‘trusted signature’. This is a specific signature which includes a person’s identification data taken from an eID means which is issued under the public eID scheme. The authenticity and integrity of this signature are ensured by the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, which seals signed data using an advanced electronic seal based on a qualified certificate. </p><p class="subtitle">National Qualified Trust Service Providers</p><p>Poland has five qualified trust service providers active at national level: Asseco Data Systems S.A., Enigma Systemy Ochrony Informacji Sp. z o.o., Eurocert Sp. z o.o., Krajowa Izba Rozliczeniowa S.A. and Polska Wytwórnia Papierów Wartościowych S.A.<em> </em>All of them offer qualified electronic signatures, qualified electronic seals and qualified time stamps according to the eIDAS Regulation. One provider offers qualified validation of signatures and seals, and three others issue qualified website authentication certificates. The overall number of active qualified electronic certificates exceeded 704 758 in January 2021. Non‑qualified trust services are also available (i.e. <a href="https://www.nccert.pl/">advanced electronic signatures and eDelivery</a>).</p><p class="subtitle">ID Card with Electronic Layer</p><p>The eID card is a secure tool containing certificates enabling electronic identification (an eID means called personal profile) and the creation of an advanced electronic signature (called personal signature). It may contain a qualified electronic signature from a trust service provider (chosen by the holder). Moreover, the ICAO application is also implemented in the ID card.</p><p class="subtitle">National Electronic Identification Node</p><p>The <a href="https://login.gov.pl/login/main">National Electronic Identification Node</a> provides convenient access to public portals and eServices. It is an organisational and technical solution that integrates IT systems at a single point in which public online services are made available, with various eID schemes (provided by public or private entities). Users using eID means issued in eID schemes connected to the National Electronic Identification Node can authenticate in any public online services. </p><p>Video Chat as a Form of Identity Authentication </p><p>The first central eService in the form of a video chat was implemented in April 2020. This eService allows people to apply for a Temporary Trusted Profile (TPZ), i.e. a key to digital public administration services in Poland lasting three months, and set up an online appointment with an official without leaving home. During the audiovisual conversation, the official verifies the applicant’s identity document and accepts statements related to the application. The recording of the video-verification, which lasts for several minutes, constitutes a proof of the establishment of a TPZ. </p><p>In 2020, 37 558 TPZs were confirmed via video chat. Due to the popularity of this eService and in order to meet the expectations of citizens, in 2021 identity authentication by means of video-verification became one of the methods to also confirm a traditional Trusted Profile, which is valid for three years. This is a significant step in the development of the Polish system of identity authentication.</p><p class="subtitle">Commercial Certification Authorities Certificates</p><p>Qualified and unqualified certification authorities (CAs) issue electronic identifiers to individual persons. These identifiers are usually Integrated Circuit Cards (ICC) with crypto-controller, private cryptographic keys and public key certificates installed inside or software-based tokens. In the case of eGovernment systems and applications, the most frequently used identifiers are the ones with qualified public key certificates. Electronic signatures with unqualified certificates are rarely used, and their use is mainly limited to message authentication, and authentication of servers, workstations and other IT equipment.</p><p class="subtitle">Commercial eSignatures</p><p>The <a href="https://www.nccert.pl/">National Certification Centre</a> performs the role of the root certification authority for the infrastructure of qualified electronic signatures in Poland, entrusted to the National Bank of Poland by the Ministry for Digital Affairs pursuant to the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20160001579">Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification</a> of 5 September 2016. Currently, in Poland there are five qualified trust service providers. </p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>Public Procurement Office Portal</p><p>Poland’s <a href="http://www.uzp.gov.pl">Public Procurement Office p</a>lays a central role in policymaking and coordination of the entire domestic public procurement system. The launch of the Public Procurement Office Portal (PPO Portal) managed by the <a href="https://www.uzp.gov.pl/">Public Procurement Office</a> has been essential for the functioning of public procurement in Poland. The PPO Portal also contains information and tools aimed at developing the eProcurement system.</p><p class="subtitle">Information on the Polish Public Procurement System</p><p>Poland’s current public procurement system is based on the Law on Public Procurement adopted on 29 January 2004, as subsequently amended. The responsible body for such matters is the President of the Public Procurement Office, assisted in his/her work by the <a href="https://www.uzp.gov.pl/">Public Procurement Office</a>. Entities obliged to follow the Law on Public Procurement include different types of public finance units. They are obliged to award contracts according to the rules of fair competition and equal treatment of economic operators, impartiality and objectivity of those preparing and conducting the procedures specified in the Law on Public Procurement.</p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing Infrastructure</p><p>eInvoicing within the eProcurement area is managed by the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology in cooperation with the Łukasiewicz - Poznań Institute of Technology. The National eInvoicing Platform (PEF) has been operating since 2019, enabling the exchange of eInvoices and other electronic documents in the post-award area. The Ministry of Economic Development and Technology performs the duties of the Peppol Authority and PEF operates within the international Peppol network.</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>Electronic Court Payments</p><p>The <a href="https://oplaty.ms.gov.pl/">Electronic Court Payments</a> is a system that allows users to pay court fees electronically.

The main goal of the project is to increase the effectiveness of public administration’s activities in selected problematic social and economic areas, by supporting decision-making processes with high-quality analytical information. </p><p>The Integrated Analytics Platform is a response to several identified needs, aimed at achieving the following objectives:</p><ul><li>A one-stop shop for analytical tools supporting decision-making processes in public administration;</li><li>Development of data access patterns and analyses for key social and economic areas;</li><li>Creation of technical and organisational opportunities for social dialogue as well as cooperation of scientific communities with regards to the development of State analytics and increased effectiveness of social problem solving;</li><li>Systematisation of technical methods and access guidelines to key State information resources for analytical purposes, along with the implementation of a coherent security system, methods of data access and sharing for analytical purposes; </li><li>Provision of access to public administration data for scientific research supporting decision-making by public policy makers, while ensuring appropriate data protection; and </li><li>Improvement of the digitalisation of public administration in the scope included in the catalogue of recommendations regarding the digitalisation of the administration.</li></ul><p>The objective is to create a common data format, which will make it possible to compare and analyse data, thus enabling public institutions to draw practical conclusions and make strategic decisions. By bringing together big data analytics and market intelligence, the platform will provide tools enabling to make forecasts, develop strategy models and finally make decisions based on reliable data.</p><h2>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>eIDAS Node</p><p>The Polish eIDAS node is connected to the national node and is technically ready to enable the cross-border authentication of a person who has the eID means issued under an eID scheme that has been notified to the European Commission. So far, Polish citizens have been able to use the eID means connected to the national node only in national eServices. Foreign nationals whose eIDAS node is integrated with the Polish eIDAS node can use their notified national eID in selected Polish eServices. </p><p class="subtitle">Single Point of Contact</p><p>The Single Point of Contact is a communication interface (node) between Schengen Member States or associated States. It allows for effective online communication, leading to regular implementation of tasks related to the exchange of cryptographic keys. In general, it will be used to exchange certificates between all countries of the Schengen area, which will enable the competent services (most often the Border Guard) to verify travel documents (usually passports). Suspicious persons (or suspects) will be subject to further verification of fingerprints with imprints placed in the document.</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">System of State Registers </p><p>The System of State Registers combines six registers: PESEL, the Registry of Civil Status, the Registry of ID Cards, the System of State Awards, the Central Registry of Objections and the Registry of Contact Information. The registers in the System of State Registers include referential data which are made available for other registers and exchange information with each other. The interconnections between each of them allow for the provision of new services. </p><p>The System of State Registers is constantly developed and improved. Millions of operations take place annually involving data such as names, surnames, addresses, identity documents, citizenships, marital status, and death and birth date. In 2023, it is planned to include another register in the system, the Passport Document Register. Work has also commenced on the creation of a Central Register of Voters to facilitate the handling of elections. </p><p>Central Register and Information on Economic Activity</p><p>The Central Register and Information on Economic Activity is a business register with information on entrepreneurs running their own business as sole traders (self-employed) in Poland.
