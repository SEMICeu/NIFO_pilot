The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><img src="img/35-681.png" alt="35-681.png" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main components (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Slovakia in 2020. </p><img src="img/35-696.jpeg" alt="35-696.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Slovakia’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF principles. Slovakia meets the European average for every principle, except for Principle 9 (Multilingualism) which obtains a score of 2. The lower-middle performance on this principle indicates that Slovakian public administrations could improve their use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service.  More specifically, the number of language resources and the extent to which public services are broadly available in official EU languages broadly understood by the largest possible number of cross-border users could be improved.</p><img src="img/35-703.jpeg" alt="35-703.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Slovakian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows a very good performance. Slovakia reaches a maximum score of 4, in line with the European average, for all interoperability layers. To maintain this high performance, an area of improvement linked to interoperability governance could be for Slovak public administrations to participate more actively in the standardisation work relevant to the needs of all national public administrations to ensure that their requirements are met (Recommendation 24).</p><img src="img/35-712.jpeg" alt="35-712.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Slovakia’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a very good performance in the implementation of all recommendations. In line with the European average, Slovakia gets a maximal score of 4 for open data, base registries, internal information sources and services and Conceptual Model. Slovakia also obtains a score of 4, surpassing the European average for catalogues, external information sources and services, and security and privacy. The high performance in external and information sources and services, for instance, indicates that Slovak public administrations are effectively using external information sources and services while developing public services. In order to maintain the score of 4 in security and privacy, Slovakia could improve its implementation of the Recommendation 47 on the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services. </p><p>Additional information on Slovakia’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity</strong>: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong>: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services</strong>: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers</strong>: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

Transforming the functioning of public administration organisations and processes is also key, so that such analyses can be effectively used. The action plan also proposes the continuous deployment of fully automated public administration services.

Its main goals are to assess ethical and regulatory framework issues arising from the development, deployment and use of artificial intelligence technologies, as well as preparing opinions on legislation in the field of the ethical aspects of artificial intelligence. The Commission may also comment on draft laws at national level or legislative acts at international level. </p><p>Triple Helix Platforms</p><p>In the near future, Slovakia intends to create State, academic and business consortia in the triple helix model (Triple Helix Platforms), to support the development in such agendas as artificial intelligence or blockchain. Triple Helix platforms should also serve as basic contact points for directly managed projects from EU funds. </p><img src="img/35-911.jpeg" alt="35-911.jpeg" /><p>	</p><p>	Cross-border </p><p>Digital Public Administration Services </p><p>7</p><h1><a id="_Toc34385562"></a>Cross-border Digital Public Administration Services</h1><p>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad.
