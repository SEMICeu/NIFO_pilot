Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 3 (Transparency) and 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) for which the scores of 3 and 2 respectively show a medium to upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the internal visibility and provision of external interfaces for European public services (Principle 3 – Recommendation 5) and the accessibility of public services to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) could be improved in order to reach the maximum score of 4 in corresponding principles.</p><p><img src="img/35-656.x-emf" alt="35-656.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The French results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall good performance with scores of 3 and 4. Potential areas of improvement to foster the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the area of interoperability governance. More specifically, the score of 1 for France in Recommendation 23, stating that relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level should be consulted when procuring and developing ICT solutions, lowers the overall interoperability governance result for France. </p><p><img src="img/35-660.x-emf" alt="35-660.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>France’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a very good performance with a maximum score of 4 in the implementation of recommendations associated with base registries, catalogues, security and privacy, internal information sources and services, the conceptual model itself and open data. Although aligned with the EU average or scoring above it, there is still area for improvement regarding the implementation of the recommendations related to external information sources and services. More precisely, the use of external information sources when developing public services (External information sources and services - Recommendation 45) could be developed further, which would consequently improve the overall French score in Scoreboard 3.</p><p><a id="_Hlk110241295"></a>Additional information on France’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle">Tech.gouv</p><p>On 16 April 2019, the French government launched <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/actualites/tech-gouv-accelerer-la-transformation-numerique-du-service-public/">Tech.gouv</a>, a new programme led by the Interministerial Digital Directorate (DINUM), with the support of all Ministries, which aims to speed up the digital transformation of public services. This agile and collaborative programme aims to help the State seize the opportunities offered by digital technologies to improve public services and bring the administration closer to citizens, businesses and civil servants. Tech.gouv addresses six priority issues: simplification, inclusion, attractiveness, command, economies and alliances. The strategy is structured around eight missions: </p><ul><li>Four missions related to digital products and services to develop new uses (labelling, digital identity, data and infrastructure); and</li><li>Four missions related to the promotion of digital expertise to accelerate public service transformation (pilot, talents, factory and transformation).</li></ul><p>Tech.gouv is accompanied by a three-year action plan centred on 35 priority projects and actions.</p><p class="subtitle">National Strategy for an Inclusive Digital Society</p><p>In September 2018, the <a href="https://societenumerique.gouv.fr/plannational/">National Strategy for an Inclusive Digital Society and the initiative Digital in Common(s)</a> were launched on the occasion of the first event bringing together all actors of digital mediation. The objective is to train 1.5 million people in digital literacy to reduce inequalities and provide equal opportunities for all throughout the country. With 13 million French people who still do not use the internet, or only to a limited extent, including 6.7 million who never connect to the internet, the Government faces a real challenge to carry out the digital transformation of the State. The National Strategy is based on four main approaches:</p><ul><li>Detecting audiences struggling with digital technology;</li><li>Offering human support in the process;</li><li>Training those who wish to do so thanks to the Digital Pass; and</li><li>Strengthening the players in digital mediation.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Public Action 2022 </p><p>The <a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/action-publique-2022-pour-une-transformation-du-service-public">Public Action 2022</a> programme was launched in September 2017 by the French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe, with the aim to modernise the State. The programme has three objectives: (i) improving the quality of public service provided to the user; (ii) improving the working conditions of staff, and (iii) helping to control the budget. To achieve these objectives, the government developed a National Strategy for the Transformation of Public Action, published during the <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/action-publique-2022/actualites/un-2eme-comite-interministeriel-de-la-transformation-publique-ce-quil-faut-retenir">second meeting of the Interministerial Committee for Public Transformation</a> in October 2018. The Strategy includes precise and quantifiable indicators to measure and report on the success of the programme. French citizens will thus be able to monitor the progress of the reforms. The ambition is to have a closer, simpler and more efficient State to better meet citizens' expectations, with transparency in monitoring being a guarantee of the success of reforms.</p><p>The National Strategy is based on four streams guiding the government's action: </p><ul><li>Public services closer to users;</li><li>Simpler and more accessible approaches;</li><li>Clearer and more effective public intervention; and</li><li>A State that transforms itself.</li></ul><p>A considerable part of the action in the field involves digital solutions, thus contributing to the promotion and development of digital government. </p><p>In June 2019, the Prime Minister launched the second part of the initiatives aimed at public transformation, inspired by citizens’ contributions to the ‘<em>Grand débat national’, </em>a public consultation conducted earlier in the year. This second part is centred on three priority commitments: (i) a simpler and more responsive administrative organisation; (ii) closer and more accessible administrations, and (iii) a more efficient administration, able to leverage digital tools for the benefit of end-users, public servants and public policies.</p><p>This over-arching strategy has been implemented by each Ministry through ministerial transformation plans that define the modalities for implementing major government reforms (milestones, achievements and impact indicators). The monitoring of the implementation of these reforms is carried out by the Interministerial Directorate for Public Transformation (DITP), alongside the Offices of the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic, and takes the form of high-level follow-up meetings scheduled at regular intervals. Since the programme’s launch, six Interministerial Committees for Public Transformation have been organised, the latest one having taken place in July 2021, with <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/transformation-publique/comites-interministeriels-de-la-transformation-publique/article-citp">renewed commitments for the State’s digital transformation</a>. </p><p class="subtitle">Ministerial Transformation Plans</p><p>Following the roadmap that the Prime Minister sent to each member of the government at the beginning of his term of office, each Minister has now drawn up a <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/action-publique-2022/plans-de-transformation/les-plans-de-transformation-ministeriels">Ministerial Transformation Plan</a>, for which he/she is responsible, to ensure the implementation of the main reforms. After the design and trade-off phase, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Interministerial Committee for the Transformation of Public Action (CITP) was meant to accelerate the implementation of the Ministries' roadmaps and their Transformation Plans. These plans are monitored at the highest level to ensure that the reforms undertaken are translated into concrete results. The ambition is to have a closer, simpler and more efficient State to better meet citizens' expectations.</p><p class="subtitle">Ministerial Digital Transformation Plans </p><p>As part of the <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/laction-publique-se-transforme/avec-les-administrations-et-les-operateurs-publics/action-publique-2022">Public Action 2022</a> initiative, the Minister for the Armed Forces defined a roadmap in 2017 setting three objectives for the digital transformation of the Ministry:</p><ul><li>Ensure operational superiority and information literacy in theatres of operations;</li><li>Strengthen the efficiency of support and facilitate the daily lives of staff; and</li><li>Improve the relationship with citizens and the attractiveness of the Ministry.</li></ul><p>This Ministerial Digital Transformation Plan was the first to be presented and sets out actions in a concrete way, as the Minister for the Armed Forces reminded: “After four months of work, we are now entering the action phase. This plan offers concrete measures to fully achieve our objectives and address the digital transformation”.</p><p>At the same time, the education system is engaged in profound <a href="https://www.education.gouv.fr/cid133192/le-numerique-service-ecole-confiance.html">pedagogical and organisational transformations</a>, from nursery schools to higher education, requiring to thoroughly take advantage of the potential of digital technology. Digital technology represents a powerful lever for transformation to support ministerial policy in all its dimensions, which are: (i) the pedagogical transformation, digital technology being at the service of learning and evaluation; (ii) training in the challenges and professions of tomorrow; (iii) simplification of relations with users, and (iv) modernisation of the functioning of the State with redesigned information systems. In addition, today, the Ministry of National Education, Youth and Sport produces a very large amount of data related to school life, student assessments and results, and work and homework performed by students. A wide variety of personal digital data is collected, stored and processed by a multitude of actors (schools and educational institutions, academic services, local authorities, and private partners providing educational resources and digital services). In this context, the Ministry must ensure that the flow, processing and storage of school data strictly respects the privacy of students and their families, teachers and administrative staff. </p><p>Digital Transformation of Territories Programme</p><p>In 2021, the <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/services/tnt/#contenu">Digital Transformation of Territories (TNT) programme</a> has replaced the former Concerted Development of Territorial Digital Transformation (DCANT) programme, which ended in 2020. TNT is a cooperation programme between the central government and local authorities to address the challenges of digital transformation within local authorities, and also to support the development of appropriate and efficient public services. This programme, managed by DINUM, includes a series of actions at the national, regional and local levels. It is steered by the Ministry of Public Sector Transformation and the Civil Service, the Ministry for Territorial Cohesion and Relations with Local Government and associations representing local authorities of all sizes and levels.</p><p>In particular, the programme allows for the emergence of common tools and concrete solutions that can be reused by all local levels wishing to move forward on digital. These tools and solutions are co-constructed within project groups led by the central government and local authorities and address various digital transformation issues (data, cybersecurity, training of elected officials in digital issues, dematerialization projects that are the responsibility of local authorities, etc.). These project groups deal with digital issues in a cross-cutting manner and take into account all regulatory obligations and potential organizational and technical issues.</p><p class="subtitle">Government Roadmap for the Digital Economy</p><p>Following a workshop on the digital economy organised on 28 February 2013, the government presented the Government Roadmap for the Digital Economy. This strategy revolves around three pillars, namely: ‘Providing opportunities for youth’, ‘Reinforcing competitiveness’, and ‘Promoting French values in society’.</p><p><strong>Providing opportunities for Youth</strong></p><p>Four objectives were defined under this pillar:</p><ul><li>Using digital tools to rethink education in schools, i.e. ensure that all students leaving school are familiar with digital tools, have followed courses in information and media, and are aware of the historical, cultural, artistic, economic and social challenges brought about by the information society;</li><li>Creating more digitally accessible universities, i.e. ensure that distance learning programmes and diplomas can be obtained in all fields where this is possible, and that 20% of educational programmes are available through digital means;</li><li>Promoting ICT related jobs, as to increase the number of graduates obtaining ICT related degrees by at least 3,000 per year; and</li><li>Reinforcing awareness-raising campaigns. </li></ul><p><strong>Reinforcing competitiveness</strong></p><p>Four objectives were defined under this pillar:</p><ul><li>Encouraging the development of global digital companies;</li><li>Encouraging research and innovation;</li><li>Guaranteeing digital take-up for the entire economy; and</li><li>Developing a 21<sup>st</sup> century infrastructure. </li></ul><p><strong>Promoting French values in society</strong></p><p>Six objectives were defined under this pillar:</p><ul><li>Encouraging the use of digital tools to tackle exclusion;</li><li>Protecting French sovereignty and establishing a trustful environment for citizens;</li><li>Defining a new digital pact to promote cultural activities;</li><li>Modernising public policy through the use of digital tools and resources;</li><li>Promoting the use of digital means in the health sector; and</li><li>Responding to cyberspace-related challenges.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">‘State Start-up’ Strategy</p><p>Since 2013, the <a href="https://beta.gouv.fr/">Beta.gouv mission/programme</a> within DINUM has been helping French administrations design useful and easily usable digital public services. The method proposed by the programme is based on two pillars:</p><ul><li>Developing digital services centred on users' needs and continuously improving them based on the feedback received from those who used the service; and</li><li>Supporting civil servants with strong business expertise to project themselves as product managers and, accompanied by a small technical team (1 or 2 developers maximum), to directly manage the development of digital-native public policies. </li></ul><p>This process, called the <a href="https://www.fondapol.org/etude/pierre-pezziardi-et-henri-verdier-des-startups-detat-a-letat-plateforme/">‘State Startup’ method</a>, is an adaptation of the ‘Lean Startup’ method, which is popular in entrepreneurial circles, to public administrations. It is an interesting alternative to the traditional IT development cycle (known as the "Waterfall cycle"), allowing for a more exploratory approach and prioritising the search for impact. This method is particularly suited for the creation of digital services for individuals. Supported by DINUM, this method has spread to various administrations, which have gradually created digital service "incubators" and set up various actions to identify civil servants who volunteer to take on the role of ‘digital entrepreneurs’ and/or to identify public policy problems that can be addressed by creating impact-oriented digital services. </p><p>The Beta.gouv programme is now a genuine network of digital innovators within the State, trained in ‘lean product management’ methods and contributing to a collective learning community. There are now 16 such incubators, dealing with business issues as diverse as those encountered by the Ministry for the Armed Forces, the Ministry of Justice, the French Employment Agency (Pôle Emploi) and the National Agency for Territorial Cohesion (to name just four partner institutions). </p><p>The Beta.gouv community, the backbone of the programme, reached 800 members in 2022.

With this doctrine, cloud computing has become the default hosting and production mode for the State's digital services, for all new digital products and for products undergoing a substantial evolution. The State’s digital services must now be hosted on one of the two internal interministerial public clouds or on cloud solutions provided by private companies that satisfy strict security criteria. Indeed, the objective of this doctrine is to ensure the State’s sovereignty, the continuity of public services and data protection for citizens. A specific team was set up within DINUM to accompany administrations in making cloud computing a major tool for a quality digital transformation and to animate a community of public actors on this topic.

The PACTE has two objectives: making companies grow so that they create more jobs and redefining the place of companies in society to better involve employees. From creation to transfer, the PACTE removes obstacles, simplifying business creation and easing workforce thresholds. In particular, entrepreneurs’ lives will be simplified thanks to the creation of a single online platform for business formalities. The PACTE is a new step in the country's economic transformation and the fourth phase of the economic reforms initiated by the government more than two years ago.

Moreover, the PACTE acts in parallel with the Law on the Freedom to Choose One's Professional Future to give small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the means to create jobs. The PACTE is the result of a co-construction process initiated with companies, parliamentarians, and local authorities in October 2017.

This <a href="https://api.gouv.fr">catalogue of APIs</a> is primarily intended for service creators and API consumers and aims to facilitate the discovery and understanding of APIs, and the access to APIs and their producers. At the same time, the catalogue enables suppliers to easily publicise their APIs. </p><p>Administrations often consume several APIs (from different producers) to implement a teleservice or a new approach. The use of an interdepartmental tool allows them to ensure consistency in the authorisation procedure and centralise their requests.</p><p>To facilitate the lives of data providers, DINUM developed a specific tool to manage the authorisation phase, called ‘DataPass’. Furthermore, DINUM created two API hubs, namely <a href="https://entreprise.api.gouv.fr/">API Enterprise</a> and <a href="https://api.gouv.fr/les-api/api-particulier">API Particulier</a>.</p><p><strong>DataPass</strong></p><p>DINUM worked on setting up a common legal framework to harmonise and streamline relations between data providers and service providers through the construction of DataPass, a tool facilitating the connection between suppliers and consumers. This tool is intended for stakeholders (e.g. public administrations) who wish to use personal data. DataPass delivers authorisations through a simple, standardised and compliant process, to access all protected data produced by the State.</p><p>For the stakeholders requesting access to data, DataPass contains the following features: </p><ul><li>APIs centralising authorisations stemming from public administrations (available as well for any other type of organisations, both public and private);</li><li>Single account to access API managers and request access to the DataPass tool (SSO);</li><li>Management of authorisations to access API; and</li><li>Email notification from the Data Protection Officer and the data controller of the users’ organisation when a request has been validated.</li></ul><p>For the data controller:</p><ul><li>Email notification for each new access request;</li><li>Automation of the creation of API manager access accounts;</li><li>Automation of token creation through interaction with the API manager;</li><li>Publication of validated authorisations on <a href="https://datapass.api.gouv.fr/public">DataPass</a> in accordance with the GDPR; and</li><li>Activity management / <a href="https://datapass.api.gouv.fr/stats">statistical dashboard</a>. </li></ul><p><strong>API Entreprise</strong></p><p>Digital technology enables the pre-filling and digitisation of administrative forms that businesses are required to complete, in particular to enable the exchange of information between the different departments and agencies. Since 2014 two projects have been running in the framework of the inter-ministerial programme.</p><p>Public administrations can access this information through APIs (<a href="https://api.apientreprise.fr/documentation">API Entreprise</a>) that provide information from different base registries. The base registries that are made available through the APIs are:</p><ul><li>INSEE (administrative information / contact details and identity);</li><li>Info-Greffe (legal information / legal status);</li><li>INPI (legal acts / business acts);</li><li>Ministry in charge of Social Affairs (collective agreements);</li><li><em>Chambre des métiers et de l’Artisanat</em> (CMA) France (handicraft enterprise information);</li><li>ADEME (energy certificates);</li><li>DGFiP (fiscal information / taxation / turnover);</li><li>ACOSS &amp; MSA (social situation / social security contributions);</li><li>Customs (economic operator registration and identification); and</li><li><em>Caisses retraites</em> (pension funds).</li></ul><p>The API Enterprise hub aims to centralise company information owned by French administrations (General Directorate of Public Finance, Companies Register, Associations Register, etc.) to help administrative service providers to develop simplified online procedures, e.g. public procurement applications or requests for public subsidies.

DINUM performs the technical interfacing with the different APIs within standards that are up-to-date with industrial constraints. Public service providers just have to deal with a single account and a single contact to access multiple data to develop online public services.</p><p>For instance, the API hub helps administrations to simplify and improve administrative online processes such as scholarship applications. In this case, families’ incomes were directly retrieved from tax centres. In September 2018, the French administration received 650,000 successful calls, corresponding to as many supporting documents that did not need to be produced. This saves time for families: in the past, some parents had to take half a day off work to submit their applications, others to ask their children to queue during recess.<strong> </strong>Today, to replace a supporting document with a call to API Particulier users must still enter specific information to the administration, such as tax number or beneficiary number. The French administration would like users to be able to identify themselves more easily through <a href="https://franceconnect.gouv.fr/">FranceConnect</a>.<strong> </strong>Thus, with a single login and password, the API hub would allow everyone to simplify their procedures. </p><p class="subtitle">ePassports</p><p>In April 2006, the Ministry of Interior announced the calendar for the introduction of the first <a href="https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N360">electronic passports</a> in France, progressively introduced between April and July 2006. Embedded with a contact-less chip, the French ePassport contains the digitalised photograph of its owner. ePassports are intended to be more than a simple travel document and in the future could be used for the fulfilment of administrative formalities. On 28 June 2009, electronic passports were replaced by biometric passports containing also the holder’s digitised fingerprints.</p><p class="subtitle">FranceConnect</p><p>In 2016, France launched a digital identity federator called ‘<a href="https://franceconnect.gouv.fr/"><em>France Connect</em></a>’ in order to simplify access to public and private services for French citizens. It relies on pre-existing accounts widely used by French citizens such as health insurance accounts, tax administration accounts, the digital identity proposed by the French postal service, etc. At this stage, 35 million people use it on a regular basis to connect to over 1 500 online services, both public and private (mostly banking and insurance services for the private sector).

With this doctrine, cloud computing has become the default hosting and production mode for the State's digital services, for all new digital products and for products undergoing a substantial evolution. The State’s digital services must now be hosted on one of the two internal interministerial public clouds or on cloud solutions provided by industrials satisfying strict security criteria. Indeed, the objective of this doctrine is to ensure the State’s sovereignty, the continuity of the public services and data protection for citizens. A specific team was set up within DINUM to accompany administrations in making cloud computing a major tool for a quality digital transformation and to animate a community of public actors on this topic. This team works closely with the French Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) in order to ensure a secure environment for the use of cloud computing technology by the French State. </p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-performance computing</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><p><img src="img/35-924.jpeg" alt="A picture containing text, computer, person, indoor
