The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><img src="img/35-680.png" alt="35-680.png" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Poland in 2020. </p><p>	</p><img src="img/35-690.jpeg" alt="35-690.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Poland’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality). Possible areas of improvements are particularly concentrated in Principle 9 (Multilingualism) for which the score of 2 shows a medium to low performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the country should invest in information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16), so as to reach a higher score in this Principle. </p><img src="img/35-697.jpeg" alt="35-697.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Polish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show a strong performance with scores of 4 in each layer. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance. More specifically, the score of 1 for Poland in Recommendation 23, stating that relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level should be consulted when procuring and developing IT solutions, could be improved.</p><img src="img/35-707.jpeg" alt="35-707.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Poland’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with base registries, open data, external information sources and services, security and privacy as well as the conceptual model itself. However, there is room for improvement with regard to recommendations associated with internal information sources and services, where Poland’s score of 1 is well below that of the EU average. More specifically, the absence of a shared infrastructure of reusable services and information sources that can be used by all public administrations (Recommendation 36) hinders the overall Polish score with regard to internal information sources and services.</p><p>Additional information on Poland’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The main objective of the strategy is to create the conditions for an increase in the income of Polish citizens while increasing social, economic, environmental and territorial cohesion. The key indicators of the strategy include the GDP per capita growth up to 95% of EU28 by 2030 and a drop in the risk of poverty and social exclusion indicator to 17 by 2030.</p><p>Ensuring a high and stable growth rate will be facilitated by the implementation of the following measures among others:</p><ul><li>Total investment growth to account for 22-25% of the GDP by 2020 and 25% by 2030;</li><li>Increase in the share of R&amp;D expenditures to 1.7% of the GDP by 2020 and 2.5% by 2030;</li><li>Average annual growth rate of exports of 7.2% by 2020 and 6.8% by 2030;</li><li>A 10% share of advanced technology products in total exports by 2020 and 15% by 2030. </li></ul><p>The main objectives include eGovernment measures, particularly those involving the effective use of ICT in the public administration. </p><p>The concept of eGovernment and digital public services imply that high-quality services for citizens, including entrepreneurs, are to be provided by modern IT solutions supporting a logical and coherent government IT system, developed and maintained with the cooperation of all actors at various levels of public administration.</p><p>A priority task in the field of eGovernment is to allow the widest possible range of public services to be provided digitally, thereby enabling citizens to handle their businesses remotely. It will be necessary to ensure the interoperability of public IT systems and to computerise the internal processes of the administration.</p><p>This strategy sets out the following measures:</p><ul><li>Providing eServices relevant for citizens and entrepreneurs;</li><li>Creating a single information and eServices website for the government administration;</li><li>Introducing a uniform and secure system for identifying citizens (eID) in the eServices systems of the public administration;</li><li>Ensuring a dominant share of digital document flow on administration and economic trade;</li><li>Increasing access to public sector information, including through interfaces for software developers;</li><li>Adopting a standard for digital documentation management systems in public administration, guaranteeing an efficient exchange of information with the public administration’s domain-specific systems;</li><li>Integrating the eGovernment data processing infrastructure and the development of a State register system, ensuring the necessary reliability and availability of eGovernment systems and their integration.</li></ul><p>There are other elements linking this strategy to the EC’s Digital Single Market Strategy, whose implementation is governed and monitored be the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.</p><p>While the implementation of the fundamental objectives of this strategy continues, a certain correction of the specific objectives and mechanisms of the implementation programme has been elaborated in the form of the post-pandemic New Deal Programme, which responds to the changes in the geopolitics and the global economy. <a href="http://www.kprm.gov.pl/">The programme</a> was announced in the spring of 2021.</p><p class="subtitle">Operational Programme Digital Poland 2014-2020 </p><p>The aim of the Operational Programme Digital Poland 2014-2020, which is to be implemented until the end of 2023, is to strengthen the foundations for the development of a digital country, including broad access to high-speed internet, efficient and user-friendly public eServices and the ever-increasing level of digital literacy in society. This programme acknowledged that Poland was significantly lagging behind other Member States in the use of the development potential of information and communication technology (ICT). </p><p>In particular, the Council took note of:</p><ul><li>Low fixed broadband coverage;</li><li>Relatively low efficiency of public administration;</li><li>Relatively low level of use of eGovernment;</li><li>Very low percentage of adults who engage in lifelong learning.</li></ul><p>The report recommended the development of broadband networks and the improvement in the quality and efficiency of public services through digitalisation. The method for implementing eServices includes mechanisms to prevent the phenomenon of ‘digitalisation bureaucracy’, forcing the positive impact of projects on administrative processes, and to train as many people as possible in the use of ICT to improve their quality of life, also socially, and increase the competitiveness of the labour market. By the end of 2020, 580 000 households were connected to high-speed internet. Human capital related actions resulted in 227 540 people trained in using internet, including eServices and more than 121 300 acquiring increased digital competences. In the area of eAdministration, 99 new public eServices and 87 new databases accessible through API were provided. </p><p>Under a combined State budget with OP Digital Poland, the Polish government launched in 2017 the Nationwide Education Network, an initiative established to provide high-speed internet connections with at least 100 Mb/s symmetrical to all schools and make more eResources available to teachers. The National Act establishing the National Educational Network was adopted and entered into force in December 2017. In 2018, the first educational centres were connected to the Network. At the beginning of 2021, 90% of schools, almost 16 thousand, have subscribed to OSE services.</p><p>The new edition of the OP Digital Poland for the years 2021-2027, which is to be implemented until the end of 2030, with a similar thematic scope is currently under preparation. It will contain the following components: broad access to ultra-fast internet, implementation of advanced and user-friendly public eServices, digital cross-sector cooperation, effective operation of the national cybersecurity system, support for digital skills of employees of public institutions, digital availability and reuse of PSI (Public Sector Information).</p><p class="subtitle">National Integrated Informatisation Programme</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/program-zintegrowanej-informatyzacji-panstwa">National Integrated Informatisation Programme (PZIP)</a> was adopted in January 2014.

The guidelines concerned the Application Programming Interface (API) standard, the security standard, the technical standard, and the legal standard. In 2018, the Ministry of Digital Affaires elaborated them to ensure that data provided by the public administration would be of a higher quality. Public open data standards for the administration were developed as part of the project ‘Open data – access, standard, education’. Open data may now be reused for research or business purposes. Opening public data makes public administration activities more transparent and allows civic control thereover. </p><p>In 2019, open data standards were subject to extensive public consultations. Most of the proposals submitted during the consultations were implemented in the new versions of the documents published in 2020.

In October 2019, the Council of Ministers adopted, by means of a resolution, the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WMP20190001037/O/M20191037.pdf">Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Poland for 2019-2024</a>. The State aims to increase the level of resilience to cyber threats and protection of information in the public, military and private sectors, while promoting knowledge and good practices to enable the citizens to protect information better. </p><p>The strategy defines five specific objectives that should be fulfilled by the government: </p><ul><li>Developing the national cybersecurity system (including the adoption of the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act into the Polish legal system); </li><li>Increasing the level of resilience of information systems of the public administration and private sector, and achieving the capacity to effectively prevent and respond to incidents; </li><li>Increasing the national capacity in the area of cybersecurity technology; </li><li>Raising public awareness and competences in the area of cybersecurity; </li><li>Ensuring the Republic of Poland has a strong international position in the area of cybersecurity.</li></ul><p>The objectives are executed through a dedicated action plan that was consulted within the government in 2020. In order to implement the strategy, specific actions, responsible entities, key performance indicators and funding were specified. The action plan identifies mechanisms and measures to strengthen Poland’s cybersecurity capabilities by 2024. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the action plan has to be updated before it can be adopted by the Council of Ministers. The pandemic showed that there is a need to rethink some previously proposed actions, such as addressing an increasing number of incidents inter alia in the healthcare sector. Moreover, the action plan needs to be fully in line with the actions to be implemented as part of the National Recovery Plan. </p><p>In addition, its strategy is in line with the obligations laid down in the NIS Directive with regard to the adoption of the national cybersecurity strategies by Member States. Lastly, it establishes an effective public-private partnership (Programme for Cooperation in Cybersecurity) with global and national technological companies that aims at strengthening the cooperation in areas such as information sharing on incidents or vulnerabilities, education, cyber hygiene, etc.</p><h3>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>Efficient State Strategy 2020 </p><p>According to the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WMP20130000136">Efficient State Strategy 2020</a>, high interoperability of all IT systems and public registers is a fundamental condition for the implementation of common standards for electronic communication in the public sector and for providing reference data for current office work. The possibility of automatic verification of data provided by persons using public services with reference data from public registers will allow to improve the current work of public entities, which are obliged to perform the tasks specified in the law, and at the same time will speed up the settlement of matters. </p><p>The PESEL (Personal Data Register) shall be a reference set of data about citizens. It is necessary to introduce and enforce principles for limiting to the necessary minimum the range of data which will be required from the citizen when dealing with official matters. Units keeping registers must have the obligation of mutual exchange of information, and direct information requests from registered entities should only be possible if the data obtained from other records are insufficient. From 1 January 2022, government administration bodies and law enforcement bodies, courts, organisational units of the prosecutor’s office, local government units and their bodies that keep a public register using ICT systems will have to verify the data entered with the data in the PESEL.</p><p>Two-way communication between secondary and primary records (supplied directly with data obtained from the registered entities) should be provided. A modern and secure IT infrastructure, built on robust integrated tele-information systems, is now the basis for the functioning of offices and the exchange of information between offices and citizens, as well as the offices themselves and other public bodies. Currently, the government is programming the new Efficient and Modern State Strategy 2030.</p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">eProcurement Project 2020-2026</p><p>The Ministry of Development, Labour and Technology is currently working on an eProcurement project in partnership with the Chancellery of the Prime Minister.

Projects developed under the programme aim to provide both educational as well as technical solutions facilitating the implementation of AI in all sectors of the economy, with particular focus on the use of AI in public administration in order to improve the quality of services offered to citizens and businesses. </p><p>The overall implementation efforts are coordinated by a task force headed by the Prime Minister’s High Representative for Government Technology. </p><p>As part of the AI Policy, Poland has been in the process of establishing an ecosystem for AI governance which involves nominating the Task Force for Enforcement of AI Policy, linked to the Chancellery of the Prime Minister. The Task Force, representing all ministries and relevant national agencies, will ensure effective coordination of the AI policy implementation process in strategic sectors. Its task is also to prepare the AI Operational Programme. </p><p class="subtitle">Internet of Things </p><p>In August 2018, the Minister for Digital Affairs launched the Working Group for the Internet of Things (IoT). This initiative attracted more than 150 sector experts drawn from public, business and academic circles. The working group identified key opportunities and articulated the specific role government must play to encourage a dynamic development of IoT in Poland. The <a href="http://www.gov.pl/web/digitalization/working-group-for-the-internet-of-things-iot">Report ‘IoT in the Polish economy</a>’ was officially launched in July 2019. </p><p>Since January 2020, the Group has been focusing on developing projects which support common use of IoT in the following areas:</p><ul><li>Smart cities and smart homes/buildings;</li><li>Smart agriculture;</li><li>IoT in the healthcare system;</li><li>Smart transport;</li><li>Standardisation;</li><li>Legislation.</li></ul><p>In order to stimulate and encourage local governments and SMEs to implement IoT solutions, the Chancellery of the Prime Minister continued the activities started in 2019. These in particular include:</p><ul><li>A series of seven conferences on the ‘<em>Prospects for IoT development in Poland – Self-Governments of the Future’</em> organised in co-operation with the Chancellery of the President of Poland (January–June 2020); </li><li>Sharing a one-access-point library with information on a variety of funds available for innovative solutions;  </li><li>Encouraging local governments to contribute to <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/cyfryzacja/mapa-innowacji">the Map of Innovations in Poland</a> covering examples of application of new technologies (IoT/AI) in local government units, scientific units and/or public administration institutions.</li><li>Additionally, in 2020 the Chancellery analysed - in co-operation with the Ministry for Justice, the Ministry of Finance, the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection and the Polish Financial Supervision Authority - issues raised by the IoT Working Group relating to lack of regulations regarding IoT devices liability, esp. B2B and B2A trade relations.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Blockchain</p><p>The Working Group on DLT/Blockchain gathers a wide representation of blockchain market stakeholders. They are interested in ensuring adequate conditions for the development of blockchain solutions in various sectors of the economy, as well as in the public sector, by identifying market areas where State involvement might be both expected and necessary.</p><p>It serves as a platform for cross-sectoral cooperation, where different points of view, interests, as well as legal, regulatory, organisational and cultural conditions can be explored and discussed. This has already become an opportunity to expand the field of debate and support discussions of specialised financial market regulators on the Capital Market Development Strategy or fintech. The works resulted in <a href="https://www.gov.pl/web/digitalization/working-group-on-dlt-and-blockchain">four white papers</a> published in March 2020: Token as Bond, Electronic Promissory Notes and Bills of Exchange – Blockchain, Electronic Seal in business transactions, GDPR and Blockchain.</p><p> </p><p>Similar fields of debate arise and will be developed in other markets where the State can help through regulation, law or pilot implementation: real estate, energy and supply chain. The working group also prepared legislative proposals on these matters, as well as a common legal position for the use of fintech barriers discussed within the Financial Regulatory Authority. Works were also undertaken on the standardisation for blockchain applications in the finance sector.</p><p>Poland is a signatory of the European Blockchain Partnership and participates in the development of the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI), a multi‑country EU project aiming at deploying an energy-efficient, privacy-enhanced, secure blockchain-based infrastructure for providing EU-wide cross-border public services, also usable by national and local authorities, and by private businesses at a later stage. Poland also supports the Government Advisory Body of the International Association of Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA), whose aspiration is to create a standardisation and policy platform for the development of blockchain applications.</p><img src="img/35-856.jpeg" alt="35-856.jpeg" /><p>	 Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><p>4</p><h1><a id="_Toc34385559"></a>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474962"></a>Specific legislation on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Act on the Computerisation of the Operations of the Entities Performing Public Tasks</p><p>The <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20050640565&amp;type=3">Act on the Computerisation of the Operations of the Entities Performing Public Tasks</a> was adopted by the Sejm on 17 February 2005 and came into force on 21 July 2005 (this legislation was subsequently amended in 2010, 2014, 2016, 2018 and 2019). It granted citizens and businesses the right to contact public authorities electronically. It set up horizontal/infrastructure programmes for all sectors of public administration and established a national interoperability framework for IT systems in the Polish public sector. </p><p>This law was essential for the standardisation and interoperability of public administration systems, front and back-office integration of public administration systems, in particular the <a href="https://epuap.gov.pl/wps/portal/english">Electronic Platform of Public Administration Services (ePUAP)</a>, the central repository of electronic document templates, and the supervision and support of IT projects in public administration at both central and local levels. Moreover, it established the public electronic identification scheme under which two electronic identification means for natural persons are issued. It also enabled citizens to confirm their identity or rights (e.g. for driving licenses) using a mobile device instead of documents intended for this.</p><p>The last amendment in 2019 also introduced in the law the System of State Registers as an organisational and technical tool serving public registers. The act obliged the Minister of Digital Affairs to determine technological standards for the System of State Registers, including standards for data exchange between registers. The entities managing public registers are obliged by the act to verify data which are registered for the first time with data in the Personal Register Data (PESEL).</p><p>A new amendment is under preparation aiming at introducing digital default to the way the administration operates. The amendment will set out common rules for public entities including digital documents and electronic communication by default in administration and economy (the primacy of electronic communication), the possibility of using only one means of electronic identification (the principle of one login for every citizen and entrepreneur), the use of one gateway to public services (<a href="https://www.gov.pl/">GOV.PL</a>), as well as solutions limiting data redundancy and data exchange of public ICT systems.

The aim of the act is to enable public entities to provide as many electronic services as possible within the administration and to introduce solutions ensuring the exchange of registered correspondence with citizens and entrepreneurs by means of the trust services. As a result, from 1 July 2021 people who express such a wish will be able to receive registered correspondence from administration institutions without having to go to the post office. eDelivery will be the legal equivalent to sending a traditional registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt or delivering in person. Along with the adoption of the Act, the electronic delivery service standard was completed. This is the document standardising the manner of providing these services by service providers, including the designated operator. The registered electronic delivery standard has been published on the <a href="https://mc.bip.gov.pl/ogloszenia/standard-publicznej-uslugi-rejestrowanego-doreczenia-elektronicznego-swiadczonej-przez-operatora-wyznaczonego-i-kwalifikowanych-dostawcow-uslug.html">BIP website of the Ministry of Digital Affairs</a>.</p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474963"></a>Regulation on the National Interoperability Framework</p><p>The <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/download.xsp/WDU20170002247/O/D20172247.pdf">Regulation on the National Interoperability Framework</a>, minimum requirements for public registers and information exchange in electronic form and minimum requirements for ICT systems, adopted on 12 April 2012 by the Council of Ministers, was further amended in 2014, 2016 and 2017. </p><p class="subtitle">Act on the Computerisation of the Operations of the Entities Performing Public Tasks</p><p>Since the beginning of 2021, the Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland has been working on the amendment to the <a href="http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20050640565">Act on the Computerisation of Entities Performing Public Tasks.</a> The amended act will set out provisions related to e.g. reference data, interoperability recommendations, interoperability repository, thus recognising the importance of interoperability key concepts and definitions that are currently defined in the Regulation on the Polish National Interoperability Framework.

The bodies had to officially respond to enquiries within 14 days. Public bodies were required to publish information on their policies, legal organisation and principles of operation, the contents of administrative acts and decisions, as well as public assets. The law required that each of these bodies create a Public Information Bulletin to allow access to information via computer networks. Thus, the official electronic journal for public information – the <a href="https://www.bip.gov.pl/">Public Information Bulletin</a> – was launched in July 2003.</p><p>This <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20112041195">law</a> was a synthetic presentation of the current state of social relations in the field of the reuse of public information. The law introduced the following main amendments: </p><ul><li>It introduced the obligation to provide public information on the objectives of reuse, while the directive left discretion to the Member States in this area;</li><li>It significantly improved the process of obtaining reused public information, by abolishing the need to submit applications when public information was already published on the <a href="http://www.bip.gov.pl/">Public Information Bulletin</a>;</li><li>It granted applicants the right to sue not only for refusal to provide public information for reuse, but also for conditions of use which might violate the law.</li></ul><p>Poland amended the Act on Access to Public Information in 2010, fully transposing into national law <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0098:EN:HTML">Directive 2003/98/EC of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public sector information (PSI)</a>. </p><p class="subtitle">Regulation on the Manner, Scope and Mode of Access to Data Stored in a Public Register</p><p>This <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20052051692&amp;type=2">short regulation</a> set out the scope and mode of access to data stored in a public register, by a public body or entity performing public duties under other regulations or by delegation.

The draft of the Act on Open Data and the Re-use of Public Sector Information (which implements Directive 2019/1024) has been drawn up and will be submitted for adoption by Parliament in the coming months. This draft law aims at increasing the supply of valuable public data for reuse. The introduced changes enlarge the scope of the act to data held by public undertakings and research data resulting from public funding that has already been made available in a publicly available ICT system. Moreover, the draft law provides for an easier and less formalised process of accessing information for reuse as information can be requested in any way, and it should be provided within 14 days.

The act was adopted on 5 September 2016 and then amended in 2018, 2019 and 2020.</p><p>The 2018 amendment established the availability of electronic services in Poland through a national node, which is an organisational and technical solution that integrates at a single point all ICT systems in which public online services are made available, with various electronic identification schemes (provided by public or private entities). Users who use electronic identification means issued in electronic identification schemes connected to the national electronic identification node can authenticate in any public online services.</p><p class="subtitle">Polish National Electronic Identification (eID) Scheme</p><p>Poland aligned its national legal system with the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">eIDAS Regulation</a> through the adoption of the <a href="http://isap.sejm.gov.pl/DetailsServlet?id=WDU20160001579">Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification</a>. </p><p>With this act the Polish National Electronic Identification scheme was established. Its purpose is to allow Polish citizens, companies and other entities to identify themselves online in order to access the public electronic services using any electronic identification means connected to the national node of electronic identification. This was achieved by integrating eID schemes in the national functioning in order to create a single, standardised access point to eID services.</p><p>In 2020, over three hundred types of electronic identification means were issued in two electronic identification schemes connected to the national node: a public scheme provided by the former Ministry of Digital Affairs and MojeID, a private scheme provided by <a href="https://www.kir.pl/en/administration/mojeid/">Krajowa Izba Rozliczeniowa S.A</a>. A public scheme comprised a trusted profile – an electronic identification means based on an immaterial unit containing personal identification data and a personal profile – and electronic identification means based on the national ID card. The MojeID scheme comprised electronic identification means issued by three large domestic banks and 329 small local banks.</p><p class="subtitle">Amendment to the Act on Identity Cards</p><p>The <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20101671131">amendment to the Act on Identity Cards</a> introduced an electronic identity card, a new secure tool enabling electronic identification and an advanced electronic signature called personal signature. Advanced electronic signatures have to be recognised by public bodies, not only administrative bodies. In a private sector relation, e.g. between client and business, it is recognised if all parties agree. If a user wishes to use the ID card, he/she may include a qualified electronic signature certificate from a trust service provider chosen by the holder. Moreover, the ICAO application was also implemented in the identity card.</p><p class="subtitle">Trust services</p><p>The <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20160001579">Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification</a> established the <a href="https://www.nccert.pl/"><em>Narodowe Centrum Certyfikacji (</em>NCCert<em>)</em></a>. It is a public centre provided by the Polish National Bank which issues certificates to qualified trust service providers for the verification of advanced electronic signatures or electronic seals as referred to in Regulation 910/2014, and certificates for the verification of other trust services provided by qualified trust service providers. Apart from qualified electronic signatures, two kinds of electronic signatures shall have the equivalent legal effect of a handwritten signature for public entities: the ‘personal signature’ based on a certificate contained in an electronic chip f the Polish national eID card, and the ‘trusted signature’. This is a specific signature which includes a person’s identification data taken from an electronic identification means which is issued under a public electronic identification scheme.  </p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474967"></a>Act on the National Cybersecurity System</p><p>The adoption of the Act on the National Cybersecurity System, on 5 July 2018, transposed the Directive (EU) 2016/1148 concerning measures for a high common level of security of network and information systems across the Union into the Polish legal system. This legislation defined the national cybersecurity system and the tasks and responsibilities of the entities in the system. The purpose of the national cybersecurity system was to ensure cybersecurity at national level, including the uninterrupted provision of essential services and digital services, by achieving an appropriate level of security involving the information systems used to provide these services, and by providing for incident handling. The act also specified:</p><ul><li>The scope of the Polish National Cybersecurity Strategy;</li><li>The establishment of a Single Point of Contact for cyber security run by the minister competent for digitalisation;</li><li>The institution of the Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity responsible for the coordination of activities and implementation of the government policy in the field of cybersecurity;</li><li>The creation of an Advisory Committee operating in the Council of Ministers, in the capacity of consultative and advisory body in matters of cybersecurity;</li><li>The establishment of three CSIRTs at national level and seven competent authorities responsible for cybersecurity within essential sectors in Poland (listed in the annex to the act);</li><li>The addition of the public administration to the system with regard to incident handling and reporting;</li></ul><p>Poland has almost completed the identification and designation of operators of essential services. Moreover, the effective cooperation and coordination mechanisms are in place. Additionally, one legal act (secondary legislation) – an ordinance of the Minister of Digital Affairs on organisational and technical conditions for entities providing cybersecurity services and internal organisational structures of operators of essential services responsible for cybersecurity – was amended due to market needs.</p><p>The government decided to maintain and develop its decentralised approach towards a governance structure of its cybersecurity system. There is a clear division of responsibilities and capabilities between all the involved institutions established pursuant to the act. The act allowed the creation of an efficient, comprehensive system enabling stakeholders to detect, prevent, and mitigate the impact of incidents that affected Polish national interests, while helping crucial societal and economic activities.  </p><p>The act created a coherent incident response system based on the leading role of three Computer Security Incident Response Teams at national level (CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK and CSIRT GOV) with a certain and clear division of constituencies. </p><p>The Government Plenipotentiary for Cybersecurity, responsible for the coordination of the activities and the implementation of the government policy in the field of cybersecurity, was set up together with an Advisory Committee for Cybersecurity operating at the Council of Ministers, in the capacity of a consultative and advisory body in matters of cybersecurity and relevant activities of CSIRT MON, CSIRT NASK, CSIRT GOV, the sectoral cybersecurity teams and the competent authorities for cybersecurity. The Plenipotentiary and the Advisory Committee ensure the coordination of the cybersecurity system at governmental level. </p><p>In 2020, a process of amendment of the act was launched. On the basis of a detailed evaluation of the functioning of the Polish cybersecurity system, new measures will be introduced, inter alia: the information sharing mechanism will be updated by establishing Information Sharing and Analysis Centres (ISACs) within the system; the sectoral CSIRTs will be mandatory within the NIS Directive sectors. Moreover, the new law will implement measures provided for by the 5G Toolbox and ensure full alignment with the provisions of the Cybersecurity Act. </p><p class="subtitle">Act on the Protection of Personal Data</p><p>The initial Act on the Protection of Personal Data was adopted on 29 August 1997 and later amended.

In April 2006, the Public Procurement Law was largely amended in order to implement the provisions of the EU Directives on public procurement (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0017:EN:HTML">2004/17/EC</a> and <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0018:EN:HTML">2004/18/EC</a>), including those relating to electronic auctions and the Dynamic Purchasing System. This amended version placed electronic communications between the awarding entity and the economic operator on the same level as written or fax communications, regardless of the procurement procedure in question. Furthermore, it defined cases where transferred data must be supplied with a qualified electronic signature. In 2017, the Public Procurement Law was amended again to include the changes introduced by the <a href="http://prawo.sejm.gov.pl/isap.nsf/DocDetails.xsp?id=WDU20160001579">Act on Trust Services and Electronic Identification</a> of 5 September 2016.</p><p>On 1 January 2021, the new <a href="https://dziennikustaw.gov.pl/DU/2019/2019">Public Procurement Law</a> came into force. Following the EU Directives on public procurement (2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU), this law provides that all public procurement procedures must be electronic. This obligation applies to all proceedings, regardless of their value. The rules of the new Public Procurement Law take into account the currently applicable solutions for electronic communications. The new solution allows to submit a bid bond in electronic form.</p><p class="subtitle">Act on Electronic Invoicing in Public Procurement Concessions for Construction Works or Services and Public-Private Partnerships</p><p>Public institutions must be prepared to receive invoices in the form of electronic documents with prescribed structures.

Foreign nationals cannot use their national eID in Polish eServices.</p><p class="subtitle">Single Point of Contact</p><p>The Single Point of Contact is a communication interface (node) between Schengen Member States or Associated States. It allows for effective online communication, leading to regular implementation of tasks related to the exchange of cryptographic keys. In general, it will be used to exchange certificates between all countries of the Schengen area, which will enable the services (most often the Border Guard) to verify travel documents (usually passports). Suspicious persons (or suspects) will be subject to further verification of fingerprints with imprints placed in the document.</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">System of State Registers </p><p>The System of State Registers (SSR) combines six registers: PESEL (Personal Data Register), Registry of Civil Status, ID Cards Register, System of State Awards, Central Register of Objections and Contact Information Registry. The interconnections between each of them allow for the provision of new services. The System of State Registers is constantly developed and improved. Millions of operations take place annually involving data such as names, surnames, addresses, identity documents, citizenships, marital status, death and birth data. The registers in the SSR include referential data which are made available for other registers and exchange the information with each other. In 2021, it is planned to include another register in the SSR: the Passport Document Register. Work has also commenced on the creation of a Central Register of Voters to facilitate the handling of elections. </p><p class="subtitle">Registry of Sexual Crimes</p><p>The <a href="https://bip.ms.gov.pl/pl/rejestry-i-ewidencje/rejestr-sprawcow-przestepstw-na-tle-seksualnym/">Registry of Sexual Crimes</a> is a public database containing information about the most dangerous perpetrators of sexual crimes.
