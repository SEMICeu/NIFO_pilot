The portal provides citizens and enterprises with a single point of access to eGovernment services and also serves a third group of users, i.e. public sector agencies themselves, allowing them to interact with each other and exchange information. The contractor for the eGovernment Gateway is a governmental company called <a href="https://www.turksat.com.tr/en">Turksat</a>, Türkiye’s main provider of satellite communication and one of the biggest providers of IT infrastructure services.</p><p>The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) of the Presidency, in line with its mission, works in great cooperation with public institutions, local governments and the private sector in order to offer more services with high added value, and more qualified and integrated services via the Digital Türkiye Platform (eGovernment Gateway). In particular, the DTO continues to work not only to transfer services to the electronic environment, but also to change the service concept offered in a more human-centric way. In this context, the 12<sup>th</sup> meeting regarding ‘Digital Türkiye and Mitigation of Bureaucracy,’ under the chairmanship of the Vice President and the coordination of the DTO, was held in March 2021. All ministries, professional organisations that qualify as public institutions and the business world are invited to these meetings and the decisions made at the end of the meetings are followed by the DTO. </p><p>After the establishment of DTO, inter‑institutional coordination was maintained at the highest level and a high momentum was achieved for eGovernment efforts. For example, by 31 July 2018 the number of institutions integrated into the eGovernment Gateway was 460, the number of services provided was 3 370 and the number of eGovernment users was 38 711 601; but as of July 2022, the number of integrated institutions was 885, the number of services provided was 6 665 and the number of users was 59 628 323.</p><p>In addition, at the end of 2019 and 2020, the number of accesses to the eGovernment Gateway was respectively 1 179 624 439 and 2 305 790 643, at the end of 2021 it totalled 3 088 953 173. The main reason for this considerable increase was the rise in the burden on the eGovernment Gateway during the pandemic period, as many important services were transferred to the digital environment in order to provide public services 24/7 without interruption. </p><p>Especially during the COVID-19 outbreak, coordination was ensured by DTO in order to transfer of the most needed public services to the eGovernment Gateway such as:</p><ul><li>Pandemic social support pre-application;</li><li>Restructuring of social security debts;</li><li>Life Fits Home (HES) Code generation and request;</li><li>COVID-19 vaccination status inquiry and appointment;</li><li>Travel permit application; and</li><li>Loss of income, rental and turnover support applications for enterprises.</li></ul><p>Efforts to improve the benefits from the eGovernment Gateway for disadvantaged citizens were continued during the pandemic period and eGovernment Gateway access passwords started to be delivered to citizens over the age of 65 to their residential address. In this way, it was ensured that the individuals in question were able to benefit from many digital services, as well as get their appointments for the COVID‑19 vaccination through the eGovernment Gateway, like many other citizens. In addition, the access page can be transformed into a format allowing disabled citizens to make transactions.</p><p>To ensure accessibility and user-friendliness, the eGovernment Gateway is also accessible through the barrier-free eGovernment Gateway call centre. The call centre, specifically designed for disabled people, started to operate for eGovernment-related requests in 2018.
