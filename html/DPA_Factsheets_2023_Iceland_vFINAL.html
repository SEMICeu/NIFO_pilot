The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-744.x-emf" alt="32-744.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Iceland in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-747.x-emf" alt="32-747.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Iceland’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles. Areas in need of improvement are concentrated in the Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 5 (Technological Neutrality and Data Portability), 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility), 9 (Multilingualism), and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Indeed, the alignment and tailoring of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies comply partially with the EIF (Principle 1 – Recommendation 1) and the country should impose less technological solutions on citizens, businesses and other administrations that are technology-specific or disproportionate to their real needs (Principle 5 – Recommendation 8). Other areas of improvement in order to reach a higher score concern the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure that all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14), and the implementation of evaluation mechanisms to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of interoperable solutions (Principle 12 – Recommendation 19). </p><p><img src="img/32-749.x-emf" alt="32-749.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022 </a></p><p>The Icelandic results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall very good performance. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the area of interoperability governance. More specifically, the score of 2 for Iceland in Recommendations 22 and 23, both referring to the need to have process and catalogues for standards and work standardisation as well as to take into account relevant EU recommendations and seek to make the approach consistent across borders, lowers the overall governance interoperability result for Iceland.</p><p><img src="img/32-751.x-emf" alt="32-751.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Iceland’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a lower-medium performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with all components except the Conceptual model itself. More specifically, the country should increase its efforts with regard to Internal information sources and services and open data by, for example, developing a shared infrastructure of reusable services and information sources that can be used by all public administrations (Internal Information Sources and Services – Recommendation 36) and establishing procedures and processes to integrate the opening of data in common business processes, working routines, and in the development of new information systems (Open Data – Recommendation 41). Another area of improvement is Security and Privacy; in order to reach a higher score, Iceland should enhance the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (Security and Privacy – Recommendation 47).</p><p><img src="img/32-755.x-emf" alt="32-755.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Iceland concerning Cross-border interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at upper-middle performance of the country in 6 indicators. Particularly, Iceland has a high performance with the maximum score of four in Principles 2 (Openness), 6 (User-centricity), 8 (Security and Privacy), 11 (Preservation of information) as well as Legal interoperability and Technical interoperability. However, Iceland still has margin for improvement in relation to Integrated public services governance, Internal information sources and services, and Open Data. For instance, efforts could focus on establishing procedures and processes to integrate the opening of data in the common business processes, working routines, and in the development of new information systems (Recommendation 41). </p><p>Additional information on Bulgaria’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through interactive dashboards.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="img/32-758.png" alt="32-758.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc140674182"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Cloud Computing Strategy 2021</p><p>On 27 June 2022 the government published the <a href="https://island.is/en/news/policy-cloud_solutions">Cloud Computing Strategy</a>. The Cloud Strategy is the first comprehensive document on the use of cloud solutions by public bodies and sets out the government's goal of making Iceland among the world’s leading nations in the provision of digital services. The purpose of the public cloud policy is to achieve harmonised goals in the use of cloud solutions and their implementation within the public sector. Cloud solutions are already in use by many public bodies, making it urgent to co-ordinate these projects for efficiency and increased security purposes.  The emphasis on digital services and user-centric service design has increased the demand on institutions for a fast and efficient service. Cloud solutions that shorten the delivery time of infrastructure and IT services contribute to the quick, effective and secure provision of digital services. Cloud services also open up new opportunities, e.g., in the field of artificial intelligence, and for deeper data analysis, which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to exploit. A Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) was introduced by the Central Public Procurement Agency in the first quarter of 2022 to support purchasing of cloud services.</p><p class="subtitle">Government Data Security Classification</p><p><a href="https://www.stjornarradid.is/verkefni/upplysingataeknimal-rikisins/stefnur-/">Data Security Classification</a> is a prerequisite for more secure storage, handling and mediation of public sector data. It is also an important step in harmonising and amplifying more effective use and exchange of data between public bodies, the private sector and citizens. The classification was published in 2022. The classification scheme directly and indirectly impacts the use of cloud services in the public sector.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Strategy </p><p>The <a href="https://island.is/en/o/digital-iceland/digital-strategy">Digital Strategy</a> was published in July 2021.

The policy sets out a technical framework for all projects carried out under the leadership of both the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and the task force Digital Iceland, in cooperation with all agencies, municipalities, Ministries and enterprises. The policy is an important part of the government's plan on improved digital communication to the public. It also supports the objectives defined in the Nordic/Baltic Partnership, as stated in the Digital North 2.0 Declaration. </p><p>To ensure progress in the wide range of public digital projects planned, Digital Iceland published a tender in December 2019 and again in 2021. In the tenders, Digital Iceland sought to conclude agreements with software development teams to work on digital public solutions for the national portal <a href="https://island.is/">Island.is</a>.  A revamped portal for public services, Island.is, was launched in 2020, to provide a central point of access to all digital public services.</p><p>The number of visits to the site has increased steadily since then, and by December 2022 the number of visits corresponded to 82% of the population visiting it every month. The availability of public services through the portal has also increased significantly since it was launched.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital North 2.0</p><p>The ministerial declaration <a href="https://www.norden.org/en/declaration/ministerial-declaration-digital-north-20">Digital North 2.0</a> for the period 2021–2024 was finalised in the fall of 2021 and signed by the Ministers for Digital Development of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Greenland, Åland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

The <a href="https://www.government.is/news/article/2018/01/18/Fjarskipti-Island-ljostengt/">Iceland Rural Fibre Project</a> is a government initiative to roll out optical cable connections to nearly all permanent residences in rural areas from 2016 to 2022. The State contributes to the funding of the project, and local governments can apply for subsidies to supplement their own contributions. The project operates under the auspices of the Telecommunications Fund. Fibre rollout in rural areas also plays a role in upgrading core communications systems nationwide, which is a prerequisite for greater reliability, coverage and data-transmission speed across all mobile networks in the entire country. The project concluded in 2022, having contributed to the main broadband policy goal, namely that 99% of households and businesses nationwide have fibre access or are within 50 meters from fibre access by the end of 2025. As of 2022, according to the <a href="https://fjarskiptastofa.is/english">Electronic Communications Office of Iceland</a> (ECOI), that number stands at 95%.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">Unique Office IT Supplier for the Entire Public Sector</p><p>On 1 June 2019, Iceland became the first country to sign a contract which will make Microsoft the sole IT supplier for its entire public sector. The contract was renewed on 1 June 2021 and is valid for 5 years. The country teamed up with a single IT partner for the provision of a common cloud platform: Microsoft 365.</p><p>The introduction of Microsoft 365 aims to consolidate all services into a single license, while guaranteeing increased communication and collaboration between institutions. </p><p>Peter Quarfordts Skov, Public Sector Director at Microsoft Denmark &amp; Iceland, commented that the contract marked a shift in the way public sector and public services are perceived. He added that, as more countries digitalise their public services, there is an increasing need to enhance services, products and processes, not to mention the level of security. Although the decision should lead to increased interoperability among different public bodies, it increases the risk of vendor lock-in.<a id="_Hlk67487692"></a></p><p class="subtitle">Core Services of Island.is</p><p>Digital Iceland is developing so-called core solutions to facilitate the development of digital services on Island.is. The aim of the solutions is to support and co-ordinate the development of digital public service processes for the adoption of public entities.

Together, the business registries, the tax authorities and several statistical authorities in the Nordic countries have established the program and have set a roadmap to provide real-time business data for business-to-business and business-to-government. The Nordic countries are highly digitalised. Despite this, there is limited automation and reuse of data across the systems. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a><a id="_Hlk67487862"></a>Base Registries</h2><p class="subtitle">National Base Registries</p><p>Data accessibility to and reusability of data of base registries varies. Some registries - such as the Land Registry, Address Registry and the Map of Estimated Farmland Registry - make their data available free of charge on the <a href="http://www.opingogn.is">open data portal</a>. Other registries provide access to certain data on specific websites free of charge. On the <a href="http://www.skra.is">Registers Iceland website</a>, users can view data on individual properties by looking up the address or the property number. On the Directorate of Internal Revenue webpage, users can access information on businesses. </p><p>The administration of the base registries is coordinated by a number of public bodies in Iceland, with each base registry handling its respective master data type(s). </p><p>In particular:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://skra.is/english/">National Population and Properties Registry</a> is managed by the Ministry of Infrastructure and contains master data related to personal data (natural and legal persons) and property data;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.samgongustofa.is/umferd/okutaeki/okutaekjaskra/uppfletting/">Vehicle Registry</a> is managed by the Ministry of Infrastructure and contains master data related to vehicles;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.skatturinn.is/fyrirtaekjaskra/">Business Registry</a> is managed by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and contains master data related to business and legal persons and can be accessed free of charge on the <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/www.rsk.is/fyrirtaekjaskra__;!!NEMsmePo_HYI!d3lHGEL78ib5r7fZDcJwupZUSRJw-WzstEN6vudH3acVjfBYscKneQGm9mL3JyqSUDUkiyFIzaTJc1BSv9PgeD74SZAFICFD$">Directorate of Internal Revenue</a> webpage;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.skra.is/english/properties/property-registration/">Property Registry</a> is managed by the Ministry of Infrastructure and contains master data related to land and properties.</li></ul><p>There are also a number of data sharing agreements:</p><ul><li>The National Population Registry is distributed by means of agents throughout the society and widely used both by public and private entities. Public authorities have access to more information than private entities, in order to fulfil their duties. The entities pay for their use according to an agreement with Registers Iceland; and</li><li>The Properties Registry is both accessible online and shared through various entities. The entities pay for the use according to an agreement with Registers Iceland.</li></ul><p>Incorporation of the EU Open Data Directive (EU 2018/1807) into the EEA Agreement is under revision by the EFTA states. Should it be incorporated into the agreement, an updated legislation of all countries should support both a common catalogue of the base registries and high value datasets. </p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No infrastructure has been reported in this field to date.</p><h3>Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p>No infrastructure has been reported in this field to date.</p><h3>Big Data</h3><p>No infrastructure has been reported in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud Computing</h3><p>The government is currently working on technical policies for key cloud service providers (hyperscalers) and procurement policies.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No infrastructure has been reported in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing</h3><p>No infrastructure has been reported in this field to date.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p>No infrastructure has been reported in this field to date.</p><h3>GovTech</h3><p>No infrastructure has been reported in this field to date.</p><p><img src="img/32-776.png" alt="32-776.png" /></p><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p><p>	</p><h1><a id="_Toc140674185"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on Iceland’s responsible bodies for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-iceland">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474973"></a>National </h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474975"></a>Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs </p><p>The <a href="https://www.government.is/ministries/ministry-of-finance-and-economic-affairs/">Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs</a> is responsible for strategy and policymaking for digital transformation and ICT.
