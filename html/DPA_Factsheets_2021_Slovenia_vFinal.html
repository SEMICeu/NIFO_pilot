Moreover, a sound eHealth infrastructure facilitated long awaited digitisation of communicable disease registries and epidemiology services. Essential digital tools have been provided for public health authorities and policy makers.</p><p>In November 2020, a new central service was introduced to cover the e-delivery of the official documents to the citizens and between public institutions. More than 100 public institutions can electronically deliver documents according to the <a href="https://www.uradni-list.si/glasilo-uradni-list-rs/vsebina/2020-01-2919?sop=2020-01-2919">Administrative procedure legislation</a>.

The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Slovenia 2020 - Development Strategy for the Information Society</p><p>At the beginning of 2016, the government of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the long-term <a href="https://www.gov.si/assets/ministrstva/MJU/DID/Digital-Slovenia-2020-Development-Strategy-for-the-Information-Society-until-2020.pdf">Digital Slovenia 2020 - Development Strategy for the Information Society</a>. The detailed objectives of this strategy included:</p><ul><li>Raising general awareness on the importance of information and communication technologies (ICT) and the internet for the development of society;</li><li>Sustainable, systematic and targeted investment in the development of a digital society;</li><li>General digitalisation according to the ‘Digital by Default’ principle;</li><li>Competitive digital entrepreneurship and digital industry for digital growth;</li><li>Intensive and innovative use of ICT and the internet in all segments of society;</li><li>High-speed access, open internet for all;</li><li>Inclusive digital society;</li><li>Secure cyberspace;</li><li>Trust and confidence in the cyberspace and the protection of human rights; and</li><li>Slovenia – a point of reference for the deployment of innovative approaches in the use of digital technologies.</li></ul><p>The strategy’s vision calls on Slovenia to take advantage of the development opportunities of ICT and the internet, thus becoming an advanced digital society and reference environment for the deployment of innovative approaches in the use of digital technologies at a systemic level. At the same time, a high level of protection of personal data and communication privacy in a digital society should be ensured. This will create trust and confidence in digitalisation and the cyberspace.</p><p>The government favours investments in the digitalisation of entrepreneurship, an innovative data-driven economy, the development and use of the internet, as well as smart communities, cities and homes. Within these limits, it favours research on and technology development of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, Big Data and mobile technologies. Because the government wishes to enable equal integration into the European Digital Single Market for Slovenian stakeholders, it uses ICT and the internet innovatively in all development areas. In the future, it will invest in education to promote digital society.</p><p>Currently this is still the only valid strategy for this field. However, we have to stress that the new strategy for the information society is under preparation. The new strategy will cover the following domains:</p><ul><li>Digital connectivity;</li><li>Cybersecurity;</li><li>Digital public services;</li><li>Digital inclusion;</li><li>Society 5.0 (advanced technologies e.g. AI, IoT or open data).</li></ul><p>Any further details are currently unavailable as they are still under negotiation, but the new strategy, called Digital Slovenia 2030, shall be adopted by the end of 2021.</p><p class="subtitle">Public Administration 2020 – Slovenian Public Administration Development Strategy 2015-2020</p><p>The main purpose of the <a href="http://www.mju.gov.si/nc/en/media_room/news/article/1328/6505/">Slovenian Public Administration Development Strategy</a> is to create a platform for a real improvement in the operations of Slovenia’s public administration, which is about to undergo modernisation and renewal. Reform will be achieved by introducing a comprehensive management system through centralised strategic planning, while ensuring quality control systems for the simplification and modernisation of administrative processes, as well as monitoring and evaluating the work done and the targets to be achieved across all levels. Effective public administration cannot be achieved without efficient government IT. Improving the state of ICT in public administration will have significant synergistic effects in achieving other strategic targets, as well as in the development of the information society as a whole. </p><p>Data governance is a prerequisite for data driven developments, operations, decisions, and innovative approaches. In this context, a set of actions was put in place. The development of a central metadata dictionary is a priority and is also the prerequisite for a data repository. A data repository will provide views with different perspectives and contexts, which will be the root for the knowledge and understanding of the data. The repository will provide information on how applications are connected to the data, what institutions are responsible for the data, and how data is used through public administration procedures.</p><p><a id="_Hlk8376358"></a></p><p>In the context of the Slovenian Public Administration Development Strategy 2015-2020, which also covered the Digital Government Strategy, the government adopted an action plan every two years. Currently, this is still the only valid strategy for this field. However, we have to stress that a Digital Public Services Strategy is under preparation. It will also be part of the 2030 Digital Slovenia Strategy. The new strategy will cover:</p><ul><li>User-friendly and easy digital services;</li><li>Data for better services and decision-making;</li><li>A secure, trustworthy and inclusive digital environment.</li></ul><p>Any further details are not available at the moment as they are still under negotiation, but the new strategy shall be adopted by the end of 2021.</p><p class="subtitle">Semantic Interoperability Implementation Strategy</p><p>In 2018, the <a href="http://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/strategija+upravljanja+semanticne+interoperabilnosti?lang=en">Semantic Interoperability Implementation Strategy</a> was adopted.

However, experience with the pandemic has shown the need for further digitalisation in all areas, including public administration, as digital public administration is a prerequisite for an agile response to change and efficient provision of services to both citizens and businesses.</p><p>Slovenia chose to focus the allocation of its resources on:</p><ul><li>The centralisation of government IT (e.g. government private cloud); </li><li>The development of digital solutions with different horizontal building blocks for common functionalities, e.g. for data exchange (Tray), trust services for authentication, eSignature and other trust services, like a central e-delivery and eMandate system; </li><li>A digital services development platform (so called JEP) – establishing a national framework for the successful implementation of eServices; </li><li>The introduction of a national eID card by the end of 2021 and a mobile‑based solution for eIdentification and eSignature, aiming to improve the take-up of eServices.</li></ul><p>For the future development, the Slovenian government confirms its political commitment towards ensuring high quality, user-centric and seamless cross-border digital public services for citizens and businesses, ensuring that they are inclusive of and accessible also for persons with disabilities. The cooperation will continue between government, citizens, businesses, academia and civil society, gradually increasing the level of co-design with the end users. The government will encourage the use of AI and other novel technologies to improve the well‑being of the citizens, always paying attention to the fundamental rights. As other members of the European Union, Slovenia is now preparing a Resilience and Recovery Plan, focusing on the component of the digital transformation of the public sector and public administration, which will provide an appropriate response to the critical shortcomings in the public sector digitisation that were revealed (even more clearly) during the COVID-19 epidemic, such as: insufficient range, availability or quality of eServices, insufficient and outdated IT equipment, insufficient network connection capacity and IT infrastructure, which turned out to be particularly problematic in the light of the increased volume of digital business.</p><p>The component envisages six reforms: </p><ul><li>Strengthening the public administration digital transformation management; </li><li>Establishing an environment for the use of public administration eServices; </li><li>Establishing a competence centre and raising the skills of public administration employees; </li><li>Modernising administrative processes for a successful digital transformation;</li><li>Ensuring cybersecurity; </li><li>Transitioning to a gigabit society and investing in nine areas that go beyond public administration and interfere with the field of public sector operation (strengthening the digital skills of civil servants, the gigabit infrastructure, digitalisation in the public administration environment, internal security, education, science and sport, environment and space, agriculture, food and forestry, culture and justice).</li></ul><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">National Interoperability Framework </p><p>The <a href="http://nio.gov.si/nio/vstopna.nio?lang=en">National Interoperability Framework (NIO) Portal</a> is a cornerstone of interoperability and a basic tool for publishing, monitoring, and using interoperability products.

Among other provisions, the act sets out rules on mandatory publication of procurement notices in the <a href="https://www.enarocanje.si/">Public Procurement Portal</a>, on mandatory electronic submission and electronic communication in procurement procedures, on electronic verification of tenderers via official documents the information system eDossier, on the dynamic purchasing system and electronic auctions, thus also laying the groundwork for a public, State-developed eProcurement system called e-JN <a href="https://ejn.gov.si/en/">Information System. <a id="_Hlk67991725"></a>After the technological renovation at the end of 2018, the system combines functionalities that were originally developed as part of different stand-alone modules/applications </a>(eSubmissions, eAuctions, eDossier, eCatalogue and eInternal procedures for public authorities). </p><p>Furthermore, the 2017 amendment to the <a href="http://www.djn.mju.gov.si/resources/files/Sistem_javnega_narocanja/ZPVPJN/ZPVPJN_ang_julij_18.pdf">Legal Protection in Public Procurement Procedures Act</a> introduced an electronic information system for legal protection procedures in public procurement, i.e. the <a href="https://www.portalerevizija.si/">eRevision Portal</a>. The eRevision Portal was established in September 2019 and enables the exchange of information and documents between contracting authorities, selected tenderers, the National Review Commission and other participants in the appeal proceedings. The eRevision Portal enables a widespread flow of information about the course of the review procedure. It communicates with the Public Procurement Portal to allow a smooth flow of information and documentation. This will significantly reduce the duration of the procedure and the administrative burdens and costs for the parties involved. The use of this portal is mandatory from 1 January 2021. </p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing Legislation</p><p>In Slovenia, the competent authority with purview on eInvoicing is the <a href="https://www.ujp.gov.si/dokumenti/dokument.asp?id=295">Public Payments Administration of the Republic of Slovenia</a>, attached to the Ministry of Finance.</p><p>Since 1 January 2015, public sector institutions have begun receiving electronic invoices for any goods and services. This function was based on the <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7120"><a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7120">Provision of Payment Services to Budget Users Act</a></a> (<a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO7120">ZOPSPU-1</a>). </p><p>The Public Payments Administration serves as a single entry and exit point for the exchange of eInvoices between administrations, and between public administration and external entities as well.</p><h2>Domain-specific legislation</h2><p class="subtitle">Amendment to the Healthcare Databases Act</p><p>By amending the <a href="http://pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO1419">Healthcare Databases Act</a> in 2015, legal ground was provided for the eHealth system, enabling interoperability and the exchange of health data on a national level. Ever since, considerable progress has been made in terms of development, availability and use of eHealth. The Healthcare Databases Act was amended in 2018 to support cancer screening programmes and clinical registries. In 2020, the act was further amended in order to respond to the challenges of the COVID-19 epidemics and the related data processing requirements. The amendment provided legal ground for comprehensive digitalisation of communicable disease surveillance. Moreover, it facilitated the processing of health records for all persons receiving medical treatment in Slovenia, irrespective of their nationality, by means of enabling cross-border exchange of healthcare records within the Central Registry of Patient Data (CRPD). </p><p class="subtitle">Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act </p><p>The <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4284">Protection of Documents, Archives and Archival Institutions Act</a> and the accompanying Regulation on Documents and Archives Protection were both passed in 2006 to regulate the management of electronic content. The act states that all electronic records, including digitalised documents, have full legal status provided they comply with certain technical conditions. The accompanying regulation governs the activities and internal rules for individuals to keep documents and/or archives, the storage of such materials in physical and digital forms, the general conditions, the registration and accreditation of digital storage equipment and services, the selection and transfer of archives to public archival institutions, the processing and keeping of registers of archives, the protection of film and private archives, the use of archives in archival institutions and the work of the Archives Commission. The law also contains provisions regarding the long-term validity of eSignatures. Later amendments to the act took place in 2014. </p><p>This law eliminated the obligation of certifying internal rules for companies and public authorities at the Archives Commission and simplified the procedures for accreditation. It granted companies and other private organisations the power to decide, autonomously and without any State interference, the best method to store digital documents, leaving them the choice of the solutions and technologies to adopt.</p><p class="subtitle">Amendments to the Tax Procedure Act</p><p>With the 2016 amendments to the <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO4703">Tax Procedure Act</a> (Official Gazette of the Republic of Slovenia, No. 13/11 - official consolidated text, 32/12, 94/12 , 101/13 - ZDavNepr, 111/13, 22/14 - US decision, 25/14 - ZFU, 40/14 - ZIN-B, 90/14, 91/15, 63/16, 69/17, 13/18 - ZJF-H, 36/19, 66/19, 145/20 - ex.

The test is mandatory since January 2017. The public can thus access the tool through the eDemocracy Portal that enables citizens to actively cooperate and take part in the decision-making process. The most important part is the opportunity to influence the drafting of regulations by expressing opinions and sending proposals and comments on regulation drafts to those who are preparing them and to the final decision makers. </p><p>In July 2019, the <a href="https://www.stopbirokraciji.gov.si/fileadmin/user_upload/mju/templates/pdf/AN_VG_17-6-2019-b3_P.pdf">Action Plan for Better Regulation</a> was adopted by the government of the Republic of Slovenia with the aim of systematically regulating better regulation.

The objective of the ICT Innovation Network, according to the S3 strategy, is to provide support to the development activities of all strategic partnerships in Slovenia in the ICT field, above all in laying the groundwork for the use and integration of ICT as enabling technologies and their development in different priority domains (circular economy, mobility, agri-food, smart cities &amp; communities). The ICT Innovation Network works closely with the Ministry of Public Administration to develop and promote data models and data interoperability in ICT solutions for smart societies. </p><p>The Slovenian Smart Specialisation Strategy is currently under revision and should be finished by the end of 2021.

The purpose of the national call was to enable the national designation process of entities to be proposed to the EC. The goal was to strengthen the local and national potential in the field of digital transformation in the private and public sector. The national process was concluded and entities have been announced to the European Commission, which will execute its own procedure, close the call and decide through a process involving experts, which entity should be co‑funded (more info on the national call are available <a href="https://www.gov.si/zbirke/javne-objave/javni-poziv-slovenskim-digitalnim-inovacijskim-sticiscem-dih-ki-zelijo-postati-evropska-digitalna-inovacijska-sticisca-edihnov-javna-objava/">here</a>).</p><p>Existing DIHs are already building multi-sector and multi-discipline partnerships with universities, research and business institutes, companies, ICT providers and businesses to support organisations in the ecosystem in sustainably achieving their short-term and long-term vision. The DIHs are entities that provide support for digital transformation across different sectors, ICT as well as traditional sectors. To be able to provide all the necessary knowledge and equipment, the DIHs need to collaborate with research &amp; technology organisations (RTO) and various different stakeholders. They normally combine the national, regional and local level and, to be able to do so effectively, they need to have a wide range of partners. The DIHs are currently filling the existing gaps on the market, and some of the existing DIH will become EDIH and thus offer an even wider variety of services, according to EC rules. For the time being, the DIHs benefit from a great support from the European Commission, which aims to gather all European DIHs under one umbrella, the EDIH network. However, each Member State is free to organise national DIHs in the way it deems best. Some of the current DIH actively collaborate with schools, local communities, municipalities, and inter-sector centres to foster digitalisation, depending on their main focus or specialisation.</p><p class="subtitle">INSPIRE Project Group</p><p>The <a href="http://www.geoportal.gov.si/eng/directive-implementation/coordination/inspire-group">INSPIRE Project Group</a> is an inter-sectoral strategic bodies coordination group involving stakeholders, data &amp; metadata managers, and ad hoc working groups regarding metadata, standards, interoperability of spatial data sets and services.

The role that the Information Commissioner has played is vital in ensuring a high degree of institutional transparency. The number of individual complaints is steadily growing every year, which shows that the awareness of the Right to Access to Public Information has risen also among Slovenian citizens. The Information Commissioner receives only a low number of complaints every year regarding the right to reuse public information when compared to the number of complaints raised over the refusal of the access to public documents. This can be interpreted as evidence that government efforts to promote and enable the reuse of public sector information are working.<a id="_Toc1474981"></a></p><h2><a id="_Hlk69200004"></a>Subnational (federal, regional and local)</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474982"></a>Policy</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474983"></a>Local Self-government Service </p><p>The Local Self-government Service within the <a href="http://www.mju.gov.si/en/">Ministry of Public Administration</a> is responsible for drafting regulations regarding the organisation, functioning and financing of municipalities.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.pisrs.si/Pis.web/pregledPredpisa?id=ZAKO3225">State Administration Act</a> (Official Gazette of the RS No. 113/05; 89/07, 126/07, 48/09, 8/10, 8/12, 21/12, 47/13, 12/14, 90/14 and 51/16) in Article 74a sets out the rules for administration information and communication system management.

Recently, many municipalities enhanced their policies on digitalisation and/or smart cities. Some municipalities adopted formal strategies that guide the municipal administration in the development of this field. Some examples include, but are not limited to, the cities of <a href="https://www.koper.si/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Koper_pametno_mesto_strategija.pdf">Koper</a> (2015), <a href="https://www.kranj.si/files/06_mestna_obcina/strateski-dokumenti/strategija-pametno-mesto-gradivo-za-mestni-svet-14102020.pdf">Kranj</a> (2020), <a href="https://ks.novomesto.si/mma/10_strategija_digitalnega_razvoja_110_2020/2020100109583746/?m">Novo mesto</a> (2020), <a href="https://www.smartcitymaribor.si/si/Strategija/">Maribor</a> and Ptuj (foreseen for 2021).</p><p>It is important to note that more than 20 Slovenian cities succeeded in the <a href="https://www.intelligentcitieschallenge.eu/cities/ljubljana">100 Intelligent Cities Challenge</a> (ICC), which will result in the formation of new digitalisation strategies and policies.</p><h3>Coordination</h3><p class="subtitle">Municipalities</p><p>In accordance with the constitutional provisions, Slovenian municipalities and urban municipalities are autonomous in the field of introducing eSolutions. Local eGovernment initiatives are solely under the responsibility of local authorities, mostly municipalities, which implement them using their own mechanisms and time schedules. </p><p>Voluntary coordination is taking place in the framework of local government associations. For instance, the <a href="https://www.zmos.si/english/">Association of Urban Municipalities of Slovenia</a> established the Committee for Digitalisation and Smart Cities, which unites experts of the 11 urban municipalities. Cities exchange information on best practices, solutions and challenges and prepare position papers on State policies and public tenders. As the resources for implementing digital solutions at local level are limited, cities explore possibilities for cooperation in projects and initiatives that could be co‑financed by EU or State funds. </p><p>The <a href="https://skupnostobcin.si/english/">Association of Municipalities and Towns of Slovenia (SOS)</a> is another example of coordination of local self-government bodies. Besides working with bodies dealing with digital transition, the SOS coordinates access rights and offers support to the local authorities on the eTourism system. The SOS established a strategic partnership with University of Ljubljana, which resulted in the creation of the <a href="https://4pdih.com/en/intro-page/">4PDIH</a>. The aim of the 4PDIH is to foster awareness and provide services to grow digital competencies, share digital experience and case studies locally, regionally and internationally, and support the government to adapt regulation and open its data to foster entrepreneurship.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474984"></a>Implementation</h3><p>The implementation performance varies across municipalities and is dependent on the mayors’ agendas, the size of the municipality (critical mass of users) and the resources available to each municipality. In this framework, human resources often prove to be as challenging as financial ones. Generally, urban municipalities, i.e. the 11 main regional centres, achieved significant improvement in the digitalisation of services by developing various portals and digital solutions, including the digitalisation of public services data.</p><p class="subtitle">Smart Mlaka - a Smart Pilot Project</p><p>A prominent digitalisation and smart city project is being implemented in the city of Kranj. The <a href="https://www.interreg-central.eu/Content.Node/CITYCIRCLE/Smart-Mlaka-pilot-project.html">Smart Mlaka</a> Project is a pilot action of smart and digital solutions being applied at a neighbourhood level. The final solution of the mentioned project will enable the collection, display and analysis of data from smart meters (electricity, gas, water), smart sensors for the environment and traffic. This will give the municipality an insight into the organisation, the management and the challenges of such projects, and will constitute a model suitable for implementation in the rest of the municipality and beyond.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474985"></a>Support</h3><p class="subtitle">Smart Cities and Communities </p><p>The Ministry of Public Administration published in February 2021 a public tender for pilot projects for the creation of smart cities and communities, providing EUR 8 million of funding from the Operational Programme for the Implementation of the EU Cohesion Policy in the period 2014–2020. The tender is not yet concluded, nevertheless it is a positive sign that 14 applications from 14 municipal consortia, which include 159 municipalities (i.e. 75% of all municipalities), were submitted by the first deadline. Municipalities will develop new digital and smart solutions, including, but not limited to, new platforms for citizens, city cards, sensors (IoT), etc. in the fields of environment, sustainable mobility, public infrastructure management and others.</p><p>Municipalities that participate in successful ICC consortia are being supported with expert assistance from the ICC programme.</p><h3>Interoperability coordination</h3><p class="subtitle">Interoperability </p><p>Municipalities are aware of the importance of interoperability solutions, since digital solutions at local level tend to be fragmented. </p><p>The public tender mentioned in paragraph 5.2.4 provides that the supported projects will have to assure the interoperability of solutions and the usage of the same data models and open standards. </p><h3>Base registry coordination</h3><p>No responsible organisations have been reported to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474986"></a>Audit</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474987"></a>Court of Audit </p><p>The <a href="http://www.rs-rs.si/en/">Court of Audit</a> is the body in charge of supervising State accounts and all public spending in Slovenia.

There are sub-portals available for Slovenia’s Italian and Hungarian national minorities and information is classified according to life events. Each insight into the specific life situations of citizens and businesses is associated with links leading to public administration web pages with a similar content.</p><p>In November 2015, the eGovernment State Portal was launched. It was completely redesigned using a new system architecture and a new user interface. It was based on a CMS system, which enables effortless content maintenance.</p><p>In 2021, more than 30 back-offices, registers and other databases have connected to the portal. Services are provided according to life events. </p><p>The main elements of the renewed portal are the electronic services, which are seamlessly integrated into the content and easily accessible. Users may access various services (currently about 250) through the integration of public bodies’ information systems. Every authenticated user can use their digital certificate to access personal storage, which allows them to store their private documents. The users can also view their personal data from various public records (e.g. personal information, information about their vehicle and real estate property).</p><p>eUprava is the first portal that enables its users to authenticate and eSign the applications with mobile phones. This functionality is based on the integration of SI‑PASS (the authentication and eSignature service) that, since April 2018, also offers an authentication and eSignature mobile service called smsPASS (see below for more info on SI-PASS and smsPASS). </p><p>Since November 2020, the portal has been integrated with the new central solution for eDelivery SI-CeV. The users can activate their secure mailbox within their My e-Government personal space to receive official documents according to the administrative procedure legislation from more than 100 public institutions. In 2021, the possibility has been introduced to authenticate on the portal using foreign certificates via eIDAS mechanisms.</p><p>In 2020–2021, new electronic services for municipalities were published on the portal, both on the Portal for Citizens eUprava and on the Business Portal <a href="https://spot.gov.si/">SPOT</a>.</p><p>During the COVID-19 crisis, some successful new electronic applications were offered, also without eAuthentication, to increase the number of possible users (e.g. financial aid for students, residence registrations).

The MFERAC was developed by the <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/ministries/ministry-of-finance/">Ministry of Finance</a> as support for the implementation of the national budget by means of a single accounting system.</p><p class="subtitle">SPOT Portal for Businesses</p><p>The <a href="https://spot.gov.si/">One-Stop Shop Business Portal SPOT</a> (formerly named eVEM) is the government portal for companies and sole traders, whose main purpose is to enable users to carry out public administration operations easily, quickly and free of charge. Through the SPOT Portal, businesses can use electronic services to establish a company and carry out other obligatory or frequent procedures, either at start-up or later (submission of forms for social insurance registration, declaration of changes to information on family members, notification of needs for workers, declaration of tax information, etc.). Users can carry out certain procedures independently online, using a valid digital certificate, while for some other more complicated procedures they would need to visit one of the 139 One Stop Shop contact points, the VEM point or a public notary. </p><p>The main advantages of the SPOT Portal are the following: it enables a free-of-charge sole trader registration within one day (in the past it took seven days), the registration of a company with limited liabilities within three days (in the past it took more than 60 days). It also enables several eServices. </p><p>The majority of services carried out via the SPOT Portal or the SPOT points are free of charge. New services are constantly developed for SPOT. In terms of development of new services, relevant stakeholders are being involved and the principles of interoperability are followed. The development is carried out with the cooperation of different governmental bodies. It includes the connection of different IT systems into the eService of SPOT, aiming at reusing already available data from different registries or systems and following the Once-Only principle, where possible.</p><p>In 2020, an important new functionality - the ‘electronic sick leave’ - was introduced on the portal, which significantly reduced the administrative burden. The estimated cost savings for all participating stakeholders are EUR 11.5 million yearly. </p><p>In 2020–2021, new electronic services for municipalities were published on the portal, both on the Portal for Citizens eUprava and on the Business Portal SPOT.</p><p>In addition, the portal was visually redesigned in January 2021 to harmonise the user experience and, at the same time, improve the stability of the portal.</p><p class="subtitle">GOV.SI Portal</p><p>In 2016, the Slovenian government approved a new editorial project to avoid duplication of content on national websites and the main government portal. The number of administrative websites was cut from 350 to around 30. The new <a href="http://www.gov.si/">GOV.SI Portal</a> was launched in 2019 as central website for easy access to comprehensive information on the organisation and functioning of the State administration. Currently, GOV.SI is hosting web pages of 122 government bodies. </p><p>With this central platform, it was possible to quickly establish an efficient and central <a href="https://www.gov.si/teme/koronavirus-sars-cov-2/">digital communication channel</a> for COVID-19-related information, instructions, data etc. </p><p class="subtitle">NIO - National Interoperability Framework Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://nio.gov.si/nio/vstopna.nio?lang=en">NIO Portal</a> enables the Slovenian Public Administration to publish information on the achievements of its digital solutions at the national level and beyond. The NIO Portal is part of the Slovenian National Interoperability Framework, consisting of different guidelines, standards, information and building blocks. It helps to improve the coordination of business processes and enables better compatibility and connectivity on the national and international levels. Many useful assets are published and explained on the NIO Portal. Institutions can use them when designing their business processes and related information systems. Examples of this include building blocks for electronic data enquiries, trade, the Bio Module, the Asynchronous Module and the Security Platform. If an institution wants to electronically gather data from data sources, it can use these building blocks and their functionalities. The owner of the information is always the institution which created them, regardless of whether the institution is part of the private sector or is a non‑governmental organisation. The use of NIO assets and solutions reduces development and operating costs, and achieves improved coherence of information solutions, as well as compliance with the European Interoperability Framework and coordination with solutions at the international level (e.g. the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/slovenian-interoperability-portal-nio">Joinup Platform</a>). </p><p class="subtitle">EUGO Slovenia </p><p>The <a href="http://eugo.gov.si/">EUGO Slovenia Portal</a> helps foreign business entities from the EU, the EEA and the Swiss Confederation seeking to do business in Slovenia. The site provides information about the conditions and procedures required for performing a certain activity or profession in the Republic of Slovenia. In providing this service, Slovenia is meeting the requirements of European directives, and enabling simpler and friendlier operations on the Slovenian market. </p><p class="subtitle">Stop the Bureaucracy Website</p><p>The<a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/ministries/ministry-of-public-administration/about-the-ministry/administrative-burden-reduction-and-better-regulation-service/"> Division for the Administrative Burden Reduction, Better Regulation and Quality in Public Administration</a> at the Ministry of Public Administration actively implements the principles of better regulation to ensure that decision making is open and transparent, that governmental actions are based on evidence. Its purpose is to understand the impacts of decisions, to achieve greater competitiveness of Slovenian businesses and to increase the satisfaction of citizens who engage with the public administration. </p><p>The <a href="https://www.stopbirokraciji.gov.si/en/home" target="_blank">Stop the Bureaucracy Portal</a> plays a key role since it represents a link between the administration that prepares regulations and controls their implementation and the public, who can find all information about the administrative measures for reducing administrative and legislative burdens in one place. The video explaining in detail the process of submitting proposals to the portal can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE4DkYB1BBU&amp;feature=emb_title">here</a>. </p><p>The portal also provides information on programme implementation, publishes best practices (at both national and EU levels) and reports on administrative burdens and individual regulations (act, rule, etc.).</p><p>Users (and stakeholders) can submit proposals for reducing the regulatory burden and simplifying procedures. After being published on the website, proposals are assigned to the competent ministries, which may then express their opinions on the proposals and give their feedback to the user issuing the proposal. </p><p>It is also tasked with overseeing the implementation of the adopted initiatives, which are then translated into actions with clearly defined objectives, deadlines and responsible institutions, and aggregated in the <a href="https://enotnazbirkaukrepov.gov.si/">Single Document aimed at improving the legislative and business environment</a>. The stakeholders can regularly monitor the state of measure implementation online. In order to monitor the elimination of regulatory burdens, ex-post evaluations of the impacts of measures included in the Single Document are carried out. All ex-post evaluations are available on the Stop the Bureaucracy Portal.</p><p class="subtitle">Geoportal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.geoportal.gov.si/eng/">Slovenian Geoportal</a> was launched in 2008 and serves as the central access point for spatial data and the harmonised European spatial data infrastructure, INSPIRE. Here users can find a list of INSPIRE and other national spatial data sets and services, INSPIRE metadata, legislation related to INSPIRE requirements for establishing and operating interoperable National SDI, guidelines for technical interoperability, and the spatial data viewer. A new Slovenian metadata profile was established in the form of an extended INSPIRE metadata profile. Metadata are connected (automatic harvesting) to the national Open Data Portal. The portal was renewed last year. It allows easier access to all data and improves searching. The portal allows access to spatial data via spatial data services and metadata. Slovenian metadata are also connected to the <a href="https://inspire-geoportal.ec.europa.eu/" target="_blank">European INSPIRE Geoportal</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">GeoHub-SI Portal</p><p><a href="https://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/geohubsi?lang=en">GeoHub-SI</a> is a GIS portal that provides a platform for publishing space-related content. The data published are in the form of GIS web services and applications, intended for both the internal and the general public. Users can view, query and analyse spatial data using published applications. Data presented in the form of web services can also be included in external applications. The portal is intended for access to data, services and applications shared by State institutions.</p><p>The infrastructural foundation of the portal is the National Computer Cloud (DRO), provided by the Ministry of Public Administration. The Ministry is also responsible for the uniform development of common information solutions in the State administration, so all those State institutions that have the right to use services on the DRO can publish on the portal.</p><p class="subtitle">National Open Data Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://podatki.gov.si/">National Open Data Portal (OPSI)</a> was launched in December 2016. The OPSI Portal represents a single national website for publishing open data for the entire public sector and has a dual function. Firstly, it represents the central catalogue of records and databases in the country; it is a central inventory of metadata from all records and databases managed by State authorities, municipalities and other public sector bodies. Secondly, it represents a single website for publishing data in open and machine‑readable formats. The portal provides everyone with the right to a free and easy reuse of freely accessible data published in the ‘open data’ form for any  purpose (i.e. for profit or not for profit). On the portal, all public sector bodies publish data by category. Currently, over 5 000 data sets have been published on the portal (at least with metadata). </p><p>The goal was to establish the so-called Open Data Ecosystem based on the OPSI Portal, to encourage cooperation between all stakeholders concerned by the opening and/or reuse of data. In March 2020, the Slovenian government achieved its goal by establishing the OPSIHub. A year later, the OPSIHub has 15 members which represent public sector institutions, educational institutions, non-governmental organisations, research journalists, start-up companies, small and medium-sized enterprises and larger companies.</p><p>Slovenia was ranked among the top countries in the field of open data (OECD OURIndex 2019). Slovenia also ensures a high level of protection to the right of access to public information with the aim of increasing the participation of citizens and raising the accountability of public authorities to ensure good governance and tackle corruption. In 2021, Slovenia will start renovating the OPSI Portal. It will be updated based on the latest guidelines and good practices followed by the best open data portals around the world.</p><p class="subtitle">e-JN</p><p><a href="https://ejn.gov.si/en/">After the technological renovation at the end of 2018, the system combines functionalities that were originally developed as part of different stand-alone modules/applications </a>(eSubmissions, eAuctions, eDossier, eCatalogue and eInternal procedures). The modules/applications are integrated into a comprehensive system on a single platform that enables conducting public procurement procedures in a fully electronic way. </p><p>The <a href="https://ejn.gov.si/">eProcurement System e-JN</a> was built with different levels of interoperability in mind. It was designed based on interoperable IT solutions (horizontal building blocks) for data distribution, authentication and identification. It also uses web services, provided by Slovenian agencies, especially the AJPES (Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Public Legal Records and Related Services) which is responsible for the Slovenian Business register, the Official Public Gazette for eTendering and other institutions that provide data on economic operators. It is also connected with office and financial system software that is widely used in public administration. The public State-developed eProcurement system called <a href="https://ejn.gov.si/">Information System e-JN</a> is free of charge.</p><p class="subtitle">Remote Sessions</p><p>In April 2020, the <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/national-assembly/">National Assembly</a> of the Republic of Slovenia amended its Rules of Procedure to introduce, given the situation related to COVID-19, the possibility of holding <a href="https://idp.dz-rs.si/nidp/app/login?id=rba-internal&amp;sid=0&amp;option=credential&amp;sid=0">remote sessions</a> of the National Assembly and of its working bodies, which enables deputies and other invitees from a remote location to participate equally in the session, which otherwise takes place in the National Assembly. The users connect to the system via a secure SSL connection, but a VPN connection can also be used. Before the session starts, they connect to a specific website and authenticate themselves using a two-factor login method with login name, a PIN and a password in the form of an SMS message. The solution enables business-friendly registration, participation in the debate, observance of the parliamentary hours and casting of votes with immediate final results that take into account the specific type of voting (simple majority, absolute majority, etc.). From their remote location, the users can see the room, monitor the parliamentary hour and see the results of the votes. In the event of a timeout, the system automatically interrupts the remote speech (as in the courtroom), and the speech of the remote participant can also be interrupted by the chairperson. The source of the image from the hall is a directed image, which is otherwise broadcast by the national television RTV SLO. Participants who are in the hall can see the speaker from a distance on the big screens, and hear the speech through the sound system. There is practically no delay in the connection.

It has become the main tool for organising, coordinating, administrating and analysing trainings, programmes and proficiency exams.<strong> </strong>In the near future, the eUA Portal will be upgraded and will also allow registration, tracking and implementation of proficiency exams for public servants.</p><p class="subtitle">JEP – Electronic Procedures Building Block</p><p>The <a href="http://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/jedro+elektronskih+postopkov+jep?lang=en">JEP System</a> is an information solution for the full and simultaneous electronic implementation of public procedures. The JEP performs the function of a procedure and form editor and also includes a wizard to fill out electronic forms, including the eSignature and ePayment functions. The JEP sends a completed user request to the competent public authority or allows authorities that do not have their own document management system to handle the application within the system itself. The JEP integrates building blocks for data exchange and trust services (see 6.3 and 6.4).</p><p class="subtitle">KRPAN – Document Management Building Block</p><p>With the <a href="http://nio.gov.si/nio/asset/informacijski+sistem+krpan?lang=en">KRPAN Information System</a>, Slovenia is introducing a single, technologically updated, flexible, easily scalable and advanced information solution for the public sector to support the management of documentary material installed on the central information infrastructure of the Ministry of Public Administration. It enables government employees to work with documentary material faster, more flexibly and more efficiently. The KRPAN Information System provides secure capture and management of original and copy documentary material in digital form. It supports the recording and management of general and administrative matters and document lists, supports work with government materials, with eInvoices and other financial accounting documents and travel orders.</p><p>The modular design of this solution is upgrade-friendly, i.e. it is suited to increase the number of users and the volume of data, to change and complement functionalities, to change the internal organisation of users and to connect with other information systems. It offers other information systems and individuals central functions, such as: capture of physical material, central numbering, signing of documents, validation and shipping of documents. For the purpose of safe and legal long-term storage, central storage of electronic material has been established within the project, which is also available to other State administration bodies’ information solutions. With the new unified information solution, user-friendly interface and mobile access, employees of the State administration get a unified, faster, cheaper and safer tool for working with documentary material. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474997"></a>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle">SEMPER</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/2018-eu-ia-0032">SEMPER</a> project aimed to provide solutions for cross-border powers of representation and eMandates. In particular, the project defined the semantic definitions of mandate attributes and enhance the eIDAS Interoperability Framework for connecting national mandate management infrastructures. </p><p>Service providers are able to allow the representation of legal or natural persons within their eIDAS enabled services as well as eIDAS node operators to access national mandate infrastructures as attribute providers (apart from connecting their national identity providers). The Ministry of Public Administration successfully explored the possibilities for carrying out eProcedures using the JEP with the SI-PASS services and platform. SEMPER was financed by CEF Telecom, 2018-EU-IA-0032. It successfully ended in February 2021. The results will be further explored during the implementation of the Single Digital Gateway Regulation.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk36733467"></a>TOOP</p><p><a href="https://www.toop.eu/">TOOP</a> aims to explore and showcase cross-border platforms while focusing on data from businesses. TOOP aims to enable better exchange of business‑related data or documents with and between public administrations and to reduce administrative burdens for both businesses and public administrations, following the Once-Only principle in a cross-border way. Through the project, the Ministry of Public Administration successfully implemented the pilot on business mobility eServices. The solution integrates the central TOOP solution with the national solution for data exchange Tray, following the Once-Only principle. Indeed, the portal serves as the main Once-Only platform for eServices at the national level.  </p><p>The TOOP project is funded by the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 737460. </p><p class="subtitle">DE4A</p><p><a href="https://www.de4a.eu/">Digital Europe for All</a> (DE4A) effectively puts forward a new Member State-driven large‑scale pilot aimed at ensuring compliance with the Single Digital Gateway and alignment with the EU eGovernment Action Plan 2016−2020, the Tallinn Declaration and the EIF Implementation Strategy. Its overarching goal is to reinforce trust in public institutions and to unleash multiple measurable positive impacts in terms of efficiency gains and reduction of current administrative burden and costs. </p><p>These goals are rooted in a toolkit for extended semantic interoperability and in the secure, privacy-preserving and trustworthy realisation of fundamental principles - such as the Once-Only (OOP), the Relevant-Only and the Digital by Default principles - through state-of-the-art, usable and high-quality fully online procedures accessible through the Single Digital Gateway (SDG). The Ministry of Public Administration takes part in the citizen mobility eService and contributes to the OOP development at EU level.</p><p>DE4A is funded by the EU Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No. 870635.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Beneficial Owners Register</p><p>In December 2017, the <a href="https://www.ajpes.si/Doc/AJPES/Dogodki/AJPES_Padova_Predstavitev20170712.pdf">Agency of the Republic of Slovenia for Public Legal Records and Related Services</a> (AJPES) established the <a href="https://www.schoenherr.si/beneficial-ownership-register-bor-in-slovenia/">Beneficial Owners Register</a> in cooperation with the <a href="http://www.uppd.gov.si/en/">Office for Money Laundering Prevention</a> of the Republic of Slovenia. The register was established based on the Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing. The Beneficial Owners Register is the main repository of beneficial ownership information, since the identification of a natural person that is owning or controlling a business entity is one of the conditions for the successful prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing. The purpose of establishing a Beneficial Owners Register was to ensure transparency in the ownership structures of business entities and to provide access to credible information for law enforcement authorities. Legal entities were obliged to enter the data on their beneficial owners until 19 January 2018. The purpose was to implement anti-money laundering and terrorism financing measures. Since then, public data about beneficial owners have been publicly accessible, with authorised entities having access to all data in the register.</p><p class="subtitle"><a href="http://www.fu.gov.si/fileadmin/Internet/Davki_in_druge_dajatve/Podrocja/Dohodnina/Dohodek_iz_dejavnosti/Opis/GB_Podrobnejsi_opis_3_izdaja_Brosura_za_sobodajalce_-_fizicne_osebe.docx">Register of Accommodation Facilities and eTourism</a> System</p><p>In December 2017, AJPES established the <a href="https://www.ajpes.si/Registri/Drugi_registri/Register_nastanitvenih_obratov/Splosno" target="_blank">Register of Accommodation Facilities and eTourism</a> System. The register was implemented on the legal basis of the Hospitality Industry Act and the eTourism System under the Residence Registration Act. The following three goals were achieved by the register and the eTourism System:</p><ul><li>Establishment of unique evidence of all accommodation facilities – the Register of Accommodation Facilities;</li><li>Unified reporting of guest book data from all accommodation facilities; and</li><li>Reduction of administrative burdens and costs for both reporters and recipients.</li></ul><p>The Register of Accommodation Facilities is publicly accessible free of charge on the AJPES web portal. To simplify the reporting of information and to increase the quality of the collected data, the owners of accommodation facilities report guest arrival information only once through the AJPES eTourism System. Previously, such reporting was carried out separately to the Police, the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia and the municipalities. With this new arrangement, AJPES provides collected data for the purpose of keeping records of guests, for statistical purposes and for tax collection purposes.</p><p class="subtitle">Slovenian Central Register of Population</p><p>Every Slovenian citizen has to register with the <a href="https://e-uprava.gov.si/podrocja/osebni-dokumenti-potrdila-selitev/potrdila-izpiski.html">Slovenian Central Register of Population (CRP)</a>.

Before beginning operations, a publisher/broadcaster must report their medium in the Ministry of Culture Register for the Media. The legal basis for establishing and managing the register comes from the Media Act, which sets rules for managing the register, as well as the procedure for registration and the transmission of data from the register. The purpose of the Register for the Media is to provide an overview of the media landscape and structure, as well as of the ownership of publishers/broadcasters in the Republic of Slovenia. </p><p class="subtitle">Registry of the Professional Titles in the Field of Cultural Heritage</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.si/en/state-authorities/ministries/ministry-of-culture/">Ministry of Culture</a> developed the so-called Registry of the Professional Titles in the Field of Cultural Heritage. This registry includes all the titles and professions associated with cultural heritage -including the job of museum curator, conservator and conservator-restorer of cultural artifacts - and is a tool to assist people who envisage one of the above‑mentioned professions. The support ranges from receiving applications to starting courses to receive a certification in one of those fields. The registry also helps tracking workers’ progress in their profession and their advancement/promotion. An official title is awarded to people who pass the official exam, which is also tracked in the REMK application.
