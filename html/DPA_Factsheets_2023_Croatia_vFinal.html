The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-886.x-emf" alt="32-886.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Croatia in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-887.x-emf" alt="32-887.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Croatia’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring at the European average for most of the Principles and higher than the EU average for Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility). Room for improvement is available under Principle 5 (Technological neutrality and data portability) for which the score of 2 shows a medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the country should not impose any technological solutions on citizens, businesses and other administrations that are technology-specific or disproportionate to their real needs (Principle 5 – Recommendation 08). </p><p><img src="img/32-888.x-emf" alt="32-888.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022 </a></p><p>The Croatian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance with mostly scores of 4. The only potential area of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 is concentrated on interoperability governance, where Croatia scored 3. The lower score is due to the lower score for Recommendation 24, whereby Croatia should improve its participation in standardisation work relevant to citizens’ or businesses’ needs, to ensure that their requirements are met. </p><p><img src="img/32-889.x-emf" alt="32-889.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Croatia’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a medium performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with different parameters, namely base registries, catalogues and security and privacy. To align with the European average, Croatia could improve the implementation of the recommendations related to Base Registries, by publishing the semantic and technical means and documentation needed for others to connect and reuse available information (Recommendation 38) and matching each base registry with appropriate metadata including the description of its content, service assurance and responsibilities, etc. </p><p><img src="img/32-890.x-emf" alt="32-890.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Croatia concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at least upper-middle performance of the country in 13 indicators. Particularly, Croatia has a high performance with the maximum score of four in Principle 2, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11 as well as in integrated public services governance, legal, semantic and technical interoperability, and open data (i.e. Recommendation 41, 42 and 43). However, Croatia has still margin for improvement in relation to three indicators where the country obtains a low performance. For instance, efforts could focus on technological neutrality and data portability (i.e. Principle 5), and on the development of a shared infrastructure of reusable services and information sources that can be used by all public administrations (i.e. Recommendation 36).</p><p>Additional information on Croatia’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through interactive dashboards.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><p><img src="img/32-891.png" alt="32-891.png" /></p><h1><a id="_Toc140671339"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications<a id="_Toc1474951"></a></h1><h2>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Croatian government signed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other EU Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies.

Namely, the transition to a sustainable and inclusive economic model based on the wider acceptance and use of digital and clean technologies is defined as a priority of public policies in the NDS. The NDS states that strategic digital capacities need to be strengthened and built by monitoring the development of digital services and digital transformation. Additionally, the further development of the State information infrastructure and the increased availability of interoperable digital public services to citizens and businesses are also seen as important.

An appropriate foundation, i.e. a comprehensive strategic framework, was needed to create the prerequisites for a coherent and efficient information system, and the provision of high-quality and economical electronic public administration services at the national and European level. </p><p>The <a href="https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2023_01_2_17.html">Strategy for Digital Croatia 2032</a> defines the vision of a country improved by digital transformation and positions Croatia as an economically competitive country on the digital map of Europe. It identifies key challenges, development needs and potentials, and singles out concrete priority areas through four strategic goals: (i) an innovative digital economy; (ii) a digitalised public administration; (iii) available and used large-capacity networks; and (iv) digital competencies for living and working in the digital age. The strategy was defined through a participatory method - a wide range of interested stakeholders, representatives of public authorities, civil sector organisations, representatives of the academic community and economic operators were involved in its development, with a total of 140 participants from more than 40 institutions.</p><p class="subtitle">Implementation Programme of the Central State Office for the Development of the Digital Society for the Period 2021–2024</p><p>The <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/SDURDD-dokumenti/Provedbeni program SDURDD 2021 2024.pdf">Implementation Programme of the CSODDS for the period 2021–2024</a> is a programme detailing activities aimed at the digitalisation of all parts of society, and promoting a balanced and inclusive development of the digital society for citizens, economic operators and the public administration. In the coming period, the focus will be on activities related to: (i) improving the security and coordination of the digital society; (ii) further developing public eServices; (iii) developing the State information infrastructure; (iv) improving the interoperability of information systems; (v) ensuring unique, permanent availability of public official documents and information of the Republic of Croatia; (vi) monitoring the implementation of the Law on Accessibility of Web Pages and Mobile Software Solutions of Public Sector Bodies; and (vii) promoting and improving the position of women in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">National Recovery and Resilience Plan</p><p>The proposed reform aimed at <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/npoo/uspostava-sredisnjeg-sustava-interoperabilnosti/1995">improving the interoperability of information systems</a> will focus on the further development of public services and the national information infrastructure, as well as on the establishment of a central interoperability system. This initiative will also contribute to the goal of the European Data Strategy of creating a single data market and to the smooth flow of data across various sectors at the EU, but also at the Croatian, level, to the benefit of companies, researchers and public administration. </p><p>The goal is to establish the interoperability of public registers and information systems, and implement a central data warehouse and a platform for the exchange of Internet of Things (IoT) data. The introduction of a centralised IoT integration platform would enable the central collection and sharing of large amounts of data from various sensors, and make all necessary tools available to the public and private sectors. The platform would be able to host applications whose function is to process and share available data in real time.</p><p class="subtitle">National Development Strategy 2030</p><p>In the NDS, under the strategic goal ‘Digital transition of society and economy’, investments in the State information infrastructure will continue in order to facilitate the development of new business models based on digital technologies by introducing interoperable solutions. </p><p class="subtitle">Strategy for Digital Croatia 2032</p><p>The Strategy for Digital Croatia 2032 envisages the further development of a national interoperability framework, including a complete connection of the basic registers of all departments with a greater degree of inter-institutional cooperation and coordination. It is mentioned that one of the key development prerequisites for further accelerated digitalisation of public administration is precisely the upgrade and connection of basic registers within the interoperability framework of the central system, as well as the implementation of a central data warehouse through a greater degree of inter-institutional cooperation and coordination.</p><p>Also, eServices for entrepreneurship need to be further developed and a further opening of public services to entrepreneurs is planned in order to provide a better foundation for the development of new business models as well as new products and services.<br />Furthermore, the existing national Open Data Portal, which will contain high-value data and be based on the interoperability of public data of the Republic of Croatia, needs to be improved. Through the use of digital disruptive technologies, such as AI and machine learning, companies have already used it in a test environment and will use it in the future in a real environment for the development of innovations.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3>Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle">Open Data Policy</p><p>On 19 July 2018, the government of the Republic of Croatia adopted the <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/SDURDD-dokumenti/POLITIKA OTVORENIH PODATAKA.pdf">Open Data Policy</a>. The Open Data Policy provides the strategic direction for further development of the policy of openness and transparency of public administration.

Its purpose was a systematic and coordinated implementation of activities necessary to raise the capacity of the Republic of Croatia in the field of cybersecurity, in order to build a safe society in the cyberspace. The general aim of this strategy was also to exploit the market potential of the information society, in particular of cybersecurity products and services. Since it was the first comprehensive strategy in the Republic of Croatia in the field of cybersecurity, the primary objective in this context was to identify organisational problems in its implementation and raise awareness in society about the importance of this issue. </p><p>Following the adoption of the EU’s Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade, the revision of the National Strategy on Cybersecurity and the accompanying Action Plan have begun. The revisions were expected to be completed in 2022. However, due to the delay in the adoption (in December 2022) of the EU Digital Decade Policy Programme 2030 and Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS2 Directive), which have a significant impact on all national strategies, the Republic of Croatia will continue this work in 2023. </p><p>In 2017, the government of the Republic of Croatia renewed its <a href="https://www.uvns.hr/en/legislation/national-security">National Security Strategy</a>. Its strategic goals are: (i) achieving the highest level of population and critical infrastructure security and protection; (ii) establishing and developing a homeland security system; (iii) developing and maintaining a strong and active defence; (iv) developing a strong and sustainable economy, demographic renewal and revitalisation of the Croatian society; (v) developing a citizen-friendly public administration and strategic communication; (vi) protecting, strengthening and promoting the highest constitutional values and the Croatian national identity; and (vii) increasing the international reputation and influence of the Republic of Croatia. In this context, the Republic of Croatia will develop measures to strengthen the resilience of information and communication systems in cyberspace as well as to mitigate the negative consequences of any threats or disruptions thereto. The emphasis is on the key systems needed for the normal functioning of State institutions as well as the storage, transmission and exchange of citizens classified and personal data. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of Base Registries</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">eProcurement Process</p><p>The NRRP addresses the importance of further digitisation and automation of the eProcurement process by ensuring the appropriate environment for economic entities participating in public procurement procedures.

It is developed in accordance with the relevant legislative framework for the system of strategic planning and development management of the Republic of Croatia, as well as with the legislative and regulatory framework in the field of electronic communications. The plan is influenced by the EU strategic goals for broadband access in the period up to 2025 (see Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Connectivity for a Competitive Single Digital<br />Market - Towards a European Gigabit Society (COM/2016/0587 final)).</p><p class="subtitle">National Health Development Plan 2021–2027 </p><p><a href="https://zdravlje.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/2022 Objave/Nacionalni plan razvoja zdravstva 2021.-2027..pdf">The National Health Development Plan 2021–2027</a> was adopted at the session of the government of the Republic of Croatia of 30 December 2021 as an umbrella sectoral planning document that establishes specific goals, measures, projects and activities that will be implemented under the auspices of the Ministry of Health with the basic goal of improving the health system and health outcomes for the population. It builds on the NDS, which, within the framework of strategic goal 5 ‘Healthy, active and quality life’, plans to improve the healthcare system and care outcomes as a key national priority. As part of it, five special goals are set: (i) better healthy lifestyle habits and more effective disease prevention; (ii) improvement of the healthcare system; (iii) improvement of the model of care for key health challenges; (iv) the healthcare system as a desirable place to work; and (v) improvement of the financial sustainability of the healthcare system. </p><p>The National Health Development Plan is aligned with the NDS, the Programme of the government of the Republic of Croatia, the NRRP 2021-2026 and the European Commission’s Cohesion Policy Guidelines for the period 2021–2027.</p><p class="subtitle">National Plan for Work, Protection at Work and Employment 2021–2027 </p><p>As part of the active employment policy, the <a href="https://zdravlje.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/2022 Objave/Nacionalni plan razvoja zdravstva 2021.-2027..pdf">National Plan</a> for Work, Protection at Work and Employment 2021–2027 pays special attention to improving the position of women, young people, long-term unemployed, Croatian veterans and other vulnerable groups on the labour market. It also aims at improving the skills and knowledge of the working population with an emphasis on digital and green skills. Moreover, the capacities of institutions on the labour market are strengthened to ensure quality provision of services to users.</p><p>In order to achieve the strategic goal defined by the NDS, one of the main priorities of public policy is to harmonise education with the labour market, and develop the skills and knowledge necessary for the digital and green transitions. Knowledge and skills must respond to the changing demands of the workplace, taking into account the transition towards a digitalised and green economy. One of the factors that influence the lack of the necessary knowledge and skills is the low rate of participation in adult education, as well as insufficient awareness of the importance of lifelong professional guidance and career development. According to Eurostat data (Research on the use of ICT11 in households and individuals), 53% of the population have a certain level of development of digital skills. This percentage is almost the same as the EU-27, but insufficient for the development of the green and digital economy. In this context, an important mechanism in bridging the mismatch between supply and demand in the labour market are education and training programmes provided through the voucher system. </p><p>Furthermore, another priority of public policy is certainly the activation of inactive persons of working age, given that the activity rate in the Republic of Croatia is lower than the activity rate in the EU, amounting in 2020 to 71.9% and 77.7%, respectively.</p><p>The performance of work via digital platforms, as a relative novelty on the world labour market, including the Croatian, is not part of the aforementioned national plan. However, bearing in mind that such a specific way of working is rapidly expanding and growing, especially after the global health and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 epidemic, promptly reacting and regulating relationships that are not at all or insufficiently regulated by national legislation is important, as the lack of regulation can lead to new important imbalances and disturbances in the labour market. At the same time, regulation needs to make sure that innovative forms of work that have a positive effect on employment and the activity of the workforce are not prevented. </p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-895.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The education system is increasingly part of the digital transformation. If used competently, fairly and effectively in teaching, digital technology can in every way enable high-quality and inclusive education and training, and be a stimulating tool for collaborative and creative learning. Therefore, a special set of measures are aimed at supporting the green and digital transition in education and training.</p><p>In March 2020, the Ministry of Science and Education adopted and published on its website the <a href="https://mzo.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/PristupInformacijama/Strateski-digitalno2030/Strateski okvir za digitalno sazrijevanje skola i skolskog sustava u Republici Hrvatskoj - 2030.pdf">Strategic Framework for the Digital Maturation of Schools and the School System in the Republic of Croatia by 2030</a>. Digital technologies are at the very core of introducing innovations into the learning and teaching system. Due to their intensive development, they require continuous investment in equipment and people to maintain the required level. Although the digital maturity of schools is gradually being improved by eSchool projects, further investments are necessary for the long-term transformation of the system. These investments add to national projects focused on infrastructure, tools and professional training, as well as the application of new technological solutions (especially AI) as a prerequisite for future development and improvement of the quality and fairness of the education system. The strategic framework identifies four strategic areas which are important for the digital transformation of the education system: (i) digitally mature environment; (ii) digitally mature and confident teachers; (iii) support to learning and teaching using ICT; and (iv) managing and making decisions based on data.</p><p>The challenges in terms of the infrastructure necessary to ensure the improvement of the conditions for the application of digital technologies in the education system are visible in the new goals set by the EU for its members. For instance, one of the three strategic goals of the EU’s Digital Single Market is achieving access to all schools in the EU at speeds of at least 1 Gbps until 2025. In addition, also the EU’s projections in the Digital Data Strategy on the growth of the amount of data from 2018 to 2025 by 530% show that constant investments in school infrastructure are needed to support digital processes transformations.</p><p class="subtitle">Implementation Programme of the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development 2021–2024 </p><p><a href="https://mingor.gov.hr/UserDocsImages//GLAVNO TAJNIÅ TVO/Strategija, planovi i ostali dokumenti//Provedbeni program Ministarstva gospodarstva i odrÅ¾ivog razvoja za razdoblje 2021. â 2024. godine.pdf"><a href="https://mingor.gov.hr/UserDocsImages//GLAVNO TAJNIÅ TVO/Strategija, planovi i ostali dokumenti//Provedbeni program Ministarstva gospodarstva i odrÅ¾ivog razvoja za razdoblje 2021. â 2024. godine.pdf">The Implementation Programme of the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development 2021–2024</a></a> will carry on the ongoing processes aimed at development and sustainability, primarily targeting the preservation of jobs, the strengthening of social security, economic recovery and a good business environment.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle">Statement on Cooperation for Artificial Intelligence</p><p>In July 2018, the Minister of the Economy, Entrepreneurship and Crafts signed a Statement on Cooperation in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

Although the Public Procurement Act has already introduced a new ‘Innovation Partnership’ procurement procedure to allow contracting entities to carry out procurement procedures for innovative goods, services or works, its use should be encouraged by raising the level of knowledge of all stakeholders in public procurement. To that end, the reform focuses on the use of public procurement for innovative solutions, i.e. encouraging the public sector to procure the latest technological solutions, strengthening the public procurement framework related to innovation, strengthening the capacities of procurement procedures, and raising awareness among interested public and private sector stakeholders about innovation procurement. </p><p>Efficient public procurement is also one of the main prerequisites for one of the priority areas of the Strategy for Digital Croatia 2032, i.e. ‘Achieving full interoperability of public administration while enabling access to open data for citizens and businesses’. Legal provisions will be harmonised in order to incorporate interoperability standards into public procurement procedures with a view to encouraging the procurement of interoperable IT solutions.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2022_10_114_1740.html">amendments to the Law on Amendments to the Law on Public Procurement</a> (OJ 114/22) adopted in 2022, complaints are now submitted by electronic means of communication through the interconnected information systems of the State Commission and the EOJN of the Republic of Croatia.</p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing </p><p>In the eInvoicing area, Croatia surpassed the EU average by 10.8 percentage points in 2021. This result is largely due to two developments. The first is the contactless way of doing business during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Description automatically generated" />eCitizen Portal</p><p>By setting up the eCitizen system, a major step was taken to modernise public services and to bring public administration closer to citizens. </p><p>Since the beginning of its operation until the end of December 2021, unique users of the eCitizen system amounted to 1 720 201 and logins to the available eServices totalled as many as 119 487 359. By the end of 2022, 99 eServices were available to citizens on the <a href="https://gov.hr">eCitizen Portal</a>. The total number of eServices available on the eCitizen Portal in 2022 was nominally reduced because of optimisation and consolidation of existing eServices into new portal eServices. </p><p>An integral component of the eCitizen Portal is the National Identification and Authentication System (NIAS) that serves as a secure and reliable identification and authentication mechanism for citizens who access public eServices through the appropriate credentials. Another integral part is the User Mailbox, where public institutions can send 122 kinds of personalised messages with various information and notifications, such as information about the expiration of personal documents, individual documents and the status of individual proceedings.</p><p>On 3 May 2021, the redesigned eCitizen Portal was released to the public. The redesign process was guided by an agile project management methodology, and the redesign itself was aimed at improving the portal user experience, as well as improving the interface clarity, simplicity and usability. All pages are equally usable regardless of the device through which the citizen accesses them (computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.). The redesign also introduced a new central component, the Navigation Bar, as part of a single user interface in all public eServices, whether for individuals or business users. The Navigation Bar allows users to easily and quickly select the entity <a id="_Hlk97039974"></a>on whose behalf they want to act and use the selected eService (business users for their businesses and parents for their children). The selection of the entity on whose behalf the user wants to act is retrieved automatically from public registers.</p><p>During 2022, the CSODDS continued to perform tasks related to the creation, management and maintenance of eServices in the eCitizen system and to support the work of the agile team which is working on the redesign and further improvement of the eCitizen system. The new eServices implemented in the eCitizen system during 2022 were: </p><ul><li>eEnforcement, i.e. a service enabling the submission of motions for enforcement to municipal courts on the basis of an authentic document;</li><li>My eCulture, i.e. a service providing access to digitised material intended for citizens, scientists and the academic community;</li><li>eServices of the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute, i.e. a service enabling the submission of requests for the exercise of various rights, namely rights from pension insurance, child allowance, national allowance or issuance of portable document A1; </li><li>eProcedures related to membership of the Croatian Chamber of Psychotherapists which provides the option of submitting requests for registration in the directories, registers, and records maintained by the Croatian Chamber of Psychotherapists; </li><li>Register of Auditors, i.e. a service enabling individuals and legal entities to submit requests for registration and for issuing certificates for auditors;</li><li>Mandatory Fee Payment Calendar, i.e. a service enabling business entities to review the fees and taxes they are obliged to pay, with the amounts and deadlines for their settlement, and to prepare data/orders for payment;</li><li>eRequest, i.e. a service enabling the submission of a request for a water permit for the discharge of wastewater and the use of water; and</li><li>Single Information Point of the Cadastre Infrastructure System, i.e. a service enabling users to issue documents, and search metadata and spatial data of the cadastre infrastructure.</li></ul><p>The Strategy for Digital Croatia 2032 calls for further digitisation of public services as one of the key strategic guidelines for the transformation of public administration. The goal is to digitise all key public services that solve complete life situations, which will represent the strategic direction of the future development of eServices.</p><p>In 2022, the implementation of the relevant investment under the NRRP began.

Its main goal is to achieve financial and time savings for businesses, and increase the availability of public services and efficiency of public administration while strengthening the capacity of officials and employees.</p><p>The components of the eBusiness project, which are also integral component of the State Information Infrastructure, are: the eCitizen Portal (Gov.hr) with public information and electronic services for businesses, the NIAS with a new subsystem of eAuthorisation for a single login to eServices for business users and the Navigation Bar as part of a common user interface of eServices. The Navigation Bar enables users to choose the business entity on whose behalf they wish to act, and also contains the link to the User Mailbox (KP) for secure and reliable communication with individual business entities. It is connected with various business registers. Users authorised to represent legal entities are automatically retrieved trough the Navigation Bar from several registers: the Court Register, the Registers of Non-profit Organisations (Register of Associations, Foundations, Political Parties and Religious Communities), the Trade Register for Crafts, the Register of Farmers and Family Farms, and the Register of Budgetary Users. In addition, the persons authorised to represent may, through the eAuthorisation and its ePower of Attorney form, grant the right of access to other persons within their business entity or other persons in another business entity. This functionality provides all business users with the necessary flexibility while accessing to and using the public eServices available.</p><p>The project ended in October 2022 and all key performance indicators (KPI) of the project were fulfilled. At the project finalisation, the platform included 13 public eServices intended for business entities, which are provided by eight bodies and institutions within their jurisdiction. For this purpose, training was also offered to more than 45 employees from over 20 public bodies. </p><p class="subtitle">Information Catalogue</p><p>eInformation, or the Information Catalogue, has been part of the eCitizen system since April 2021.

The topics and areas covered are active citizenship and leisure, health, finance and taxes, family and life, work, Croatian veterans, citizenship and documents, education, rule of law and security, housing and environment, transport and vehicles, and business. The goal is to provide access to information on public services in one place, without the need to log in to the eCitizen portal, which puts users and their needs first.</p><p>Pursuant to the <a href="https://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2017_06_60_1362.html">Decree on Organisational and Technical Standards for Connecting to the State Information Infrastructure </a>(OJ 60/17), the Office of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia coordinated the inclusion of the website of public sector bodies in the Central State Portal ‘gov.hr’.</p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-904.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The grant agreement from the European Social Fund for the project was signed in August 2021, for a project duration of 24 months. The total value of this project is HRK 3 749 983 (EUR 497 708.28), of which up to 85% is co-financed through the European Social Fund. The project partner in the implementation of this project is the Office for Legislation of the Government of the Republic of Croatia (UZZ). </p><p>During 2022, an expert working group was established in which representatives discussed about challenges in working with the system, necessary upgrades and further process improvement. An analysis of the existing system was carried out, including the analysis of the system’s current functionalities and their use, a stakeholder analysis and identification of the need for consultations.

COP is a web-based application, providing salary calculations for the whole public administration, which gives the government of Croatia the possibility to manage the system. It also provides exact data to the government over salaries paid by all bodies. COP became fully operational in 2018, with 2 122 registered institutions as COP beneficiaries.</p><p>Activities are currently ongoing regarding the NRRP project ‘Improvement of the salary system in State administration and public services’ (C2.2.R2-I1).

The system is almost fully read-only, with interactive functions like messaging between patients and their GPs as well as selected dentists and gynaecologists, as well as requesting ePrescriptions for chronical conditions.</p><p>Importantly, the system allows for each individual to manage the access rights to their clinical data for other authorised users within primary care, using the Opt-In method. Using the settings dashboard, patients can grant access to their selected dentist, emergency services, specialists in the outpatient settings and pharmacists. They can also authorise the cross-border sharing of information with EU Member States, as part of the Patient Cross-Border Rights Directive (2011/24/EU). </p><p>In 2021, additional COVID-19 related functionalities were added to access and review patient data on all COVID-19 vaccinations and tests, and to allow scheduling the slot for vaccination (1<sup>st</sup> dose, 2<sup>nd</sup> dose, boosters) against COVID-19 by selecting the desired location and date of vaccination.</p><p>Activities are currently ongoing under the NRRP project ‘<a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/npoo/konsolidacija-sustava-zdravstvene-informacijske-infrastrukture-cezih/2000">Consolidation of the CEZIH health information infrastructure system</a>’. The CEZIH health information infrastructure system is intended for all stakeholders of the health system: hospitals, general family medicine, paediatrics, gynaecology, dentistry, school medicine, public health institutions, the Ministry of Health, the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, pharmacies and laboratories. The system should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This investment aims to achieve the following goals:</p><ul><li>Enabling continuous, reliable and secure operation of the central health information system;</li><li>Establishing primary and secondary locations for infrastructure while meeting TIER 3 reliability and availability standards; and</li><li>Securing data (backup) and monitoring the operation of the system.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Central Catalogue of Official Documents of the Republic of Croatia</p><p>The CSODDS is responsible for managing the <a href="https://sredisnjikatalogrh.gov.hr/">Central Catalogue of Official Documents of the Republic of Croatia</a>, a tool available to the public providing permanent access to the documents published by the national administration.

The platform is integrated into the NIAS and, as a result, citizens can access it via the 27 credentials available on the NIAS.</p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>HITRONet and CARNET</p><p><a href="https://www.hitro.hr/">HITRONet</a> was established following the decision of the government of the Republic of Croatia on the establishment and provision of common services of computer and communication network for State administration bodies in 2007. Currently, 506 public bodies are connected through the HITRONet infrastructure. The network is regularly maintained and monitored based on its traffic load. This network provides access to the internet and secure interconnection of the involved institutions. It also enables the institutions of the Republic of Croatia to join EU-wide services provided through the latest generation of TESTAng networks as a common network of EU Member States. Through the HITRONet network, Croatian bodies use over 17 different services provided by the European Commission to Member States.</p><p>In addition to locations connected via HITRONet, some sites of public law bodies are connected to the CARNET network. CARNET is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Science and Education. It is a private network of the Croatian academic and scientific research community, and institutions from the elementary and secondary education system. The CARNET facility owns part of the network infrastructure and mainly leases lines from a range of telecommunications providers.</p><p>Activities are currently ongoing under the NRRP project ‘<a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/npoo/ulaganja-u-mreze-drzavne-informacijske-infrastrukture/2001">Investments in State information infrastructure networks</a>’. To improve the operation of the network used by public bodies in Croatia, a new network architecture will be designed that will meet the needs emerging in the coming period, the existing equipment will be upgraded and the capacities of telecommunication links between network nodes will be increased. All bodies will be provided with broadband access to a high-capacity network (10 Gbps). The goals of this investment are:</p><ul><li>Establishing a secure network infrastructure at existing and new locations where institutions provide services to citizens and/or business entities;</li><li>Ensuring network capacities appropriate to the needs of the modern information society; and</li><li>Increasing the security of the entire State Information Infrastructure.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">eBulletin Board and Court Networking Project </p><p>The <a href="https://e-oglasna.pravosudje.hr/">eBulletin Board and Court Networking Project </a>was initiated to develop a single intranet and internet network for judicial bodies, which will create the prerequisites for the exchange of documents and information within the judiciary. </p><p>The eBulletin Board is a free and public service that enables the overview of electronic bulletin boards of courts and other competent authorities in the Republic of Croatia. The central search engine enables to look for published decisions and other documents of municipal, county, commercial and administrative courts in the Republic of Croatia, as well as the enforcement proceedings of FINA and public notaries. All notifications by the competent authorities are published without delay and automatically removed upon expiry.</p><p>The Ministry of Justice and Administration, as the highest judicial administration body, provides the technical preconditions for the information system described. All recorded information is within the jurisdiction of the courts in which the proceedings are conducted. </p><p class="subtitle">Broadband Infrastructure</p><p>In order to achieve the full potential of digital transformation, the Republic of Croatia has provided significant resources for the promotion of broadband infrastructure. With the aim of removing the existing barriers to investing in the mobile network market and enabling the increase of the investment potential of public mobile network operators, the Republic of Croatia has abolished one-off fees for the use of the radio frequency spectrum for public mobile networks. Furthermore, the annual fee for the use of the radio frequency spectrum (1900 MHz - 1920 MHz) has also been abolished, thus opening up the possibility of new market investments and competitiveness. Also, A mechanism has been introduced by virtue of which an equal annual fee for the use of the unused radio frequency spectrum will apply to all operators of public mobile networks in the Republic of Croatia.</p><p>One of the key projects in the area of connectivity is the <a href="https://nop.hakom.hr/">National Framework Programme for the Development of Broadband Infrastructure</a> in areas where there is insufficient commercial interest to invest, managed by the Croatian Regulatory Authority for Network Industries (HAKOM). The aim of this framework programme is to develop the Next Generation Access (NGA) Broadband Infrastructure in areas where there is insufficient commercial interest for operators and market providers to invest. The programme is a national framework scheme, which follows a number of individual projects in a narrower local area. Individual projects are managed by public authorities at local and/or regional level (municipalities, cities and counties) as individual project promoters. </p><p>Another key project is the <a href="https://mmpi.gov.hr/vijesti-8/vlada-rh-usvojen-nacionalni-program-razvoja-sirokopojasne-agregacijske-infrastrukture-u-podrucjima-u-kojima-ne-postoji-dostatan-komercijalni-interes-za-ulaganja-np-bbi-program/6950">National Broadband Aggregation Infrastructure Development Programme</a> in areas where there is insufficient commercial interest to invest (NP–BBI). The NP-BBI Programme is focused on building the Next Generation Network (NGN) Broadband Infrastructure and is complementary to the National Framework Programme. The programme’s feasibility study is currently in the approval phase by JASPERS. The design and construction activities are expected to last until the end of 2023.</p><p class="subtitle">Development of the 5G Network</p><p>Croatia is one of the first EU countries which have tested the 5G network. The planned start of operation of the first 5G commercial networks was foreseen for 2020. At present, the IoT technology is also available in Croatia and is used in intelligent smart cities solutions (for example, smart parking). In this context, Ericsson Nikola Tesla opened a research and development centre in Osijek, where experts will be engaged in the development of the new 5G technology.</p><p>With the purpose of recognising the challenges and constraints of introducing the 5G network in Croatia, HAKOM has set up a working group with electronic communications operators. The working group has the task of articulating the challenges regarding the introduction of 5G technology, as well as the involvement of all public and private stakeholders that can contribute to successfully carrying out the 5G action plan.</p><p>Within the <a href="https://hrvatska2030.hr/">NDS</a>, digitalisation is one of the key items and this area is addressed by a special technical working group for the digital society. The working group encourages the introduction of 5G networks through various measures and activities. This is also part of the new draft proposal for a Law on Electronic Communications transposing Directive (EU) 2018/1972 establishing the European Electronic Communications Code (EECC), which is currently being prepared.</p><p>The <a href="https://mmpi.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/PROMET/Promet 3_21/MMPI-NPR-BB2021-2027-VRH 11-3_21.pdf">National Plan for the Development of Broadband Internet Access in the Republic of Croatia 2021–2027</a> (OJ 26/2021) was adopted in March 2021 and has as one of the goals the introduction of 5G networks in accordance with the EECC, the 5G Action Plan of the European Commission and the European Commission Communication entitled ‘Towards a European Gigabit Society’. This goal includes the introduction of 5G networks for urban areas and major land routes, as well as the introduction of 5G networks for rural areas.</p><p>As of January 2022, commercial 5G was available in all 27 EU Member States. The Hrvatski Telekom’s 5G network is based on the use of the Dynamic Spectrum Sharing (DSS) technology to make use of the 2100 MHz band, and the newly acquired 700 MHz and 3600 MHz bands. Its 5G network currently covers 45 Croatian cities and a population of 1.7 million.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Shared Services Centre</p><p>The national <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/uspostava-centra-dijeljenih-usluga/1596">Shared Services Centre (SSC)</a>, i.e. the State cloud, is one of the key projects that will integrate the State information infrastructure, and enable the sharing of ICT and the same horizontal application solutions. All public sector bodies will be able to use shared, reliable and scalable ICT infrastructure according to the cloud paradigm. Through the SSC, the State will gain faster access to the latest technologies that are the basis for providing more digital public administration services in the most efficient way and in the shortest possible time.</p><p>The project will result in the consolidation of the State information infrastructure, based on the principles of the shared services model. Moreover, it will aim at the implementation of an infrastructure for an interconnectivity and interoperability platform that will include key enablers required for the Metaregister, the GSB, the distributed eServices architecture and State platforms. The development of shared services will also be pursued.</p><p>The Shared Services Centre was officially launched on 25 November 2019. The project received a grant of HRK 306 644 668.87 from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) through the 2014–2020 Operational Programme ‘Competitiveness and Cohesion’. The total project value is HRK 360 758 433.97 and the project will last until 31 December 2023.</p><p>During 2022, an additional 150 users (institutions) were integrated in the SSC. As a result, at the end of 2022 the SSC had a total of 383 users, which is over the needed KPI for the project.</p><p>In the NRRP, further development of new functionalities of the SSC is planned trough the project ‘<a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/npoo/nadogradnja-centra-dijeljenih-usluga/1997">Further development of the Shared Services Centre’.</a> A goal was set to expand the cloud with 450 new users (institutions) by 2026. The project also envisages the establishment of six new functionalities/services: (i) Platform as a Service (PaaS), for establishing the development/implementation environment; (ii) the Central Information Security Monitoring System (SIEM); (iii) a platform for the contact centre for the reporting of ICT tickets; (iv) a platform for biometric authentication; (v) a platform for content managing; and (vi) a platform for blockchain.</p><p class="subtitle">Government Service Bus</p><p>The development of the<a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/interoperabilnost-sustava-javne-uprave-drzavna-sabirnica-gsb/1873"> Central Interoperability System</a> is part of establishing the SSC. The GSB, as a main component of the Central Interoperability System, enables safe and secure data exchange among services and registers. SSC service users are able to announce the GSB interface in two ways: (i) putting an interface directly into the GSB network and announce the application programming interface (API) in the GSB API catalogue to enable that interface to be reused by other SSC platforms; and (ii) developing an interface on the GSB platform to enable further orchestration and data manipulation. </p><p>The process of integrating public registers in the GSB started to develop a complex electronic registration and enrolment eService in educational institutions. This project envisages the integration of eight registers (veterans, birth, residence, etc.) through the GSB. The process includes the publication of the application service (API) on the GSB and the use of this application service in order to retrieve data from public registers.</p><p>The second eService that is important in this context is eRenovation, i.e. a digital system that enables the submission of requests for renovation attaching all necessary documentation, monitors the implementation of the renovation procedure, displays renewal data on the Geoportal and provides reports according to various criteria.</p><p>In 2022, 17 new institutions were integrated in the GSB presenting (exposing) 15 registers and records to the GSB to ensure secure data exchange between State bodies and institutions. As a result, registers in the GSB production environment now total 38. In 2022, 110 new institutions retrieving data for their business processes were also integrated into the GSB. In total, 123 bodies now obtain data through the GSB, i.e. ten times more than in 2021. Also, a total of 71 web services/APIs were integrated for data download in the same year. Web services now amount to 110 in total, with an increase of almost three times compared to 2021. Finally, in 2022 a total of 7 113 855 inquiry messages were sent through the GSB and an equal number of responses were delivered to institutions for the completion of business processes (production environment), which makes data exchange ten times higher than in 2021.</p><p>The projects eEnrolment, eTourism, eRenovation, and Asset Records for the State Attorney’s Council and for the State Judicial Council are the biggest beneficiaries of the integration of registers at the GSB level. </p><p class="subtitle">Improving the System of Electronic Services</p><p>The project ‘<a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/unaprjedjenje-sustava-elektronickih-usluga/344">Improving the system of electronic services</a>’, aimed at defining the standard for the development of new eServices and continuous digitalisation of public administration operations, was completed in February 2021.

It aims to implement the standard through the establishment of appropriate tools and process digitalisation. </p><p>The project will establish an information system that will support all processes defined within the eStandard to ensure a clear picture of the development status of eServices. It will enable all stakeholders to monitor in one central repository the development status of each eService, as well as the availability of all documents and artifacts that are created through eServices development projects. </p><p>A portal with all important information on the development of eServices will be established, standardised user interfaces (graphic design) will be developed as building blocks for the development of eServices, and rules and guidelines for developing graphic interfaces will be adopted. Also, life situations will be analysed and their register created. Based on the latter, the priorities and the needs of citizens and business entities will be defined in order to develop or improve eServices that target those needs.</p><p class="subtitle">National Spatial Data Infrastructure</p><p>For centuries spatial data have been interpreted and visualised on analogue maps, which until recently were the main tool for the perception, understanding and orientation of objects and events in space. The appearance and development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), however, have opened up new possibilities of managing spatial data and their characteristics.</p><p>Standardised data can be more easily exploited by users in order to promote a faster and more efficient regional economic development. In addition, the financial savings that can be achieved in the process place new demands on spatial data. Thus, in order to speed up development in this field, Europe has launched the INSPIRE initiative, linking together the national spatial data infrastructures. The Croatian <a href="http://www.nipp.hr/">National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) </a>is defined as a set of technologies, measures, standards, implementation rules, services, human resources and other factors enabling efficient integration, management and maintenance of the sharing of spatial data. It gives the possibility to discover, view and use spatial data to government bodies, businesses, non-commercial and public sector entities, the academic community and citizens in general. The NSDI will be an integral part of the European Spatial Data Infrastructure defined by the INSPIRE Directive. It will have to be harmonised with the development of spatial data infrastructures at the European (INSPIRE) and global (GSDI, UN-GGIM) level. Moreover, the infrastructure at national level will also need to influence the development of spatial data infrastructures at the local level.</p><p>The <a href="https://ispu.mgipu.hr/#/">Spatial Planning Information System (ISPU)</a> is a State interoperable and multi-platform system for input, verification, publication and exchange of spatial data for the purposes of creating, adopting, implementing and monitoring spatial plans, as well as permanently monitoring the situation in the space and in the area of spatial planning. The ISPU is organised as a system of independent functional units - modules for entering and verifying data. </p><p>On 7 November 2019 the Ministry of Spatial Planning, Construction and State Property signed the Agreement on the allocation of grants for projects financed from the European Structural and Investment Funds in the financial period 2014–2020 for the purpose of implementing the project entitled ‘<a href="https://mpgi.gov.hr/eu-sufinanciranja/ispu-i-razvoj-e-usluga/projekt-informacijski-sustav-prostornoga-uredjenja-ispu-i-njegovi-moduli-k-k-02-2-1-01-0020/10523">Spatial Planning Information System (ISPU) and its modules</a>’.

The latter enables cross-border electronic identification when using public services in the EU. This provides a tool for the recognition of electronic identities of Croatian citizens to access online cross-border public services in the EU. In this way, all the prerequisites for Croatian citizens to log in to public eServices in other Member States using the eOI are fulfilled. At the same time, some EU citizens (from countries which have completed the notification process) can access the eServices of the Croatian administration.</p><p>By 31 December 2022, the Republic of Croatia was fully connected with 22 Member States and had test-connected with three additional Member States. Depending on the status of the notifications of the above-mentioned countries, the mutual use of eServices by their and Croatian citizens will be initiated. Of course, it is up to each Member State to prepare its eServices for cross-border use.<a id="_Toc1474998"></a></p><h2>Base Registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Metaregister</p><p>The <a href="https://metaregistar.gov.hr/metareg/html/">Metaregister</a> is a public register which is part of the Central Interoperability System (SII) and serves to provide the information needed to connect and manage public registers. It was established in March 2015 and is published on the <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/metaregistar/1631">website</a> of the CSODDS. It contains detailed information on public registers and the data they hold, and communicates this to users through a single point. In this way, it provides an overview of the structured public registers, the type of data that is collected and hosted, as well as how to connect with other systems. </p><p>The Metaregister is a prerequisite for a country aiming for a paperless administration and the implementation of the Once-Only principle. A paperless State creates a single administrative location with connected registration systems to ensure the availability of data. This relieves the administrative burden on citizens, who do not have to transfer documents between different institutions themselves.</p><p>At the beginning of 2021, the development of the Technical Specification for the new Metaregister platform began. The basic functionalities were taken from the existing versions of the Metaregister, and new functionalities were released to the test environment in April 2021. The new Metaregister platform aims to become a key component of the future Central Interoperability Portal.</p><p class="subtitle">Shared Services Centre</p><p>According to the applicable decree, the SSC is an organisational business model for providing shared services to public sector bodies and other users, consisting of a normative framework and a governance structure in accordance with the regulation and the acts adopted pursuant to the decree. The SSC provides common business solutions and common ICT services, and its establishment, extension, maintenance and management is within the competence of the central State administration body responsible for eCroatia affairs.</p><p>The SSC aims to increase the use of ICT in communication between citizens and public administration through the establishment of an ICT coordination and software solution. The expected outcome is to increase the use of eGovernment services by citizens, which is assessed in terms of the frequency of use of eGovernment services by individuals, and to increase the number of residents communicating with public institutions. Specific results to be achieved include the functioning of the State cloud and the strengthening of the use of eServices in specific sectors defined in the digital strategy, i.e. the increase in the percentage of public institutions integrated in the cloud and the number of complex eServices provided to users.</p><p class="subtitle">Cadastral and Land Register Data Browser</p><p>The <a href="https://oss.uredjenazemlja.hr">Cadastral and Land Register Data Browser</a> provides insight into the central cadastral and land register database of Croatia, which incorporates all cadastral and land register offices. </p><p>The Croatian system of registering real properties and associated titles has several objectives. The most important include the introduction of security in real property legal transactions and the protection of titles registered in the registers. The system is based on two registers, namely the Cadastral Register and the Land Register.</p><p>The Cadastral Register includes records containing data on land parcels and buildings permanently present on the land or beneath its surface, as well as the special legal status on the land surface. The cadastral records are kept by the State Geodetic Administration regional cadastral offices and the Zagreb City Office for Cadastre and Geodetic Works.</p><p>Land Registers are public registers where data on legal real property status of merit for legal transactions are recorded. Each Land Register consists of the main register and a collection of deeds. Land Registers are kept by the Land Register Offices of municipal courts.</p><p>Through the Ministry of Justice and the State Geodetic Administration, the Croatian government initiated in 2003 the Real Property Registration and Cadastre National Programme, abbreviated as ‘Organized Land’, under which the JIS OSS was developed. The establishment of the system has led to the creation of a unified register for the cadastral and land registers in which the systems are interlinked and exchange real property data. In simplified terms, a unified database and application bringing numerous benefits to the users have been established to keep and maintain the cadastral and land register data. Apart from the time needed to access the data and make a registration being significantly reduced, citizens are today able to see at one place the ownership structure of a real property and its location in space, as well as to use numerous other functionalities.</p><p class="subtitle">eCourt Register</p><p>The <a href="https://sudreg.pravosudje.hr/registar/f?p=150:1">eCourt Register</a> contains all existing entities, including trading companies, co-ops and institutions.

The data exchanged gives a clear indication of changes in the life events and status of Croatia’s citizens. This information is then shared (upon request or by submitting a notification) with other relevant registers, such as the Pension Register or the Tax Administration Register. All relevant government bodies involved in the implementation of the OIB/PIN project update their information systems whenever necessary to include processes related to the OIB/PIN.
