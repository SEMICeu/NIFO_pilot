The main area of improvements concerns interoperability governance. Particularly, in order to improve its performance in this layer Greece should use a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assessing and selecting standards and specifications (Recommendation 22); further consult relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level, in accordance with your NIF and relevant DIFs, when procuring and developing ICT solutions (Recommendation 23); and improve the way it actively participates in standardisation work relevant to the country’s needs to ensure that requirements are met (Recommendation 24).</p><p><img src="img/35-422.x-emf" alt="35-422.x-emf" /></p><p>	Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a>	</p><p>Greece’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of all recommendations aligned with the EU average, except open registries.

The first beta version was publicly launched in March 2020 with more than 500 already developed digital services gathered in one single point of contact. </p><p>The responsibility for the operation, coordination and development of gov.gr lies with the Single Digital Gateway Coordination Service, which was established by Law No. 4704/2020 (Article 16). It is structured in two departments, the Single Digital Portal Operations Office and the Single Digital Portal Design and Development Office. Currently, it employs ten people (developers, data analysts, policy analysts and other specialties).The mission of this new unit is to continuously upgrade the quality of digital services, as well as to ensure the trust of citizens on how their transactions with the public administration are managed. In this regard, the new unit is responsible for:</p><ul><li><strong>Design of Digital Public Services</strong>. The operational and technical design of new digital services, as well as the monitoring of their implementation, in cooperation with the competent services of public authorities.</li><li><strong>Digital Public Service Management</strong>. The provision of services through gov.gr that ensures the alignment of services designed and implemented by third-party public sector entities to achieve the best possible results for users and the public administration.</li><li><strong>Strategic Planning and Operational Architecture</strong>. The overall architecture of the gov.gr technology ecosystem that interconnects information systems and registries, guiding the horizontal architectural approaches to authentication, data protection and data reuse.</li><li><strong>Data and Business Analytics for gov.gr</strong>.

The aim is to monitor user activity to enhance user research and experience methods, thus being able to make well-documented changes and improvements.</li><li><strong>Citizen feedback and support</strong>. Emphasis on different groups of individuals (people with disabilities, elderly, mobile phone users) and support for single users who have issues using the services provided by gov.gr.</li><li><strong>Change in organisational culture</strong>. For any technological reform to be successful, a cultural change is needed to promote innovation and creativity in the ecosystem of public organizations. In this context, the service will organize thematic events on digital service design, support public bodies to redesign their services and engage both expert and end-user views through co-creation, feedback and user research processes. Harmonization of service design will ensure a high-quality user experience.</li></ul><p class="subtitle"><a href="https://nationaldigitalacademy.gov.gr/">National Digital Academy</a></p><p>In 2020, the Hellenic Ministry of Digital Governance launched an important project towards the improvement of the digital literacy level of all citizens, regardless of their qualification, age, gender, educational level, work, and social background, thus preventing economic and social exclusion through the creation of the <a href="http://www.nationaldigitalacademy.gov.gr/">National Digital Academy</a>. The basic aim of the academy is to link the policies of the Hellenic Ministry of Digital Governance with the corresponding development of citizens digital skills by offering a plethora of educational opportunities through an electronic platform, which will be the central coordination point for all activities and digital education providers towards the digital transformation of the country. </p><p>At the Digital Academy, citizens can choose the courses that suit their needs, interests and level of knowledge and skills, free of charge and without complicated registration procedures. The portal of the Digital Academy also features a self-evaluation tool that follows the European evaluation standard DigiComp v2.1, to enable citizens to assess their own digital skills. Then, and according to the result of the self-assessment, citizens are provided with an individualised course proposal. Specialised users or ICT professionals may choose and attend a significant number of courses. 214 courses are offered free of charge by 32 certified and distinguished providers through the portal of the Digital Academy, which are further divided into 30 thematic units and correspond to a total of 1 800 hours of training.</p><p class="subtitle"><a href="https://howto.gov.gr/">Digital Services Training Portal</a></p><p>The <a href="http://howto.gov.gr/">Digital Services Training Portal</a> provides instructions for use in selected digital services of the Single Digital Portal gov.gr. The aim of the training portal is to provide citizens with easy, fast, and affordable practical support for the use of public administration digital services. The portal provides the following courses:</p><ul><li>Learn about vaccination!;</li><li>Intangible prescription;</li><li>Authorisation;</li><li>Affirmation;</li><li>Process author;</li><li>What is gov.gr?; and</li><li>Enrolment in kindergarten.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Hellenic Open Data Portal</p><p>The Hellenic Open Data Portal (<a href="http://www.data.gov.gr">data.gov.gr</a>) is the national portal for the dissemination of open data. It is the central directory of the public administration that provides free access to the databases of Greek government agencies. Thirty-nine agencies have been integrated into the open data portal, providing the data for free through an integrated Application Programming Interface (API). The purpose of the Hellenic Open Data Portal is to increase the web accessibility of Greek public administration datasets by providing integrated services, e.g. cataloguing, indexing, storage, search and availability of public sector data and information, as well as online services to citizens and third-party information systems. The implementation of a new version of the portal is in progress to improve the technical features and functions of the data repository but also to provide a quality upgrade to the information. Special emphasis is placed on the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) both in terms of availability and reception of datasets.</p><p class="subtitle">Register of Bodies granted by the Public Sector</p><p>The <a href="https://ppp.eaadhsy.gr/index.php/el/?option=com_sppagebuilder&amp;view=page&amp;id=7">Register of Bodies granted by the Public Sector</a> contains information concerning the expenses of non-profit entities that receive funding from General Government Entities (amounting to EUR 3 000 or more per year).</p><p class="subtitle">Diavgeia – Transparency Portal</p><p><a href="https://diavgeia.gov.gr/">Diavgeia</a> is one of the major transparency initiatives of the Ministry of Digital Governance. Since its inception in 2010, decisions by public entities cannot be implemented unless they are uploaded on the <a href="https://diavgeia.gov.gr/en">Diavgeia Transparency Portal</a> and each document is digitally signed and assigned an automatic and unique transaction number. Diavgeia covers all public institutions, regulatory authorities, and local governments. For the first time in Greece, the Diavgeia Programme introduced the obligation to publish all government decisions on the internet, except for those containing sensitive personal data and/or national security information.</p><p>Within the framework of the principle of open action of the administration, the enhancement of transparency and accountability is sought by extending the scope of the Transparency Programme by further obliging to post the expenses accounts of non-profit organisations that are subsidised by the General Government with an amount of more than EUR 3 000 euro in total per year at the Register of Bodies granted by the Public Sector (failing to publish the above statements leads to exclusion from any kind of further grant or financing). </p><p class="subtitle">emvolio.gov.gr</p><p>The SARS-COV-2 virus poses a major threat to public health as it causes significant morbidity and mortality in certain groups of the population. Its danger is intensified by its easy transmission and continued dispersal, despite the multilevel interventions and extensive restraint measures that have been taken. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented health, social and economic crisis worldwide. It has influenced and continues to influence public and private structures, dramatically changing people's lives. The <a href="https://emvolio.gov.gr/">emvolio.gov.gr</a> portal was developed in the framework of the National Operational Plan of Vaccinations against COVID-19 in order to quickly ensure the immune protection of citizens against the threat of infection. The portal includes a citizen information website, an online application to schedule appointments, and a website with statistical data from data.gov.gr. </p><p>In parallel with the portal, the following applications were developed:</p><ul><li>Online application of the support office;</li><li>Online and mobile application of vaccination centres;</li><li>Online application for the vaccine supply and distribution programme; and</li><li>Programme management and monitoring application. </li></ul><p>To support the portal and the applications, the appropriate computing resources and services infrastructure were developed in the Amazon AWS Cloud Computing platform.</p><p class="subtitle">ehealth.gov.gr</p><p>Through the <a href="http://www.ehealth.gov.gr">ehealth.gov.gr</a> portal, the process of digital prescription is applied at national level. With the digital prescription, citizens can receive prescriptions on their mobile phone and/or by email, without having to submit them in hard copy to the pharmacist. In this way, the daily life of the citizens is improved, especially of the chronically ill, as they can receive prescriptions remotely. In addition, doctors are relieved of time-consuming formal procedures, allowing them to focus on cases that need their immediate attention.</p><p class="subtitle">ATLAS - atlas.gov.gr</p><p>The <a href="https://www.atlas.gov.gr/ATLAS/Pages/Home.aspx">ATLAS System</a> is the modern integrated social security system that brings together the insurance history of all insured citizens in the country.
