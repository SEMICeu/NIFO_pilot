The strategy focused on building an economy that works for everyone and making sure that wealth and opportunity are spread across the country. It means building a nation that stands tall in the world and is set up to succeed in the long term. </p><p>As suggested by the name, this digital strategy is for the whole of the UK and is comprised of seven strands:</p><ul><li><strong>Connectivity</strong> - Building world-class digital infrastructure for the UK;</li><li><strong>Digital skills and inclusion</strong> - Giving everyone access to the digital skills they need;</li><li><strong>The digital sectors</strong> - Making the UK the best place to start and grow a digital business;</li><li><strong>The wider economy</strong> - Helping every British business become a digital business;</li><li><strong>A safe and secure cyberspace</strong> - Making the UK the safest place in the world to live and work online;</li><li><strong>Digital Government</strong> - Maintaining the UK Government as a world leader in serving its citizens online;</li><li><strong>Data</strong> - Unlocking the power of data in the UK economy and improving public confidence in its use.</li></ul><p>The strategy is a framework developed in partnership with industry to deliver successful sectorial policies. This digital strategy is therefore a first statement in an ongoing conversation between digital businesses and government: as the UK Government develops its industrial and digital strategies, they will continue to build on that conversation and to strengthen their support. To facilitate this, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will convene a forum for government and the tech community to work together to support the growth of the UK digital economy.</p><p>The strategy for delivery of the Digital Strategy is via the following pillars:</p><ul><li>Science, research and innovation, where they must become a more innovative economy, and do more to commercialise our world leading science base to deliver growth across the UK;</li><li>Skills, where they must help people and businesses to thrive by ensuring everyone has the basic skills needed in a modern economy; by building a new system of Technical Education to benefit the half the population who do not go to university, boosting STEM skills and numeracy, and raising skill levels in lagging areas;</li><li>Infrastructure, where they must upgrade our performance on digital, energy, and transport infrastructure, and must better align central government infrastructure investment with local growth priorities;</li><li>Supporting businesses to start and grow, where they must ensure that businesses across the UK can access the finance and management skills they need to grow; and create the conditions to enable firms to invest for the long term;</li><li>Procurement policy, where strategic government procurement can drive innovation and enable the development of UK supply chains;</li><li>Trade and inward investment policy, where government policy can help boost productivity and growth across our economy including by increasing competition and helping to bring new ways of doing things to the UK;</li><li>Affordable energy and clean growth, where they need to ensure that they both keep costs down for businesses, and secure the economic benefits of the transition to a low carbon economy;</li><li>Sectoral policies, where they must both build on our areas of competitive advantage, and help new sectors to flourish, in many cases challenging existing institutions and incumbents;</li><li>Spreading growth across the country, whether it is investing in key infrastructure projects to unlock growth, increasing skill levels, or backing local innovation strengths, the Industrial Strategy will create a framework to build on the particular strengths of different places and address factors that hold them back;</li><li>Creating the right institutional framework, in some places and sectors there may be missing institutions which they could create, or existing ones they could strengthen: be they local educational institutions, trade associations or financial networks.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Digital Charter</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-charter-will-set-new-online-standards-for-years-to-come">Government’s Digital Charter</a> was published on 25 January 2018.

The consultation covers various aspects of online safety including:</p><ul><li>The introduction of a social media code of practice, transparency reporting and a social media levy;</li><li>Technological solutions to online harms;</li><li>Developing children’s digital literacy;</li><li>Support for parents and carers;</li><li>Adults’ experience of online abuse;</li><li>Young people’s use of online dating websites/applications.</li></ul><h3>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle">Government Digital Inclusion Strategy (December 2014)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/government-digital-inclusion-strategy">Government Digital Inclusion Strategy</a> set out how government and partners from the public, private and voluntary sectors work together to increase digital inclusion. This means helping people to become capable of using and benefiting from the internet. </p><p>In November 2015, the team responsible for this strategy moved to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) from the Cabinet Office’s Government Digital Service, as part of a Machinery of Government change. The team now sits within the Digital Economy Unit. Following the team’s move, the focus has slightly shifted from Digital Inclusion to Digital Engagement. This reflects a reframing of the policy as primarily a motivational engagement issue. </p><p>The Digital Engagement Team has been working to develop new delivery priorities and work areas. The Council will replace the current governance structure of the Sub-Group (to represent government departments) and Delivery Board (to represent non-government organisations), combining members from public, private and voluntary sectors and chaired by the Minister for Culture and Digital Economy. The Council will oversee a number of tasks and groups that will tackle various key issues for digital engagement. Areas for focus are still under development but might involve targeted work with particular customer groups or wider work to support and encourage people to engage digitally. </p><p>The 2014 actions in the Digital Inclusion strategy were about addressing the barriers that have stopped people going online until now and backing initiatives that will make things better. Key progress to date is listed below:</p><ul><li>An Exemplar Services and Identity Assurance<em> </em>policy paper has been developed by the Government Digital Service. This looks to gauge the level of difficulty of a selection of online tasks that would require digital skills to complete.</li><li>The UK Government through BEIS has been involved in providing support for basic digital skills since 2010, with some GBP 36 million provided to help over 1.5 million individuals gain the basic digital skills needed to allow them to access employment and education opportunities and the wider benefits of being digital.</li><li>Civil Service Learning (CSL) has worked to improve the digital capabilities of civil servants: implemented online digital learning resources free on CSL website, publicised the Digital Friends initiative via the CSL website, and looked to set up a task and finish group with cross civil service representation to populate a renewed digital curriculum.</li><li>Departments have worked hard to ensure their staff have the correct digital capabilities. Across government departments, digital weeks/fortnights have been introduced, along with digital ambassadors and Digital Friends initiatives. </li><li>To date, 91 organisations have signed up to the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM8syp2e_SAhXpBZoKHVA9D04QFggjMAA&amp;url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-digital-inclusion-strategy/uk-digital-inclusion-charter&amp;usg=AFQjCNH3oTjLqeg11Af-QfJKB6Cy8P_fiQ">Digital Inclusion Charter</a> and collaborate with government to deliver the Digital Inclusion Strategy. The Digital Inclusion team has worked with these stakeholders to develop products such as the cross-sector Digital Inclusion Outcomes Framework and initiatives like Digital Friends which promotes informal sharing of basic digital skills. The Digital Engagement team has a coordination role in facilitating multi-sector partnerships. The programme of work is continuously evolving. Departments have been partnering with various organisations to deliver outcomes. DWP, for example, has worked with Barclays Digital Eagles and EE Techy Tea Parties. With government coordination, BT and Barclays have partnered to provide free Wi-Fi to over 70 libraries and community centres. </li><li>Departments have been partnering with various organisations to deliver outcomes. DWP, for example, has worked with Barclays Digital Eagles and EE Techy Tea Parties. Outside government, BT and Barclays have partnered to provide free Wi-Fi to libraries and community centres. </li><li>The definition of ‘basic online skills’ used for 2014 data (the ability to: send and receive emails, use a search engine, browse the internet, and fill out an online application form) has now been revised, re-termed ‘basic <em>digital</em> skills’ and an updated set of measures has been developed. This broader definition of basic digital skills includes five tasks: managing information, communicating, transacting, problem-solving and creating. </li><li>Work has been completed by departments to support SMEs in developing digital skills and knowledge. The ‘Small Business Digital Capability Programme’ was established to help increase digital skills amongst businesses by supporting them to take action and do more online. BEIS published an evidence review of digital support available - ‘Digital Capabilities in SMEs’ - to provide information on types of businesses who are and are not using technologies and the reasons why; the level of eCommerce among SMEs and plans for engaging with digital technology in the future.</li><li>Government is committed to supporting voluntary and community groups to address their organisational needs. For example, it is currently running a GBP 20 million fund to support small to medium sized charities to deliver change and secure and enhance their services. Applicants have been supported to lead the development of change plans and that haven't specified area of focus. However, many organisations are expected to focus on addressing capability needs such as digital.</li><li>Government is also working to increase cross sector volunteering, by encouraging more businesses to allow their staff to volunteer. This will allow charities to access a wide range of professional skills to build their capabilities. Digital is an area that has significant potential, with a number of excellent cross sector partnerships already underway.</li><li>A ‘Digital Inclusion Outcomes Framework’ has been developed by the Digital Inclusion Research Working Group. It is a single, flexible template for benchmarking and tracking digital inclusion in the UK and evaluating digital inclusion activities locally. It aims to evidence the wider economic, health and social benefits of digital inclusion.</li></ul><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">The Digital Service Standard and Technology Code of Practice</p><p>The Digital <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard">Service Standard</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/technology-code-of-practice/technology-code-of-practice">Technology Code of Practice</a> are the UK Government's standards for creating and running digital services. Both documents align with the recommendations and principles of the European Interoperability Framework.<br />Specifically, both documents include points on the use of open standards to improve interoperability of services and technology components. The Technology Code of Practice and the Service Manual include detailed guidance on using open standards.<br />The GDS Open Standards Board follows the CAMMS process and the Open Standards Board assesses standards. They are then mandated for use. As part of the spend controls process they insist that all new technology has to comply with mandatory open standards.  All open data must also be published in open formats.  The country has joined a number of open standards bodies and development organisations to enable better understanding of how they can promote standards. They regularly present workshops and write blog posts encouraging standards. The Open Standards Board has also selected 14 mandatory open standards for use in government technology.</p><p>The Technology Code of Practice and the Digital Service Standard state that understanding user needs is a core requirement of building and running any government digital service.</p><p>They state that open standards should be used to increase compatibility with all stakeholders and give users a more consistent experience when using government services online. They also state that using open standards will help service providers becoming locked in to a specific piece of technology or supplier.</p><p>The Government Digital Service assures that open standards are used wherever possible through service assessments and the spend controls process.</p><p>The Service Standard requires all services to thoroughly “evaluate tools and systems”. Service teams are asked to assess and choose the appropriate technology to meet user and organisation needs. This is assessed in a formal service assessment at alpha, beta and before going live. For example, for a live assessment, service teams will be asked to:</p><ul><li>describe the tech stack changes they made during beta and why </li><li>describe the development toolchain changes they made during beta and why </li><li>explain how they’re continuing to get value for money from the systems they chose and bought at beta </li><li>explain or demonstrate how they’ll check if the service is healthy </li><li>explain the support arrangements that they’ve set up for live </li><li>explain any decisions they’ve outsourced and why they chose to do this</li></ul><p>All government documents should be published in an open format (ODF or HTML5) to ensure that proprietary software is not needed to interact with government. All websites must be tested in 11 popular web browsers.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Artificial Intelligence review</p><p>In 2017, the United Kingdom began conducting a new <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/review-of-artificial-intelligence-in-transport-2017">Artificial Intelligence (AI) review</a> led by GDS, in partnership with the Office of Artificial Intelligence, to look at how government could use artificial intelligence, automation and data in new ways to drive public sector productivity and produce economic benefits.

It provided clear statutory rights for any member of the public to apply for access to information held by bodies across the public sector, together with a strong enforcement regime. A new Information Commissioner's Office and an Information Tribunal, with wide powers to enforce the rights created, were established by the Act, along with a duty imposed on public authorities to adopt a scheme for the publication of information.

The Act states that births and deaths shall be registered in the registry of the sub-district in which the event occurred. Furthermore, the legislation explicitly states which persons are qualified to register the birth or death of the person concerned. Additionally, the Act sets out the maximum length of time within which the life event must be officially registered.

It became necessary to incorporate this idea into the initial phase of designing the registry. As a part of Government Digital Services (GDS), the Registry Design Authority is charged with guaranteeing that registries accurately reflect the interconnectedness of government data. In doing so, the Authority has to determine which registries get built, which implies also definition of where the new registry will be placed within the linked ecosystem of registries, establishing whether the registry data constitutes a ‘minimum viable dataset’ and ensuring that data kept is accurate and up-to-date so that it is considered good enough to build services, as well as determining which part of government is best placed to run the new registry.</p><p class="subtitle">Registry of Registries</p><p>Another important item introduced by the UK is the <a href="https://register.register.gov.uk/">Registry of Registries</a>.

The Land Registry in the UK registries ownership of property and as such is one of the largest property databases in Europe. It has 14 offices, with its head office in Croydon. It is self-sufficient regarding funding, as it receives no government funding, but rather finances its operations from registration and search fees.

The authority in charge of maintaining and updating the guidelines called the <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/03/11/getting-from-data-to-registers/">Registries Design Authority</a> which is part of the Government Digital Services (GDS). The approach to modelling data in a new registry consists of naming conventions for registries and fields, appropriate data type usage, support for linking registries, privacy protection, extensibility and finally semantics and metadata. In the case of the UK, the main vocabulary used for listing datasets in the open data port, data.gov.uk, is DCAT.</p><p>Furthermore, in the UK registries are clearly defined as being open, closed, shared and private, and it is the nature of the registries which defines what services are appropriate for it. An example of a service designed to exchange personal data is the <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/tell-us-once">Tell Us Once service</a>, which allows the reporting of birth or death to be carried out once, yet is automatically distributed to the appropriate government organisations. The personal data entered for the purpose of the service is held for a maximum of 35 days, after which it is deleted to protect the person’s data. Additional resources have also been created by <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/">Government Digital Service</a> (GDS), which have as their objective the facilitation of building registries and services such as the ones mentioned above. </p><h1><a id="_Toc11945558"></a>Digital Government Services for Citizens</h1><p><a id="_Toc1475000"></a>The information in this section presents an overview of the basic public services provided to the citizens.
