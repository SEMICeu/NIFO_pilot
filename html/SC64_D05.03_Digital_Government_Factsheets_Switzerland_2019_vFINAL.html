There are: Identification (eID), Electronic documents (eDocuments), Authoritative Sources, and Digital Post. Digital Post refers to the possibility that governments communicate electronically-only with citizens or entrepreneurs through e.g. personal mailboxes or other digital mail solutions.</p><p>These top-level benchmarks are measured using a life-events (e.g. mystery shopping) approach. Eight life events are included in the overall eGovernment performance score.

The Unit was responsible for the implementation of the strategy. The key purpose of the strategy was to demonstrate how ICTs should be used to assist the Federal Administration’s functions. A binding action framework was defined comprising responsible authorities, strategic directions and objectives. The ultimate aim was that the ICT Strategy acted as the implementing instrument of the eGovernment strategy at federal level. The <a href="https://www.bakom.admin.ch/bakom/en/homepage.html">Federal Office of Communications (OFCOM)</a> played a crucial role in the development of the national ICT policies, namely the Federal Council's <a href="https://www.isb.admin.ch/isb/en/home/themen/strategie_planung/ikt-strategie_bund_2016-2019.html">Federal ICT Strategy 2016-2019</a> created prosperity in Switzerland, guaranteed sustainability and improves the country's attractiveness as a business location.</p><p>The previous programme ran from 2007 until 2011.

Today in Switzerland, the data exchange platform sedex offers organizations such as public authorities, health insurance companies etc. the ability to transfer data securely.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>ID Cards</p><p>Until further notice, the <a href="https://www.ch.ch/en/passport-id-card/">Swiss ID card</a> will continue to be issued in the form of a plastic photo-card without a chip or electronically stored data.</p><p class="subtitle">SuisseID, SwissID, Mobile ID and E-ID</p><p><a href="https://www.postsuisseid.ch/fr/">SuisseID</a> enables people to identify themselves uniquely online and to add a valid electronic signature to contracts. It is a digital passport and electronic signature all in one.</p><p>The SuisseID comprises the following three elements:</p><p><strong>Electronic proof of identity</strong></p><p>Facilitates participation to all electronic services requiring a secure identification of users/customers.</p><p><strong>Qualified electronic signature</strong></p><p>Facilitates the electronic signing of documents. Digital signatures cannot be counterfeited, and, by law, they are equivalent to traditional signatures.</p><p><strong>Transparency regarding business-relevant personal attributes</strong></p><p>Persons listed in professional (or other) registers and directories are able to substantiate unequivocally the correctness of these personal attributes to third parties.</p><p>A new generation of digital identity – <a href="https://www.swissid.ch/en/private-users">SwissID</a> – has been available since spring 2017. This new SwissID did not replace the SuisseID which remained available as a product. Nothing changed for SuisseID users; they could still continue using their old ID as before. Both services complemented each other’s functionality; in the medium term, however, SuisseID will be incorporated into SwissID.</p><p>In Switzerland, other forms of electronic identity are also available:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.mobileid.ch/en">Mobile ID</a> is a joint solution of various Swiss mobile service providers and serves two-factor authentication. It is used as a login or as an authorisation method. For example, to release a transfer from one bank account to another. In the form of a text message, a request is sent to the mobile phone and confirmed by entering the Mobile ID PIN.</li><li>A state-approved digital identity (<a href="https://www.egovernment.ch/en/umsetzung/schwerpunktplan/elektronische-identitat/">E-ID</a>) the introduction of which was approved by the National Council on 20 March 2018. The federal government is responsible for the identification of a person. The E-ID is valid nationally and internationally and is issued by private providers, the so-called Identity Providers (IdP).</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)</p><p>On 1 January 2005, the legal regulations on the electronic signature (ZertES, VzertED and the corresponding amendments) entered into force. This meant that the ZertES-compliant electronic signature was legally equivalent to a handwritten signature, anchoring in law the accountability of the owner of the signing key. Recognition of the respective certification service provider resided with a certification service that met the requirements of the law. The <a href="https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home.html">Federal Office of IT, Systems and Telecommunications (FOITT)</a> provided its <a href="https://www.adnovum.ch/en/case_studies/finance/pf-pki.html">admin PKI</a> solution, a security service basis for the Confederation and cantons.

It aims to use this information towards the improvement of the environment and includes data from administrative units, transport networks, protected sites, elevation, population distribution, energy resources, utility and government services, natural risks zones etc. INSPIRE was founded on interoperability basics. Member countries have agreed on common standards to describe and share spatial data between public authorities. In Switzerland, the Federal office of Topography is responsible for managing Swiss spatial data. Through its platform geocat.ch, 86% of data is available to the public. Furthermore <a href="https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/swisstopo/vision.html">Strategy Focus for 2020</a> clearly describes the office´s ambitions towards creating a transparent and open government. Despite the fact that the Swiss government has no legal obligation to participate, it aims to implement semantic and technical compatibility procedures in order to adhere to international requirements by using INSPIRE as its geo-data index.</p><p>Switzerland´s parliament agreed to improve EU criminal record checking.
