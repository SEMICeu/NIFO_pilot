The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below. </p><p><img src="img/35-170.png" alt="35-170.png" /> </p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021 </a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise within the 27 Member States in 2021.</p><p><img src="img/35-202.png" alt="35-202.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF principles for the 27 Member States with multiple principles scoring at 4. Areas of improvement are concentrated in the Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility), 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency), for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of the corresponding recommendations.</p><p>Principle 1 requires European countries’ decision-making processes to follow the objectives of <strong>subsidiarity and proportionality. </strong>This principle is assessed through Recommendation 1, which states that European countries should “ensure that national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies are aligned with the EIF and, if needed, tailor and extend them to address the national context and needs”. The result of 3 for Recommendation 1 and consequently for Principle 1, at European level, shows a partial implementation of EIF recommendations in existing or ongoing NIFs and policies. The analysis of the results revealed that the number of countries reporting a high level of alignment of their NIFs and strategies with the EIF decreased from 16 in 2020 to 13 in 2021.</p><p>Principle 7 calls for <strong>inclusion and accessibility </strong>throughout the development cycle of a European public service in terms of design, information, content and delivery. This principle should be taken into account in order to ensure that all citizens have access to European public services and that they can take full advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies to access and use these services. This principle is assessed through Recommendation 14 assessing the countries’ compliance with the European accessibility standards of the Directive (EU) 2016/2102 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies. When analysing the overall European countries’ performance in implementing Recommendation 14, the results revealed a partial implementation of the accessibility standards set forth by the Directive (EU) 2016/2102 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public- sector bodies.</p><p>Principle 9 promotes <strong>multilingualism </strong>when designing European public services to make them accessible and usable by anyone that may need them, therefore the underlying Recommendation 16 calls for European countries to “use information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service and decide on the level of multilingualism support based on the needs of the expected users”. The implementation score for this recommendation is computed by assessing the extent to which users of each of the 21 proposed procedures across the 7 life events (i.e. Birth, Residence, Studying, etc.) of the Single Digital Gateway Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2018/1724) can access instructions for completing the procedure in an official EU language that is widely understood by the largest possible number of cross-border users. The results of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism with regard to multilingualism showed a heterogeneous implementation of the principle. For instance, the possibility of accessing instructions for completing the procedures in an official EU language is not always ensured in the European countries, especially for procedures related to moving.</p><p>Principle 12 assesses the extent to which nine key elements, i.e. return on investments, total cost of ownership, reusability, adaptability, risks, administrative burden, simplification of administrative processes, user satisfaction and user-centricity, are taken into account in the evaluation of the <strong>effectiveness and efficiency </strong>of a European public service. The principle is evaluated through Recommendation 19 which states that European public administrations should “evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits”. Overall, the results at the European level for Recommendation 19, and thus for Principle 12, indicated a partial implementation with an average score of three. In particular, the results showed that return on investment and adaptability are the least considered when assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of public services, while simplification of administrative processes and reusability are more commonly taken into account across Europe.</p><p><img src="img/35-213.png" alt="35-213.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2, the 27 Member States show on average a very good performance in implementing all layers with the score of 4. However, potential areas of improvement to reinforce the European Union’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance to ensure a full implementation of all recommendations associated with this area.</p><p>The implementation of the <strong>interoperability governance </strong>layer is evaluated through recommendations 20 to 24, which address two aspects: the implementation of holistic governance for interoperability activities across administrative levels and sectors, the identification and selection of common standards and specifications to facilitate interoperability. With respect to the interoperability governance layer, there have been significant improvements mainly regarding the implementation of a holistic governance across all administrative levels and sectors, and the implementation of defined processes for the selection and adoption of standards and specifications. More specifically, almost all European countries now provide interoperability governance with a holistic approach across all administrative levels and sectors, with the exception of three countries that are still in the process of doing so.</p><p><img src="img/35-231.png" alt="35-231.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The average scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 of the 27 Member States show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model, internal and external information sources and services, base registries and open data. However, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to catalogues, external information sources and services as well as in the area of security and privacy.</p><p><strong>Catalogues </strong>are a key component of the conceptual model for integrated public services and aim at supporting the easy access to reusable resources (e.g. services, data, software). A variety of catalogues exist ranging from directories of services, to libraries of software components and metadata catalogues. The description of the content provided is equally important to the resources it contains as it enables interoperability in-between different catalogues. The implementation of interoperable catalogues is evaluated through Recommendation 44 of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism calling on European countries to “put in place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions and use common models for describing them”. The assessment of this recommendation takes into account nine main types of catalogues that European public bodies should have at their disposal to design integrated and interoperable public services, i.e. catalogues of public data, directories of services, libraries of software components, open data portals, registries of base registries, metadata catalogues, catalogues of standards, catalogues of specifications and catalogues of guidelines. The results, at European level, for this particular indicator outlined a partial implementation of these key catalogues within public administrations. Indeed, while open data portals and catalogues of public data are used in a vast majority of European countries, it appears that other types of catalogues, such as libraries of software components and catalogues of specifications and guidelines are yet to be implemented uniformly across Europe.</p><p>The EIF fosters the <strong>use of external information sources and services </strong>by European public administrations in the design of interoperable public services. Indeed, public administrations need to leverage services provided by third parties outside their organisational boundaries, such as payment services provided by financial institutions or connectivity services provided by telecommunications providers. They also need to tap into external information sources such as open data and data from international organizations, chambers of commerce, etc. The use of external information sources and services is assessed through Recommendation 45 calling on European public administrations to “use external information sources and services while developing European public services, where useful and feasible to do so” measured by the extent to which public administrations are using external information sources and services while developing public services. The 2021 results of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism revealed that European countries insufficiently rely on external sources and services for the development of their public services. On the one hand, it appears that the use of Internet of Things sources (e.g. sensors) and social web applications is quite low across Europe. On the other hand, the use of payment services provided by financial institutions or other actors, connectivity services provided by telecommunications providers, open data, data from other organisations (e.g. international organisations, chambers of commerce, etc...), eID and eSignature are much more widespread among European public administrations.</p><p>The principle of <strong>security and privacy </strong>is a crucial element to embed by design in the development of interoperable public services. Public services should follow the privacy- by-design and security-by-design approach to secure their complete infrastructure and should be compliant with the legal requirements regarding data protection and privacy. The EIF therefore calls on European countries to “consider the specific security and privacy requirements and identify measures for the provision of each public service according to risk management plans” (Recommendation 46) and “use trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services” (Recommendation 47). The implementation of this recommendation is assessed through the application of privacy and security elements and measures (e.g. risk management and business continuity plans and eArchive) and the number of trust services providers by country. The score for security and privacy at the European level, showed an overall good implementation of Recommendation 46 within national frameworks, with an increase in the implementation of all privacy and security elements and measures, but with the exception of risk management. However, the scores for Recommendation 47 are heterogeneous, as the number of trust service providers present on national trusted lists complying with the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">eIDAS Regulation</a> varies across countries and remains insufficient in some of them.</p><p>An in-depth analysis of the European results in the 2021 edition of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available within second chapter of the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/news/state-play-report-2021-now-live">State of Play report on digital public</a> <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/news/state-play-report-2021-now-live">administration and interoperability in Europe</a>.

More specifically, the Declaration has at its core key rights and principles for the digital transformation, such as placing people and their rights at its centre, supporting solidarity and inclusion, ensuring the freedom of choice online, fostering participation in the digital public space, increasing safety, security and empowerment of individuals, and promoting the sustainability of the digital future. </p><p class="subtitle">The Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-based Digital Government</p><p>The <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-based Digital Government </a>of 2020, henceforth referred to as Berlin Declaration, was preceded by the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/ministerial-declaration-egovernment-tallinn-declaration">Tallinn Declaration</a>. The Berlin Declaration reaffirms and acknowledges the importance of the public sector in the European Single Market, taking the service-oriented and citizen-centric principles formulated in the Tallinn Declaration a step forward.</p><p>The Berlin Declaration reiterates the common political commitment of the Commission and the Member States to continue investing in high quality, user-centric and seamless cross-border digital public services. By signing the document, the Member States pledged to adopt the following 7 principles:</p><ul><li>Validity and respect of fundamental rights and democratic values in the digital sphere;</li><li>Social participation and digital inclusion to shape the digital world;</li><li>Empowerment and digital literacy, allowing all citizens to participate in the digital  sphere;</li><li>Trust and security in digital government interactions, allowing everyone to navigate the digital world safely, authenticate and be digitally recognised within the EU conveniently;</li><li>Digital sovereignty and interoperability, as a key in ensuring the ability of citizens and public administrations to make decisions and act self-determined in the digital world;</li><li>Human-centred systems and innovative technologies in the public sector, strengthening its pioneering role in the research on secure and trustworthy technology design;</li><li>A resilient and sustainable digital society, preserving our natural foundations of life in line with the Green Deal and using digital technologies to enhance the sustainability of our health systems.</li></ul><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">Interoperability Action Plan supporting the implementation of the revised European Interoperability Framework</p><p>The revised European Interoperability Framework (EIF), maintained under the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/isa2_en">ISA² programme</a>, was adopted on 23 March 2017. The framework provided specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services. It offers public administrations a set of 47 concrete recommendations on how to improve governance of their interoperability activities, establish cross-organisational relationships, streamline processes supporting end-to-end digital services, and ensure that both existing and new legislation do not compromise interoperability efforts. </p><p>In October 2021, a <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/29d694d4-4696-11ec-89db-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-244162647">Study supporting the evaluation of the implementation of the EIF</a> was written by CEPS and published by the Commission with the purpose of assessing whether relevant recommendations should become part of a mandatory instrument. The Commission is currently working on the 2022 evaluation of the EIF, which has been conducted in consultation with relevant stakeholders and will be published soon. The Commission is also currently working on the Interoperable Europe Act, setting up a new governance framework to further foster digital policymaking and ensuring that the current EIF is aligned with the Member States’ needs and expectations. </p><p>The revised EIF is accompanied by the Interoperability Action Plan, outlining priorities to support the implementation of the EIF. The Action Plan consists of 22 actions, grouped into five focus areas:</p><ul><li>Ensuring governance, coordination and sharing of interoperability initiatives;</li><li>Developing interoperability solutions to foster collaboration between organisations;</li><li>Engaging stakeholders and raising awareness of interoperability;</li><li>Developing, maintaining and promoting key interoperability enablers;</li><li>Developing, improving and promoting supporting instruments for interoperability.</li></ul><p>As the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/isa2_en">ISA² programme</a> came to an end in December 2020, the European Commission evaluated it along with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/eif_en">European Interoperability Framework</a> and presented <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/interoperable-europe/interoperable-europe">Interoperable Europe</a>, a reinforced public sector interoperability strategy committed to transform the public administrations in Europe and help them in their digital transformation.  </p><p>An <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert-groups-register/screen/expert-groups/consult?lang=en&amp;groupID=3714">expert group on Interoperability of European Public Services </a>has also been formed whose goal is to identify and exchange food practices when implementing the EIF, to provide the Commission with opinions, analysis and reports on interoperability of public services, to identify and assess the legal, organisation, semantical and technical obstacles preventing the set-up of interoperable European public services, among others.</p><p>For regional and local interoperability, the proposal on the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/news/eif4scc-smart-cities-communities">European Interoperability</a> <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/news/eif4scc-smart-cities-communities">Framework for Smart Cities and Communities</a> (EIF4SCC) aims to support local administrations and policy makers in offering interoperability services to citizens and businesses by providing definitions, principles, recommendations, practical use cases and a common model that will enable public service delivery across domains, cities, regions and borders.</p><p>The EIF4SCC is managed by DG CONNECT under the framework of the <a href="https://living-in.eu/">Living-in.eu</a> movement.

The Single Digital Gateway will address the current fragmentation and information gaps by completing, improving and linking up relevant EU and national-level online information, assistance services and procedures in a user-friendly way.</p><p>The aim is to provide businesses and citizens with high quality, comprehensive information, effective assistance and problem-solving services and efficient compliance procedures regarding EU and national rules applicable to citizens and businesses when they want to do business and/or to travel to, buy from, work, study or reside in another Member State. The gateway will be based on a user interface that would search the best service package for any query a user may have.</p><p>The Single Digital Gateway Regulation introduces (Article 14) the once-only principle for cross-border transactions, meaning that citizens and businesses will not have to provide data more than once to public administrations in the EU. This principle will be applicable for all the procedures under <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2018.295.01.0001.01.ENG&amp;d1e32-36-1">Annex II</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a Framework for the Free Flow of Non-Personal Data in the European Union</p><p>In line with the objectives of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-building-european-data-economy">Communication on Building a European Data Economy</a>, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32018R1807">Regulation</a>, applicable as of 28 May 2019, aimed to achieve a more competitive and integrated EU market for data storage and/or processing services and activities. More specifically, this entails:</p><ul><li>Reducing the number and range of data localisation restrictions;</li><li>Enhancing legal certainty;</li><li>Facilitating cross-border availability of data for regulatory control purposes;</li><li>Improving the conditions under which users can switch data storage and/or processing service providers or port their data back to their own IT systems;</li><li>Increasing trust in and the security of cross-border data storage and/or processing.</li></ul><p>By November 2022, the Commission will have to report to the European Parliament, the Council and the EESC on how to the regulation is being applied.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474965"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474966"></a>Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions in the Internal Market and Repealing Directive 1999/93/EC</p><p>The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">Regulation (EU) No 910/2014</a> on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market, the eIDAS Regulation, is a major step in building a Digital Single Market and in boosting trust, security and convenience online, for governments, businesses and consumers. Thanks to eIDAS, the EU now has a predictable legal framework providing legal certainty beyond national borders for electronic identification (eID) and for electronic trust services (such as electronic signatures, seals, time stamping, delivery services and website authentication).</p><p>In this regard, the eIDAS Regulation:</p><ul><li>Ensured that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services in other EU countries where eIDs are available.</li><li>Created a European internal market for trust services by ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as traditional paper-based processes.</li></ul><p>With the eIDAS Regulation, the relevant implementing acts, and including standards as well as a technical interoperability infrastructure, which was rolled out under the Connecting Europe Facility, the EU became the first and only region in the world having a holistic, workable and balanced legal framework for cross-border use of electronic identification and trust services.</p><p>The eIDAS Regulation entered into force on 17 September 2014. It laid down specific application dates for the following:</p><ul><li>Rules on trust services (electronic signatures, seals, time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and website authentication) were directly applicable to all EU Member States since 1 July 2016.</li><li>While all Member States were required to recognise other Member States' notified eID means as of 29 September 2018, the voluntary recognition of eIDs has been allowed since 29 September 2015, following the adoption of relevant implementing acts. This meant that an EU Member State may, on a voluntary basis, notify and recognise national eID means that citizens and companies could use across borders to access online public services. To date (and the information is continuously updated), 25 Member States have national eID means in place, whether eID cards or other means.</li></ul><p>To this end, Member States have been working on setting up their national eIDAS nodes with help from the Connecting Europe Facility Programme of the Commission, i.e. the required infrastructure for the eID cross-border connection, and all are expected to be ready by the required deadline.</p><p>The European Commission, through its ‘Shaping Europe Digital Future’ communication aims at reviewing this Regulation and improve its effectiveness by extending its application to the private sector.</p><p>This initiative is built on the inception impact assessment conducted by the Commission on the eIDAS Regulation, which concluded that that potential of electronic identification and authentication under the current eIDAS remains underexploited.</p><p>At the end of 2020, the European Council asked the Commission to introduce an EU- wide digital ID system so as to secure users’ identification in both the private and public spheres. On 3 June 2021 the Commission proposed the framework for a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281">European Digital</a> <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281">Identity</a>. Under the new regulation, Member States will issue European Digital Identity Wallets that will enable users to access services online without using private identification methods or share unnecessary data. The proposal is accompanied by a Recommendation inviting Member States to cooperate within the framework to develop a digital toolbox. This toolbox should include a comprehensive technical architecture and reference framework, a set of common standards and technical references and a set of guidelines and descriptions of best practices covering at least all aspects of the functionalities and interoperability of the European Digital Identity Wallets.</p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle">EU space-based global secure communications system</p><p>The legislative initiative on building an EU space-based global secure communications system, with the purpose of offering broadband connectivity where it is currently missing, is expected in Q2 2022. </p><p>In this regard, on 15 February 2022, the Commission adopted the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/proposal_regulation_union_secure_connectivity_programme.pdf">proposal for a Regulation establishing the Union Secure Connectivity Programme for the period 2023-2027</a> following three policy objectives: </p><ul><li>Ensuring the provision of secure satellite communication for evolving public needs, </li><li>Increasing Member States and the Union resilience by guaranteed access to secure communication, </li><li>Avoiding critical dependencies on non-EU infrastructures as for governmental communication needs.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Review of the Directive on Security of Networks and Information Systems (NIS2)</p><p>In December 2020, the Commission adopted the proposal for the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-directive-measures-high-common-level-cybersecurity-across-union">revision of the</a> <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-directive-measures-high-common-level-cybersecurity-across-union">Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems </a>(NIS 2 Directive).</p><p>Despite the notable achievements of the NIS Directive, the digital transformation of our societies and economies, further boosted by the COVID-19 crisis, has identified new challenges and limitations in the current Directive, requiring tailored responses.</p><p>Indeed, the Commission proposal expands the scope of the current NIS Directive, aiming to reinforce the security requirements appointed, focusing on the security of supply chains, simplifying reporting obligations, introducing tougher supervisory measures and stricter enforcement requirements including harmonised sanctions across Member States. The proposal also includes a suggestion for information sharing and cooperation on cyber crisis management at national and at EU level.</p><p>The proposal is currently being discussed and negotiated between the co-legislators (the Council and the European Parliament).</p><p class="subtitle">Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 Concerning Measures for a High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Across the Union</p><p><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&amp;qid=1482413313776&amp;from=en">The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems </a>(the NIS Directive) was adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2016 and entered into force in August 2016. Member States were given 21 months to transpose the Directive and six months more to identify operators of essential services.</p><p>The Directive ensured Member States’ preparedness for cyber threats by requiring them to be appropriately equipped. They were required to establish a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) Network, in order to promote swift and effective operational cooperation on specific cybersecurity incidents and sharing information about risks. A culture of security across sectors was considered vital for the economy and society which relied heavily on ICT, such as energy, transport, water, banking, financial market infrastructures, healthcare and digital infrastructure.</p><p>In 2017, the Commission put forward a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2017-4460501_en">draft Implementing Regulation Pursuant Art</a> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2017-4460501_en">16(8) of the NIS Directive</a>.

Member States had two years to adapt their national laws to introduce the first set of provisions in the Directive, including a new obligation on business registers to make available documentation submitted by limited liability companies within 21 days of receipt. Ensuring that information about companies was always up to date was one of the main objectives of this Directive. Business registers were required to make available information on the rules in their national law, according to which third parties could rely on certain company documents. This information was also available on the <a href="https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_business_registers_in_member_states-106-en.do?clang=en">eJustice portal</a>.</p><p>The Directive also required a Business Registers Interconnection System (BRIS) to be established.

In order to do so, Your Europe offers information on basic rights under EU law, but also on how these rights are implemented in each individual country (where information has been provided by the national authorities). Free email or telephone contact with EU assistance services, to get more personalised or detailed help and advice is also available.</p><p>Please note that, in most cases, the EU rights described in <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe </a>apply to all EU member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and sometimes to Switzerland. Information on Your Europe is provided by the relevant departments of the European Commission and complemented by content provided by the authorities of every country it covers. In addition, the implementation of the single digital gateway allows citizens to perform more administrative procedures online.
