The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below. </p><p><img src="img/35-353.png" alt="35-353.png" /> </p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021 </p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Denmark in 2021.</p><p><img src="img/35-390.png" alt="35-390.png" />	</p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</p><p>Despite the lack of data for Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility), Denmark’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Areas of improvements are concentrated in Principle 9 (Multilingualism) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16).</p><p><img src="img/35-409.png" alt="35-409.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</p><p>The Danish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show a high performance with scores of 4 in all principles. The only potential area of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance and organisational interoperability. Specifically, the score of 3 for Denmark in Recommendation 22, stating that public administrations should use a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assessing and selecting standards and specifications, and in Recommendation 29, calling for clarification and formalisation or organisational relationships for establishing and operating public services, could be improved for a total implementation of interoperability layers for Denmark.</p><p><img src="img/35-425.png" alt="35-425.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</p><p>Denmark’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a high performance in the implementation of the majority of recommendations associated with the conceptual model itself, the internal and external information sources and services, base registries, open data and catalogues. The only area for a potential improvement is the indicator on security and privacy, more specifically in the implementation of Recommendation 47 which gets a score of 1, on the use of Trust Services operating in accordance to the Regulation on eID, and the absence of Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (Recommendation 47) which hinders Denmark’s score on the Security and Privacy section. However, due to Denmark’s centralised approach to trust services it is unlikely that Denmark will be able to improve its performance further on this indicator. It should be noted that an updated version of the common public sector login function is planned to be notified to the Commission.</p><p>Additional information on Denmark’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/members/denmark/">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The strategy builds on the recommendations from the Danish government’s ‘Digitisation Partnership’ and is the first of its kind in Denmark. The strategy calls for broad and binding collaboration on digital development across both the public and the private sector and contains nine visions identifying the next steps in Denmark’s digital development. In describing these visions, the strategy presents 61 specific initiatives. The initiatives pursue many significant goals, among which maintaining Denmark’s position as a digital front-runner and using digital solutions, new technology and data to strengthen Danish welfare, accelerate the green transition, increase growth and digital transformation of Danish SMEs and strengthen cyber and information security. In doing so, the strategy also acknowledges the challenges that may accompany an increasingly digitised society. Therefore, a core element of the strategy is to make sure that citizens are able to use and benefit from the digital services regardless of differences in their digital skills. This also entails ensuring that technology and data are used ethically and with a clear focus on security, responsibility, transparency and trust.</p><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Danish government signed the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other EU Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Public Administration and COVID-19</p><p>The public digital infrastructure has shown its worth during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it has enabled public services to uphold their high level even with a considerable degree of remote work within the State, regions and municipalities. Furthermore, the government has launched a range of new digital services to cope with COVID-19, including a contact-tracing app and the digital booking of tests and vaccines.</p><p>Thanks to digital-ready legislation and an advanced digital infrastructure, the central government was able to process <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/news/2020-11/Case Collection - Reducing administrative burdens with digital-ready legislation.pdf">COVID-19 stimulus checks</a> addressed to 2.2 million recipients in a fully automatic mode and in less than eight days.</p><p>Furthermore, 2.1 million residents were able to digitally apply for and receive early holiday allowance for a total value of approximately EUR 14.5 billion. The first round of the two holiday allowance pay-outs (EUR 7 billion in October 2020) resulted in a monthly increase in retail spending of 8.2% leading to the highest ever consumer spending index in the month of October 2020.</p><p>Finally, businesses were able to apply for the Danish stimulus packages for businesses during the pandemic <a href="https://virksomhedsguiden.dk/content/ydelser/kompensation-til-virksomheder-og-selvstaendige/be51dffe-da7b-4482-8a51-1568f8dc9966/">digitally</a> (<em>i.e.</em> for lost turnover), as the Danish <em>‘Virksomhedsguiden’</em> incorporated a platform for applications and the provision of information before the final settling of accounts in the Danish Business Authority.

The partnership involved top managers and experts from the Danish business community, the research community, civil society, stakeholders from the labour market, Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions. In October 2021, the partnership concluded its work and submitted <a href="https://en.digst.dk/media/24796/visions-and-recommendations-for-denmark-as-a-digital-pioneer-danish-government-digitisation-partnership.pdf">46 recommendations</a> on how Denmark can harness and utilise future technological opportunities. The recommendations offer suggestions for both the public and private sector as well as public-private collaboration. In May 2022, the Danish government presented a new national Digitalisation Strategy building upon the above-mentioned recommendations. The strategy lays out the main lines for digital development until 2030. Before launching the strategy, as part of a new reform package and of the Finance Act of 2022, the government decided on a few digital initiatives that addresses some of the recommendations. These initiatives, among other things, aim to strengthen the digital transformation of SMEs, ease the administrative procedures for companies when reporting to authorities, make public data more accessible to businesses, researchers and citizens, and strengthen the use of new technologies, such as AI in the public sector. Moreover, it focuses on strengthening data ethics and digital-ready legislation.</p><p class="subtitle">Strategy for Denmark’s Digital Growth</p><p>The <a href="http://www.blind.dk">Strategy for Denmark’s Digital Growth</a> encompasses a series of goals and actions fostering the digital transformation of Danish commerce and industry. More specifically, the strategy consists of 38 initiatives, allocating a total of EUR 112 million from 2018 to 2025 in order to support the digital transformation of small and medium-sized enterprises. Subsequently, the strategy foresees a EUR 10 million investment per year. Some of the key actions that the strategy includes are the following:  </p><ul><li>Digital enhancement of SMEs; </li><li>Digital hub for stronger digital growth;</li><li>Digital skills for all; </li><li>Data as driver of growth in trade and industry; </li><li>Agile regulation in the areas of trade and industry; and </li><li>Increased cybersecurity within companies.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Guidelines on How to Make Legislation Ready for Digitisation</p><p>A broad political agreement was reached in January 2018, requiring all legislation proposed after 1 July 2018 to comply with seven principles for <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/family/index_en.htm">digital-ready legislation</a>. The <a href="https://uk.rigsrevisionen.dk/">Guidelines on How to Make Legislation Digital-Ready</a> outline the <a href="http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do">principles</a> and how to apply them in the legislative process. </p><p>Additionally, all proposed legislation must be assessed for potential impacts regarding project risk, organisational changes, data protection and citizens’ rights. The findings must be described in the legislative proposal together with possible mitigating measures.</p><p>To ensure that legislation is digital-ready, every legislative proposal is screened for compliance with the guidelines and consultation responses are sent to the responsible ministries by a unit established within the Ministry of Finance. Since 2018, approximately 400 consultation responses were sent.</p><p>In support of this approach, a <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">course on digital-ready policymaking</a> is available to legislative drafters and policy officers in government departments.</p><p> </p><p>A report documenting the initiatives results was <a href="https://en.digst.dk/news/news-archive/2021/may/review-new-legislation-enables-responsible-digitisation-to-an-increasing-degree/">published</a> in May 2021. The report concludes among other things that the effort is well under way and that new legislation is increasingly digital-ready. The report however also shows that existing legislation has not been systematically reviewed for digital-readiness. </p><p>As part of the agreement on the Finance Act for 2022, it was decided to continue the work on ensuring that legislation is digital-ready.</p><p class="subtitle">Public Sector Digitisation Strategy: a Stronger and More Secure Digital Denmark (2016–2020)</p><p>The <a href="https://en.digst.dk/policy-and-strategy/digital-strategy/">Common Public Sector Digitisation Strategy</a> 2016–2020 (also known as ‘Digital Strategy’) was agreed between the Danish government, <a href="https://www.kl.dk/english/kl-local-government-denmark/">Local Government Denmark</a>, and Danish Regions and it entered into force in May 2016. The goal of the strategy was to help shape the future of digital Denmark and ensure that the public sector was prepared to seize the advantages of technology. The strategy covered numerous themes related to the digitisation of the public sector such as automation of administrative procedures, better user experience for citizens and businesses, digital welfare, data sharing, and others.</p><p>In 2021, a new set of initiatives was agreed between the Danish government, <a href="https://www.kl.dk/english/kl-local-government-denmark/">Local Government Denmark</a>, and Danish Regions, with the purpose of extending and strengthening the main goals of the Digital Strategy throughout 2021. </p><p class="subtitle">Strategy for ICT Management in Central Government</p><p>A <a href="https://en.digst.dk/policy-and-strategy/strategy-for-ict-management/">Strategy for ICT Management in Central Government</a> was launched on 21 November 2017, aiming to improve the operational management of information and communication technology (ICT) systems. The 13 initiatives forming the framework for a better management of ICT systems address issues such as the mandatory compliance to the central government’s ICT system portfolio management model and the periodic review by the National ICT Council of each ministry’s ICT system management. The initiatives also address the development of cross-governmental network activities amongst leaders and employees working with digitalisation and developing the technical and professional competencies and skills required to manage ICT.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">Common Framework for Public-Sector Digital Architecture (Danish NIF)</p><p>In 2017, the central government, Local Government Denmark, and Danish Regions agreed on a common<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/news/new-level-cooperation-isa²-building-interoperable-europe_en"> Federal Digital Architecture</a> (FDA) focusing on data sharing and cross-organisational processes. The FDA includes a general framework as well as a number of specific architecture assets. The core is a set of general architecture principles and rules supported by guidelines on architecture description and communication, rules for concept, and data modelling. Activities such as skill development, architecture guidance and project reviews support the adoption of the common framework. The FDA includes a number of concrete architecture assets like reference architectures on common issues such as the sharing of data and documents, user and rights management across domains, coherent user journeys in relation to digital self-services, and user-centric and cross-cutting overview of data relevant to each citizen and enterprise (e.g. in relation to cases, payments, debt, appointments and deadlines). </p><p>Finally, the FDA encompasses a number of common technical solutions such as the national infrastructure solutions for ID, Digital Signature, Single Sign On and Digital Post, among others.</p><p>The application of the <a href="https://indberet.virk.dk/">general governance structure</a> is voluntary depending on relevance, logic, and business case. Nonetheless, some elements such as the digital signature and digital post are mandatory. Projects falling within the common public sector strategies shall take the FDA into account and undergo an architecture review. </p><p class="subtitle">Rules for Concept and Data Modelling</p><p>It is important that authorities and businesses are able to retrieve, understand, and reuse data in the public sector. Therefore, the Common Public Sector Digital Architecture recommends applying the <a href="http://www.regioner.dk/">Rules for Concept and Data Modelling</a> to document concepts and data. The rules ensure that concepts and data are described and documented thoroughly, correctly, and consistently whilst reusing national and international models, standards and experiences to the extent possible. </p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>Open Government Partnership Action Plan (2019–2021)</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/index_en.htm">Open Government Partnership</a>, which is an international collaboration, the Danish government drafted a fourth <a href="https://twitter.com/Joinup_eu">National Action Plan (2019–2021)</a> with seven initiatives from various parts of the Danish public sector aiming at strengthening trust and transparency in public authorities, especially in public sector digitalisation.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>NemID Digital Signature and the New Danish eID, MitID</p><p>Since 1 July 2010, <a href="https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx">NemID</a>, the national digital signature, has provided easy and safe access to a wide range of public and private self-service solutions on the web, including eBanking, tax forms, insurance and pension funds. NemID is a central element in the digital infrastructure and is a part of the everyday life of many citizens and businesses. NemID is used to either sign a document digitally or verify a user’s identity when entering a self-service. More than 5.3 million citizens aged 15 or more have a personal NemID, and more than half a million companies use NemID to log in to digital self-service solutions (e.g. <a href="https://ast.dk/">Virk</a> and <a href="https://rm.coe.int/16806af0e6">Digital Post</a>) on behalf of the business entity, which makes reporting to the public sector easier. </p><p>NemID is the result of the collaboration between the State, municipalities and regions, the financial sector, and a private contractor.

Regions are now investing in developing and replacing electronic health record systems, and municipalities are radically changing the way they use health data by implementing structured electronic medical records. The strategy creates a foundation for a joint digitalisation effort of the entire Danish health system. By strengthening the digital foundation for providing healthcare across the sector, the strategy – when implemented – will also strengthen the security of personal health data and enable the safe and secure exchange of relevant data in the health sector.</p><p class="subtitle">Strategy for Denmark’s Tech Diplomacy 2021−2023</p><p>In 2017, the Danish government appointed the first World’s Tech Ambassador with the aim to strengthen Denmark’s access to, relations with and influence on large tech companies across the world. </p><p>In February 2021, the Danish government launched the <a href="https://sikkerdigital.dk/">Strategy for Denmark’s Tech Diplomacy 2021−2023</a> consisting of three principles that are central to future technological development: (i) responsibility is key and the tech industry should meet its societal responsibility and operate on a level-playing field; (ii) democracy should be the premise of governance, also in a digital world. Global digital governance should build on democratic values and human rights; and (iii) security is central and technology should support Denmark safety and security. In addition, a flagship project ‘Tech for Democracy Initiative’ was launched. It kick-started a multi-stakeholder push for protecting and promoting human rights and democratic values in an era of rapid technological development. So far, it produced an international conference with participation of leading voices from the tech industry, civil society and governmental bodies, the launch of the Copenhagen Pledge for stakeholders to sign up to as well as a number of multi-stakeholder action coalitions during the Year of Action in 2022.</p><p class="subtitle">White Paper: Towards a Better Social Contract with Tech Giants </p><p>In June 2021, the Danish government published a <a href="https://techamb.um.dk/-/media/country-sites/techamb-en/media/white-paper-engelsk-version-.ashx">White Paper</a> with a proposal for debate and nine principles for a more responsible and fair society with major tech companies.

The portal is a shared infrastructure funded by national, regional and local authorities. The Citizen Portal also contains an English <a href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/">sub-site for international citizens</a>. The Citizen Portal provides general, location-specific (e.g. region or municipality) and personal information, data and eServices for citizens, including access to Digital Post (more information on Digital Post below). In addition, the Citizen Portal features a range of ‘self-service’ solutions, allowing citizens to manage their communications with the public sector effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, a single sign-on solution allows citizens to receive and access information and services from several agencies, without having to log on several times.</p><p>The portal currently contains more than 2 000 self-service solutions. In 2021, 70.7 million visits were reported in the portal (with a population of 5.8 million citizens). The Citizen Portal offers a user-friendly interface, personalisation of content and syndication of borger.dk content, as well as flexibility for authorities wishing to add location-specific content to the portal. The most recent user survey shows that 92% of the users are ‘satisfied’ or ‘very satisfied’ with the Citizen Portal and 91% of the users feel safe using it.</p><p class="subtitle">My Overview</p><p>My Overview is the citizens’ personal page on the Citizen Portal. Here, citizens can log on using their MitID to access some of the personal information public authorities have registered, such as information on tax, debt, student grants, or housing as well as status on benefits and ongoing cases with public authorities, upcoming agreements, and deadlines. The development of My Overview is part of a joint public political vision for creating transparency, and a better and more coherent digital service in the public sector. The overview is personalised, and therefore no one but the citizens themselves have access to the data on the site. My Overview is a supplement to existing websites or self-service solutions offering a wider digital overview of a citizen’s data and interactions with the public sector as well as links to the relevant public websites. New public authorities join My Overview every year and display relevant information and data to citizens.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Guides to Life Events</p><p>The Agency for Digital Government and the Danish Business Authority are developing Digital Guides to support coherent user journeys in relation to the eleven most common life events for <a href="https://digiplace.sharepoint.com/sites/WE-EUROPEANCOMMISSION-ABCIV-SC442/Shared Documents/D04.01 Digital Public Administration factsheets and infographics/Country factsheets 2021/Denmark/Factsheet/-	www.borger.dk/flytteguide">citizens</a> and the ten most common life events for <a href="https://virk.dk/assistent">businesses</a>. The Guides provide citizens and businesses with a personalised overview of what they need to know and understand regarding their life event and give them a collection of relevant links to e.g. public services and self-service solutions. The Guides are published on the portals <a href="http://www.statens-it.dk">borger.dk</a> (citizens) and virk.dk (businesses). The Guides will be further developed as new user needs are identified, and so will be the architecture supporting them. </p><p class="subtitle">Virk.dk - Business Portal</p><p>The Business Portal <a href="http://uk.fm.dk/">Virk.dk</a> is the common public<strong> </strong>web portal<strong> </strong>for<strong> </strong>businesses, allowing them to handle their reporting obligations towards the public sector. The overall objective of Virk.dk is to relieve Danish businesses from administrative burdens and provide a single entrance to the public sector. The Portal contains more than 1 000 eForms, and in 2020 user sessions on Virk.dk totalled 23 million.</p><p>Virk.dk also features a personalised dashboard for businesses to provide them with an overview of current deadlines, tasks and obligations towards public authorities. The dashboard contains basic information on the business, a calendar, access to Digital Post, access to the user administration interface and a few services with information from specific public authorities. The dashboard is continuously expanded with new services. </p><p>In addition to Virk.dk, a Business Promotion Portal called ‘<a href="https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx">The Business Guide’ (<em>Virksomhedsguiden</em>)</a> was launched in 2019, aiming to provide information and services to start ups and businesses in Denmark on how to start, run and develop a business. The platform gathers guidance on the most relevant business regulations from more than 16 different authorities, as well as guidance on starting, running and developing a business. At the launch, the platform contained more than 150 digital articles and tools, spanning from regulation on how to hire your first employee and how to pay VAT to how to improve your sales technique and how to write a business plan. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital Post</p><p>Digital Post is the public authorities' shared IT solution that enables to communicate securely with citizens, companies, and other governmental institutions.</p><p>Today, approx. 4.4 million citizens, 680 000 businesses use and receive Digital Post, and 400 authorities are part of the system and use it to send Digital Post messages.</p><p> </p><p>In March 2022, Denmark got a new <a href="https://lifeindenmark.borger.dk/apps-and-digital-services/Digital-Post">Digital Post solution</a>. The public sector will have increased ownership of the new Digital Post solution, which will provide greater flexibility, adapt to future needs and ensure better coherence with other public IT solutions. The new Digital Post will resemble the current solution, so that the many citizens and companies that currently use Digital Post today will experience an improved user-friendliness providing a more coherent and easily accessible IT solution.</p><p class="subtitle">Real Property Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/">Real Property Portal</a> contains articles, step-by-step guides, tools and documents designed to make it easier and more secure for users, i.e., businesses and citizens, to sell or buy homes. The portal also provides an overview of the buying and selling processes at work. The portal thus offers an insight into housing transaction processes designed to prepare the property owner to engage with professional advisers. Several tools and documents enable property owners to carry out parts of a housing transaction single-handedly. Furthermore, property owners get access to large national databases containing data about buildings and can get acquainted with/or updated on rules regarding business rentals, purchase and rental of summer houses and holiday homes as well as real estate services.</p><p class="subtitle">‘Live’ Operational Status</p><p>On the site <a href="http://www.datatilsynet.dk/english/">Digitalisér.dk/services</a>, businesses and citizens are able to see the operational status ‘live’ on common public sector digital services. The operational status service covers the following public key services: the Single-Sign-In solution <a href="http://uk.fm.dk/">NemLogin</a>; the eID/digital signature solution <a href="http://www.kl.dk/English/Local-Government-Denmark/">NemID</a>; the national Citizen Portal <a href="https://virksomhedsguiden.dk/erhvervsfremme/content/">borger.dk</a>; the eCommerce register solution <a href="http://www.nemhandel.dk/">NemHandel</a>; the bank account register for public sector transfers <a href="https://www.nemkonto.dk/">NemKonto</a>; and <a href="https://www.borger.dk/internet-og-sikkerhed/Digital-Post/Post">Digital Post</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">National Portal for Cyber and Information Security</p><p>An information portal, <a href="https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx">sikkerdigital.dk</a>, was established with readily accessible information, advice, and specific tools for citizens, businesses and authorities regarding information security and data protection, as well as information on how to comply with current legislation in those fields. The portal is managed jointly by mainly the Agency for Digital Government and the Danish Business Authority in collaboration with various other authorities and NGOs.</p><p class="subtitle">Automated Business Reporting</p><p>It has been estimated that increased automation of companies’ bookkeeping practices and financial reporting entails yearly efficiency savings of EUR 400 million in Denmark. By introducing digital and automated bookkeeping processes, demanding manual processes and administrative burdens are minimised and companies’ resources can be used to solve the companies’ core tasks. Equally, it allows for digitalised and automated interactions with the authorities, thereby reporting accounting information easily and in real time. The Danish government therefore plans to introduce regulation that will require the vast majority of Danish companies to use digital accounting systems, thus benefitting individual companies, authorities and the general economy. </p><p>Automated Business Reporting also provides clear benefits for the authorities both through potential efficiency savings and also through a more targeted auditing and financial monitoring. Increased automation and digitalisation in the companies allow for a more efficient monitoring by the authorities. Equally, when financial records are kept in digital accounting systems, any changes in the records are logged and disclosed to the authorities. Based on this information, authorities can target monitoring operations and minimise the amount of audits made on law-abiding companies. Consequently, authorities are able to combat economic crime and tax fraud more efficiently.  </p><p>Finally, Automated Business Reporting will have a clear positive effect on the economy at large, as the projected GDP-effects are estimated to be at least EUR 255 million.</p><p class="subtitle">Climate Compass</p><p>To give businesses a user-friendly, transparent, and uniform tool to calculate their carbon footprint and gain an overview of how their climate impact is spread across activities over time, the Danish Business Authority and the Danish Energy Agency have introduced the ‘Climate Compass’ tool, which targets SMEs. </p><p>The Compass allows businesses to: (i) calculate direct carbon emissions of company activities (i.e. own transportation and oil and gas consumption); (ii) calculate the indirect carbon emissions from their energy providers, subcontractors and customers; and (iii) estimate the climate impact of various carbon-reducing initiatives in the company. Currently, further functionalities of the Climate Compass are being developed.</p><h3>Subnational Portals</h3><p class="subtitle">Local Government Denmark and Danish Regions</p><p>One of the overall objectives of digitalisation in Denmark is to associate the relevant levels of government. Thus, LGDK and DR are also involved in several of the nationally operated portals, e.g. borger.dk and sikkerdigital.dk.</p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle">Broadband Speed</p><p>Denmark has good high-speed broadband coverage, also in rural areas. The broadband target set at political level (all households and businesses shall have access to 100/30 Mbps) was confirmed in 2021, and a new target was agreed stating that 98% of households and businesses shall have access to infrastructure capable of delivering gigabit speed by 2025. In 2021, 96% of all households and businesses are covered with minimum 100/30 Mbps and 90% are covered with gigabit. An ambitious commercial roll-out of high-speed fixed broadband is expected. Consequently, a recent forecast estimate that 99% of all households and businesses will be covered with fixed high-speed broadband in the mid 2020s. Currently, 98% of Denmark is estimated to be covered with 5G by one or more mobile operators. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Data Distributor</p><p>The <a href="https://www.retsinformation.dk/eli/lta/2018/439">Data Distributor</a> is the main channel for accessing basic data from several authorities. It replaces a series of public distribution solutions and ensures that authorities and companies are provided with easy and safe access to basic data in one collective system, rather than resorting to many different systems and interfaces. By now, the Data Distributor samples a unique variety of basic data, e.g<em>.</em> civil registration numbers, registered data on land, properties, parcels and buildings, registered data on companies, registered data on addresses, administrative divisions and place names, geographical base maps, geodata, etc. More data will be constantly made available on the Data Distributor.</p><p class="subtitle">Reference Architecture for Sharing Data and Documents</p><p>Denmark has published a reference architecture to facilitate the sharing of data and documents electronically. The reference architecture revolves around describing the disclosure of data by transmission. Disclosure by transmission focuses on the actual action of passing on data, whereas the interpretation of the sharing of data is broader and includes making data available for potential reuse, even if data may never be accessed. One of the main purposes of this reference architecture is to guide and assist in the choice between two fundamental business patterns for the disclosure of data by transmission:</p><ul><li>Transmission on request: typically, system-to-system integrations using an API; and</li><li>Transmission by message: typically, the legally binding communication of data (possibly in the form of documents) from public authorities to citizens and businesses, but also a classical pattern in system-to-system integrations.</li></ul><p>The fundamental difference between these two scenarios is whether it is the actor transmitting data or the actor receiving data, who is responsible for the concrete data process flow.</p><p class="subtitle">New Application Profiles</p><p>A Danish application profile of version 2.0 of the <a href="https://eng.em.dk/media/13081/305755-gb-version_4k.pdf">DCAT Application Profile</a> for data portals in Europe (DCAT-AP) has been completed and approved for use in the context of the Danish public sector (DCAT-AP-DK). </p><p>Furthermore, to support higher reuse and quality of metadata about IT systems, two application profiles have been established: a Basic Application Profile describing the core properties of public sector IT systems and an Archive Application Profile extending the basic profile elements relevant to the submission of information about IT systems to the National Archives.</p><p>In addition, a method for describing Dataset Quality has been established. The method has been developed on the basis of international standards such as the W3C Data on the Web Best Practices, including the Data Quality Vocabulary, and ISO 25012 on Data Quality.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">NemID Digital Signature and the New Danish eID, MitID</p><p>More information can be found in Section 3.3.2 (eID and Trust Services).</p><p class="subtitle">eIDAS eID-Gateway Node</p><p>The Danish eIDAS infrastructure, called the <a href="https://en.digst.dk/digitisation/eid-and-digital-self-services-across-the-eueea/">eID-Gateway</a>, went into production on 28 September 2018. The eID-Gateway consists of the DK eIDAS Connector and the DK eIDAS Proxy Service. Currently, 75 eServices are connected to the DK eIDAS Connector and work is in progress to integrate other notified eIDs. The eID Gateway is connected to existing eServices and utilises the existing national SAML protocol, which is also implemented in the national broker for public services, NemLog-in, described further down. Denmark was one of the first countries to recognise the German eID and by the end of 2020 citizens from eleven different EU Member States were able to access Danish eServices, with more following in 2021. Work is continuing to provide solutions for identity matching, a functionality in the eIDAS Connector, which went in pilot on 18 January 2022, as well as to keep supporting businesses and their employees in accessing connected eServices.</p><p>In April 2020, Denmark completed the process of notifying the Danish eID, NemID, in accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market with the publication in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU). Denmark finalised the implementation of the necessary technical changes in the NemID infrastructure at the end of 2021, making it possible for the other EU Member States to integrate NemID in their respective eIDAS Nodes. The same is expected to be possible with the new Danish eID, MitID, in the beginning of the third quarter of 2022. The Danish eIDAS Proxy Service went live on 25 November 2021.</p><p class="subtitle">NOBID Project</p><p>Denmark is a member of the Nordic-Baltic Cooperation on Digital Identities (NOBID), a project initiated and managed by the Nordic Council of Ministers supporting the implementation and utilisation of the national eID infrastructure. The goal is to provide citizens and businesses using their own national eIDs borderless access to digital services throughout the Nordic-Baltic region. Technical and legal barriers have been identified, and requirements have been set for enabling interoperability both nationally and in a Nordic-Baltic context.</p><p> </p><p>NOBID has been extended until the end of 2024 and has become a sub-project under the Cross-Border Digital Service Programme (CBDS) with the aim of creating a common Nordic-Baltic platform for the implementation of parts of the eIDAS Regulation and the Single Digital Gateway Regulation.</p><p class="subtitle">NemLog-in: Sign-In Solution</p><p>NemLog-in is a vital part of the public infrastructure and is the primary joint identity broker/identity provider solution. It also serves as integration point for public IT service providers and self-service solutions.</p><p>NemLog-in consists of a number of components that make up the Danish national platform for login and user access management. Established in 2008, NemLog-in is today in its third generation with over 150 IT service providers. It offers 500 self-service solutions and records more than a 100 million logins a year. One of the primary components is a login/authentication service with Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality. Citizens, employees in companies and authorities can log on to public self-services solutions and portals. Other NemLog-in components include central user access management, a signing service (including signature validation and possibly long-term storage), a power of attorney functionality and a Security Token Service (STS) functionality. Lastly, NemLog-in provides an administration component, where IT service providers and IT vendors can maintain their self-service solution integrations to NemLog-in.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Driving License App (<em>Kørekort-appen</em>) and Digital Health Card</p><p>Since 24 November 2020, Danish citizens have been able to download their driving license in a <a href="https://digst.dk/it-loesninger/koerekort-app/">new app</a> (information not available in English) and leave their physical driving license at home. With more than 500 000 downloads of the new app in the 24 hours after its release, almost 750 000 in the first week, and now almost 2 million citizens have quickly adopted the new digital driving license.</p><p>Citizens who wish to subscribe to the app must possess a Danish driving licence, a NemID or MitID and a Danish passport. Users simply log in with their eID and scan their passport in order to download the passport photo to their driving license app. </p><p>The app has a built-in QR-code that enables the Danish police to use their dedicated app to confirm the digital driving license validity without touching the driver's phone. The app also displays a secondary QR-code with less information, which can be used as proof of identity, for instance to buy age-restricted products or pick up a parcel at the post office. The digital driving license app is only valid within the Danish borders.</p><p>The Agency for Digital Government followed up the launch of the Digital Driving License app with yet another digitised version of Danish citizens' universally issued ID-cards: in June 2021 the Agency launched the ‘Health Card App’, that entitles residents in Denmark to medical treatment. The Health Card App has achieved more than 2 million downloads since the launch. </p><p>Neither the digital driving license app nor the Digital Health Card replace the physical ID-cards. Physical driving licenses will still be assigned upon passing the driving test, and the health insurance card will also be issued physically. </p><p class="subtitle">Corona Passport</p><p>In May 2021, the Danish Ministry of Health, launched the <a href="https://cpr.dk/">new ‘Corona Passport App</a>’, which is designed to make everyday life as easy as possible for citizens in Denmark during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the Corona Passport app, citizens can easily present test results, vaccination or immunity passports, in a safe, reliable and privacy-respecting manner. The Corona Passport mobile app thus ensures quick and easy admission to restaurants, cultural venues or similar establishments.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474994"></a>Procurement Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.udbudsportalen.dk/">Procurement Portal</a> offers public and private providers guidance on the knowledge and tools necessary for the provision of tendering services. The purpose of the Portal is to facilitate cooperation between enterprises and the public sector as a means to promote public services efficiently. Furthermore, some regional and local authorities make use of private marketplaces. The State-owned company <a href="http://www.ski.dk">National Procurement Ltd (SKI)</a> has set up simpler eTendering solutions systems (<a href="https://www.ethics.dk/ethics/eo#/SKI/"><em>NetIndkøb</em></a> <em>&amp;</em> <em>Netkatalog</em>).</p><p class="subtitle">Nemhandel</p><p><em>Nemhandel</em> is an open network with its own document standards, making eProcurement between suppliers of goods and public authorities and institutions easy, secure and efficient. <em>Nemhandel</em> functions as one common standard for eProcurement and makes it possible for all businesses to connect once and reach all - irrespective of the purchasing system or the IT service provider.</p><p><em>Nemhandel</em> has continuously and actively participated in European and international cooperation for e-procurement. In 2017, <em>Nemhandel</em> began to be integrated into Peppol, and in the years 2019 and 2020, it became mandatory for all public authorities to be affiliated to the Peppol network, via the <em>Nemhandel</em> Registry, which is also a Peppol registry. From January 2023, Peppol-based eCatalogues and eOrders will also be mandatory for public entities for certain categories of goods and services.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">NemKonto</p><p>Most Danish citizens and companies occasionally receive payments from the public sector. These payments can be tax or VAT refunds, child subsidies, pensions, student loans, unemployment benefits, housing support or social welfare payments etc. All payments from public institutions are transferred directly to what is called a NemKonto account. </p><p>All citizens and companies registered in Demark are required to have a NemKonto. A NemKonto is a normal bank account that you assign as your NemKonto. Some private enterprises such as insurance and pension companies, are also able to make payments to a NemKonto as well. </p><h2>Knowledge Management<a id="_Toc1474997"></a></h2><p class="subtitle">Multi-Platform Knowledge Management</p><p>Knowledge management related to the Danish digital public administration infrastructure is distributed across a number of platforms and websites and managed by various government bodies. </p><p>The Agency for Digital Government is responsible for website hosting methodology, reference architectures, and specifications related to cross cutting digital government. The target group includes ministries, regions and municipalities, and the focus is on general digital government capabilities and interoperability. The agency is also responsible for a catalogue of core concepts and data models used across government as well as a central portal harvesting metadata from decentralised data catalogues. A new and thoroughly revised metadata portal is expected to be launched during 2022, which aims to be fully compatible with the European data portal (see also Section 3.3.4 above). Furthermore, the Agency is responsible for a number of web sites and repositories supporting specific infrastructure solutions and digital government projects.</p><h2>Cross-Border Platforms<a id="_Toc1474998"></a></h2><p class="subtitle">Government Cloud Services and CEF eDelivery Services</p><p>Work is currently ongoing to support the public sector use of cloud offerings, including the guidance on the use of cloud services published in November 2019 and the provision of various cloud offerings to government bodies serviced by the Agency for Governmental IT Services (see also Sections <a href="#_Cloud_computing">3.5.4</a> and <a href="#_Cloud_computing_1">6.10.4</a>).</p><p>CEF eDelivery supports various cross-border domain solutions such as eInvoicing, Business Register Interconnected Systems and Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information.

Free email or telephone contact with EU assistance services, to get more personalised or detailed help and advice is also available.</p><p>Please note that, in most cases, the EU rights described in Your Europe apply to all EU member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and sometimes to Switzerland. Information on Your Europe is provided by the relevant departments of the European Commission and complemented by content provided by the authorities of every country it covers.

Indeed, enhanced interoperability will be necessary to unlock the potential of data use and reuse for improved public services, to enable cross-border collaboration, and to support the sector-specific policy goals set by the Commission for the future.</p><p>Interoperable Europe will lead the process of achieving these goals and creating a reinforced interoperability policy that will work for everyone.
