There are: Identification (eID), Electronic documents (eDocuments), Authoritative Sources, and Digital Post. Digital Post refers to the possibility that governments communicate electronically-only with citizens or entrepreneurs through e.g. personal mailboxes or other digital mail solutions.</li></ul><p>These top-level benchmarks are measured using a life-events (e.g. mystery shopping) approach. Eight life events are included in the overall eGovernment performance score.

The life events measured in 2017 were Regular business operations, Moving, Owning and driving a car and Starting a small claims procedure. The life events measured in 2018 are Business start-up, Losing and finding a job, Family life and Studying. </p><p><img src="img/35-153.png" alt="35-153.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/egovernment-benchmark-2018-digital-efforts-european-countries-are-visibly-paying">eGovernment Benchmark Report 2018 Country Factsheet </a></p><h1><a id="_Toc13229276"></a>Digital Government Highlights</h1><p class="subtitle">Digital Government Political Communications</p><p>The <a href="https://www.tekoalyaika.fi/en/background/">Artificial Intelligence Programme</a> was launched with the aim of steering Finland towards the age of AI, taking into consideration measures reaching far into the future and at the same time measures that are relevant today.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Government Legislation</p><p>Three new pieces of digital legislation recently came into force:</p><p><a href="https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190306">Act on Providing Digital Services</a>;</p><p><a href="https://stm.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/sosiaali-ja-terveystietojen-tietoturvallinen-hyodyntaminen">Act on Secondary Use of Health and Social Data</a>; </p><p><a href="https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190241">Act on eInvoices</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Government Governance</p><p>The law on a new Digital and Population Data Agency was approved and the new Agency will start in the beginning of 2020.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Government Infrastructure</p><p>New digital infrastructure was put in place in Finland:</p><p>Third parties were granted the power to <a href="https://www.vero.fi/en/e-file/mytax/">file taxes online</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.suomi.fi/e-authorizations-identification/">eAuthorisations service</a> verifies a person’s or organisation’s authorisation to use digital services.</p><p>A <a href="https://yhteentoimiva.suomi.fi/en/">semantic interoperability workbench</a> was implemented.</p><p>Two new important  registers have been created: <a href="https://www.vero.fi/en/incomes-register/">incomes register</a> and <a href="https://mmm.fi/en/article/-/asset_publisher/osakehuoneistojen-tiedot-uuteen-rekisteriin-vuodesta-2019-alka-1">register of housing company shares</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Government Services for Citizens and Businesses</p><p>Citizens can benefit from the following new services:</p><p>A new service for <a href="https://ajokortti-info.fi/en">applying for and changing one’s driving licence</a>.</p><p>The national study credit, degree and qualification disclosure service <a href="https://minedu.fi/artikkeli/-/asset_publisher/uusi-valtakunnallinen-palvelu-kokoaa-opinto-ja-tutkintotiedot-yhteen-paikkaan"><em>Koski</em></a> brings together all study credits, degrees and qualifications stored in different data warehouses.</p><p>A new eHealth service, <a href="https://www.omaolo.fi/"><em>Omaolo</em></a>, was launched.</p><h1><a id="_Toc13229277"></a>Digital Government Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific political communications on digital government</h2><p class="subtitle">Digitalisation of Public Services in the Government Programme </p><p>In the Programme of the Government, the goal for the next ten years is for Finland to make a productivity leap in public services and the private sector by grasping the opportunities offered by digitalisation, dismantling unnecessary regulation and cutting red tape. According to the Programme, public services are to be primarily digital. </p><p>As part of the implementation of the Programme, Prime Minister Mr Juha Sipilä and Minister of Local Government and Public Reforms Ms Anu Vehviläinen issued an open letter requesting proposals on how to contribute to digitalisation. More than 260 proposals from public administration, businesses, NGOs and citizens were submitted as a response to the letter. </p><p>In addition to, and as a part of the implementation of the Programme, the renewed principles for digitalisation were published in February 2016. The principles were directed at the public sector and municipalities whose work is related to processes modernisation through ICT. These principles were drafted in wide collaboration with stakeholders. They drew on good practices developed in Finland and abroad.</p><p>In order for services to become primarily digital, amendments to current legislation are needed. The Public Sector ICT has launched a process for renewing legislation to meet the demands required. </p><p>In 2017, the Finnish government adopted a <a href="http://vm.fi/artikkeli/-/asset_publisher/tyoryhmatyo-digipalveluiden-tiekartasta-valmistunut">roadmap</a> to advance digital services.

There have arisen a number of legislative and ethical questions and issues. Yet government policy measures lacked central cohesion. As a result, in December 2018 the Government submitted a report to Parliament on Information Policy and Artificial Intelligence.  </p><p>The report highlighted several policy issues with a particular focus on the ethics of information policy and artificial intelligence. The report marked the beginning of a new and more cohesive policy response to digital government. The report sought to: </p><p>Formulate a common and comprehensive information policy, tapping into the information principles in place in different fields and the measures taken on the basis of experiences.</p><p>Build a knowledge society that is sustainable both in terms of human wellbeing, safety and security and with regard to the economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions.</p><p>Clarify information policy guidelines and principles so as to create a foundation for measures aimed at strengthening the competitiveness and decision-making capacity of Finland, businesses operating in the country and other social actors.</p><p>Build Finland up as an attractive operating environment for the data economy.</p><p>Form Finland’s position, on the basis of which Finland will make pioneering efforts to influence the international operating environment, commitments and regulatory framework relating to the use of information.</p><p>Consolidate the ethical values at the core of making information policy choices and developing artificial intelligence, including fundamental and human rights, social inclusion, responsibility, trust, safety and security.</p><p>Promote the ability to analyse, anticipate and respond to threats in a changing operating environment.</p><p>The Parliament approved the report in March 2019 with few statements. The Parliament obliged the Government to continue its work on ethical principles on information policy and artificial intelligence to formulate them in more concrete. The Parliament also required Government to take necessary actions to increase citizens understanding on digitalisation and artificial intelligence and strengthen the human competence in these matters at different educational degrees and in different branch of sciences. </p><h1><a id="_Toc13229278"></a>Digital Government Legislation</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474962"></a>Specific legislation on digital government</h2><p class="subtitle">Act on Public Administration Information Management </p><p>A new <a href="http://finlex.fi/fi/esitykset/he/2018/20180284">Public Administration Information Management Act</a> was prepared, which included the regulation of public administration information management.

The interoperability method will help users create and maintain the semantic interoperability of information, i.e. data processing where meaning in flows of data remains the same. The interoperability platform is intended for both public administration and the private sector.  The tools are available free of charge for creating and editing terminologies and concepts, managing code lists, and creating and editing data models. Data content producers are responsible for their own data specifications and their quality, and for keeping them up to date. Users can also use previously created data specifications that are available on the interoperability platform.  Using existing code lists and data models in the user’s own system development is cost-effective and improves interoperability between the systems of different actors.
