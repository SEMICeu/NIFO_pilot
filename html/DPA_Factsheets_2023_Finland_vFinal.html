The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-52.png" alt="32-52.png" /></p><p> Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022 </a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Finland in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-68.x-emf" alt="32-68.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Finnish results in Scoreboard 1 showcase an overall very good implementation of the 12 EIF Principles. Indeed, Finland performs above the EU average on 10 out of 12 Principles. Potential areas of improvement are related to Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Finland could further evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits (Principle 12 – Recommendation 19) in order to also reach the highest score on this Principle. </p><p><img src="img/32-78.x-emf" alt="32-78.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Finland’s scores in Scoreboard 2 illustrate an overall good implementation of the interoperability layers, with only scores of 3 and 4. Areas of improvement to strengthen the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 concern legal interoperability and organisational interoperability, where the county received a score of 3. More specifically, Finland should work on documenting its business processes using commonly accepted modelling techniques and agree on how these processes should be aligned to deliver a European public service (Organisational interoperability – Recommendation 28) as well as to continue ensuring that its legislation is screened by means of ‘interoperability checks’, to identify any barriers to interoperability.  </p><p><img src="img/32-86.x-emf" alt="32-86.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Finnish scores on the Conceptual Model, in Scoreboard 3, show a good performance, with the country only receiving scores of 3 and 4.  Potential areas of improvement to strengthen the country’s implementation of the recommendations related to the conceptual model are on the Conceptual model itself and on the area of Security and Privacy. More specifically, Finland should decide on a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service component and put in place and maintain the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining European public services (Conceptual model – Recommendation 35), in order to improve its score in this area.</p><p><img src="img/32-94.x-emf" alt="32-94.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Finland on Scoreboard 4 related to the Cross-Border Interoperability aspect show an overall good implementation. Indeed, Finland received the highest score of 4 on eight Principles, three interoperability layers and three areas of the conceptual model. However, Finland still has room for improvement in relation to Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility – Cross-border), where the country should further ensure that all European public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Recommendation 14). Improvements could also be made to the Conceptual model area of Security and Privacy, and most particularly with regard to the country’s use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (Recommendation 47).  </p><p>Additional information on Finland’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="img/32-102.png" alt="32-102.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc140672757"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Finnish government signed the <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/EN/eu-presidency/gemeinsame-erklaerungen/berlin-declaration-digital-society.pdf;jsessionid=3C079021929382844AA0F4B7D8EE3023.1_cid287?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=6">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other EU Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies.

The plan is funded by the one-off EU recovery package ‘Next Generation EU’ and forms a part of the Finnish <a href="https://vm.fi/en/sustainable-growth-programme-for-finland">Sustainable Growth Programme</a>. </p><p>The programme will support growth that is ecologically, socially and economically sustainable in line with the aims of the Government Programme. To do so, the government is selecting investment projects and reforms that can achieve a long-term positive impact. The aim is to promote structural adjustment of the economy through specific packages of measures. In the digital field, the goals of the Sustainable Growth Programme for Finland are to create a competitive operating environment for businesses and to turn Finland into a world-class producer of data-driven services for digital societies, together with secure solutions for these services (including solutions that promote digitisation in the transport sector). The programme will strengthen the digital transition in the Finnish society through measures that boost digital, technological and data investments. </p><p class="subtitle">Strategy for Public Governance Renewal</p><p>In the framework of the Strategy for Public Governance and Services of Prime Minister Sanna Marin’s Government Programme, the Finnish government released in December 2020 its <a href="https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/162573">Strategy for Public Governance Renewal</a>. This strategy will guide and enhance the renewal of public governance as a whole from 2020 to 2030. In particular, it seeks to strengthen good governance across the country and in both national languages and, more specifically, to improve digital accessibility and encourage wider use of plain language in administration. A consistent and determined renewal of governance as described in the strategy will streamline everyday services, ensure legal certainty in society, and create new opportunities for businesses and communities. </p><p>The direction and means of administrative reform were defined together with various administrative sectors, municipalities, civil society, researchers and numerous stakeholders to agree on the goals and future policies around public governance in the 2020s. The participatory process of preparing the strategy has therefore played an important role in strengthening cooperation between the State, municipalities and future welfare regions, and the interaction between governance and the rest of society, as well as in building a common understanding of the need and direction of public governance development. </p><p>The implementation actions of the Strategy for Public Governance Renewal in 2021–22 included networking projects, events and development work that fostered the achievement of the goals set in the strategy and inspired dialogue between different actors, aiming to increase the knowledge base through studies and analyses, and competence renewal through education and training. While the centrally led implementation phase ended at the end of 2022, the implementation is continuing in all sectors and levels of government. </p><p>An external evaluation of the preparation, implementation and impacts of the strategy was launched in March 2023 and will be completed in spring 2024.</p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-111.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" />Climate and Environment Strategy for the ICT Sector</p><p>The Climate and Environment Strategy for the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Sector, Finland’s first strategy of this kind, was published on 9 March 2021. This pioneering strategy proposes instruments that will reduce the carbon and environmental footprint of the ICT sector, and help reap the benefits of digitalisation. More in general, the purpose of the national Climate and Environment Strategy for the ICT Sector is to promote ecologically sustainable digitalisation, and support the achievement of the climate and environment objectives. The strategy will be implemented by a wide range of parties, both public and private. The Ministry of Transport and Communications, and the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency (Traficom) monitor the implementation of the strategy in partnership with stakeholders. An annual forum is arranged to support this process.</p><p>As for the most recent developments in this context, Finland introduced legislation that promotes waste heat utilisation in data centres by providing a tax relief for those data centres that deliver their waste heat for utilisation. In addition, several research projects are going on in Finnish universities and research institutes. A project mapping the climate impacts of the digitalisation of public services and proposing methods to quantify these impacts was finalised in late 2022. Another project called MitViDi, running until the autumn of 2023, is developing green metrics for public digitalisation acquisitions. </p><p class="subtitle">Government Report: Digital Compass</p><p>A Digital Compass was drawn up for the purpose of directing and managing the digital transformation in Finland. It shows the way by creating a common roadmap for the development of digitalisation and the data economy. According to this vision, a digitally capable Finland is being built that is attractive, competitive, sustainable and prosperous. This goal will be achieved through competitive and innovative business activities, high-quality expertise, broad-based education, people-oriented public services, and safe and high-quality infrastructure. </p><p>As a background to the Digital Compass, a <a href="http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-952-383-906-9">government report</a> describes Finland’s challenges and opportunities for the development and utilisation of digitalisation and the data economy. </p><p class="subtitle">Open Government Action Plan </p><p>The IV <a href="https://avoinhallinto.fi/en/home/">Finnish Open Government Action Plan (2019–2023</a>) focuses on openness and inclusion in three different dimensions: (i) openness as a shared value; (ii) a strong legal foundation for openness; and (iii) the continuous development of openness. These three themes were translated into the following commitments for the implementation phase:</p><ul><li>Sustainable openness by pervading all government actions and development measures;</li><li>Implementation of the Open Government Strategy, which will determine the long-term direction and the objectives to be used as the basis for building future action plans;</li><li>Creation of a Transparency Register that will offer citizens information on the parties that seek to influence decision-making;</li><li>Commitment and measures on open data; and</li><li>Enhancement of the use and skills of dialogue in the public sector.</li></ul><p>The realisation of these commitments will be <a href="http://www.avoinhallinto.fi">monitored and evaluated</a> during the implementation of the plan and after its finalisation.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">Government Resolution for Opening up and Using Public Data </p><p>The strategic objectives of opening up and using public data concretise Finland’s national information policy with jointly agreed goals and measures. These strategic objectives guide and direct the actions of the different participants in opening up and using public data, ensuring they are all working towards the jointly agreed national goals. The objectives have been defined in collaboration between the bodies responsible for information policy, experts in the field and key stakeholders, in a transparent and inclusive way. The strategic objectives will be submitted for implementation to the various government entities concerned.</p><h2>Key Enablers</h2><h3>Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle">Act on the Openness of Government Activities </p><p>The Ministry of Justice will update the <a href="https://oikeusministerio.fi/en/act-on-the-openness-of-government-activities">Act on the Openness of Government Activities</a> according to the Government Programme to extend its application to data and information more broadly. The aim is a clearer and more viable legislation that will promote the transparency of society and meet the requirements of a modern society structure. </p><p>In January 2021, the Ministry of Justice set up a working group whose term extends to June 2023. The task of the working group is to assess and clarify the possible issues relating to the current legislation and provide solutions, as well as to analyse whether the scope of the current legislation is up to date and sufficient, particularly considering the changes in the structure of the administration.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle">Government Programme of Prime Minister Marin</p><p>As part of the Government Programme of Prime Minister Marin, Finland initiated a National Digital Identification Development Programme aiming to build a national solution for digital identification of Finnish citizens and foreigners using Finnish digital services. The solution in the national programme was built on the concepts of a State-issued core identity and self-sovereignty. This means that the core identity is under the control of the individual, and the issuer of the core identity cannot track where and how the individual uses the core identity. However, the development of this national solution was pushed back due to the Parliament’s schedule. There was not enough time to consider the legislative proposals on digital identity and redesign the personal identity code system during this parliamentary term. In any case, Finland is still committed to promoting reliable and functional solutions for managing a person’s electronic identity.</p><p>Finland welcomes the common legislative framework for European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallets, and continues active involvement in the revision of Regulation No. 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation) and in the development of a common technical architecture for EUDI wallets. In this context, in the period 2023–2025 Finland is taking part in three Digital Europe-funded piloting consortia (POTENTIAL, DC4EU and EWC), whose purpose is to pilot the cross-border use of EUDI wallets in various use cases.</p><h3>Security Aspects </h3><p class="subtitle">Government Resolution on Digital Security in the Public Sector</p><p>Published in April 2020, the <a href="https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/162265">Government Resolution on Digital Security in the Public Sector</a> defines the principles of development and key services for advancing security in the digital environment. It aims to protect citizens, communities and society from the risks and threats that may affect information, services and the functioning of society in the digital environment. </p><p>The government resolution and the Implementation Plan (<em>Haukka 2020–2023</em>) to advance its policies were prepared by an intersectoral coordination group set up by the <a href="https://vm.fi/en/frontpage">Ministry of Finance</a>. In the <a href="https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/162290">Implementation Plan</a>, 19 tasks related to the key digital services were selected on the basis of national and international assessments. These tasks include (i) a national and international collaboration model for digital security in the public sector; (ii) the management of digital security risks in the public sector; (iii) shared services advancing digital security intended for the municipalities; (iv) the development of competences of citizens and staff; (v) the assessment of digital security of services and service provision in the public sector; (vi) the protection of the digital infrastructure needed for the authorities’ processes and services; and (vii) the secure development of autonomous and adaptive systems and services in the public sector.</p><p class="subtitle">Cybersecurity Strategy </p><p>The Finnish government published the updated national <a href="https://www.defmin.fi/files/2378/Finland_s_Cyber_Security_Strategy.pdf">Cybersecurity Strategy</a> as a government resolution in October 2019. The strategy was prepared by the Security Committee of Finland, assisting the Finnish government and Ministries in comprehensive security matters. More in detail, the Committee monitors the Finnish security environment and the development of society, in addition to proactively coordinating the preparation of comprehensive security initiatives.</p><ul><li>The 2019 <a href="https://turvallisuuskomitea.fi/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Kyberturvallisuusstrategia_A4_ENG_WEB_031019.pdf">Cybersecurity Strategy</a> is based on the general principles of Finland’s 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy. The strategy and its implementation are also part of the implementation of the EU Cybersecurity Strategy. </li><li>The strategy defines key national objectives for the development of the cyberenvironment and the safeguarding of related vital functions. It focuses on three areas: (i) international cooperation; (ii) better coordination of cybersecurity management, planning and preparedness; and (iii) development of cybersecurity competence. </li><li>In 2021 the government adopted a Cybersecurity Development Programme. It is a concrete implementation plan on how to develop cybersecurity across sectors in the long term, covering the period 2021–2030. To that end, the programme deals with four themes: top-level competence, close collaboration, a strong domestic cybersecurity industry and effective national cybersecurity capabilities. In addition, in January 2023, the Ministry of Transport and Communications started the transposition into national law of the obligations of Directive (EU) 2022/2555 on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the Union (NIS 2 Directive). The Ministry will carry out the national implementation in a broad-based cooperation with other branches of government. </li></ul><h3>Interconnection of Base Registries</h3><p class="subtitle">Data Quality Framework<strong> </strong></p><p>The <a href="https://www.stat.fi/org/tilastokeskus/vuosiohjelma_en/data-quality-framework-project-increases-use-of-data.html">Data Quality Framework</a> is a tool for government agencies aimed to describe the quality of data in a uniform manner. It was created openly together with various stakeholders under the leadership of Statistics Finland. With the help of this model, government agencies will together produce more-easily-utilised and higher-quality data for public data resources, and extend the use of data for decision-making in society and by enterprises. The use of the Data Quality Framework will be supported by providing eTraining and networking activities for government agencies.</p><p>Public Administration API Principles</p><p>The <a href="https://www.avoindata.fi/en/api-principles">Public Administration Application Programming Interface (API) Principles</a> promote the provision and use of public sector information and functionalities primarily through APIs.

The government adopted a decision in principle on the National Public Procurement Strategy the following day.</p><p>The strategy contains eight strategic common goals and 25 objectives implementing them. The strategic development focuses on strategic management and the promotion of procurement skills, with information management and impact assessment supporting strategic management. At the heart of the development work is the acquisition of functional and high-quality products and services so that all parties are involved in the process, the market is vibrant and innovation can be generated as part of public procurement. Through the development of these elements, public procurement can achieve economic, social and ecological sustainability. </p><p>As of spring 2022, the strategy was progressing according to plan. Nearly 30 measures had been completed or were in progress, including measures to promote green and low-carbon procurement, information management and digitisation, innovative public procurement, employment through procurement, procurement expertise, and the role of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and human rights in procurement processes. </p><p>Overall, around 500 public and municipal procurement professionals, representatives of tender companies, researchers and representatives of various expert organisations are actively participating in the eight thematic groups focused around the eight strategic common goals. The thematic groups are open to all and the number of participants representing the different stakeholders is increasing steadily.</p><h2>Domain-specific Political Communications</h2><p>Government Resolution on Digital Logistics</p><p>In its Resolution on Digital Logistics, the Finnish government outlined measures aimed at a more efficient, safer and climate-friendly transport. In particular, the measures aim to make more efficient use of information in transport chains and hubs. To that end, a key priority in the digitisation of logistics is to develop the existing national information environment as part of the EU-wide data space development in the transport sector. In this context, electronic consignment notes will guide logistics operators to move toward digital data exchange. In addition, as a key measure Finland appointed a Logistics Digitisation Forum to ensure data sharing in supply chains. The members represent the logistics and transport services and digital solutions sectors, other key sectors in industry, commerce and other service branches, as well as Ministries and authorities.</p><p class="subtitle">National Transport System Plan for 2021–2032</p><p>The <a href="http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-952-383-804-8">National Transport System Plan for 2021–2032</a> is a strategic plan for developing the transport system.

The report explains what kind of spatial information is needed in society as well as how to develop, manage and distribute it, while promoting its use. The aim of the report is to compel all actors in the public sector to see to the interoperability of spatial data and access it in a way that it can be used by public authorities and companies as efficiently as possible, while ensuring a high standard of information security and personal data protection. One of the recent implementation actions of the report is a new national address database project. </p><p>GeoForum Finland is a new association established in 2020 that enables to reap the growing benefits of location intelligence in society. The association and its network develop cooperation between the geospatial industry and organisations using spatial data, companies, public administration, and educational and research institutions.</p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle">Artificial Intelligence 4.0 Programme (2020–2023)</p><p>In 2020, the Minister of Economic Affairs, Mika Lintilä, appointed a steering group to prepare an action plan for Finland to speed up the introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) and to promote the fourth industrial revolution. At the time of its launch, the programme was named <a href="https://tem.fi/en/artificial-intelligence-4.0-programme">Artificial Intelligence 4.0</a>. The objective of the Artificial Intelligence 4.0 Programme is to ensure that in 2030 the assets of the Finnish industry are sustainability, capacity for renewal, technological leadership and solutions that enable to increase the carbon handprint. To that end, the aim is to promote digital investments that increase productivity and sustainability, to diversify the manufacturing industry and service ecosystems through new value creation and partnerships, and to advance Finland’s goals in actions aiming to strengthen Europe’s open strategic autonomy. </p><p>The steering group published an interim report in December 2021 in which it identified five challenge areas. The group suggested a vision ‘to make Finland a winner in the twin transition’, i.e. a simultaneous digital and green transition. In its <a href="https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/164468/TEM_2022_63.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">final report</a> in December 2022 the steering group confirmed the vision and identified three areas for development: i) strengthening high-level research on key technologies, as well as development activities and investments; ii) increasing the adoption of digital capabilities and technologies that accelerate the dual transition in industrial SMEs; and iii) making Finland an international frontrunner in the twin transition. An action plan with 11 measures accompanied by monitoring indicators was drafted. In addition, the steering group proposed the creation of a roundtable of all stakeholders, which would be responsible for advancing the action plan on a strategic level after the end of programme.</p><p class="subtitle">National Artificial Intelligence Programme AuroraAI</p><p>The <a href="https://vm.fi/en/national-artificial-intelligence-programme-auroraai">AuroraAI Programme</a> was based on the aim in Prime Minister Marin’s Government Programme to continue developing the AuroraAI network with a view to promoting smoothly running daily life and business in a secure and ethically sustainable manner. The project term was from 31 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. The objective of the programme was to speed up the development of public administration and the provision of public services in an AI-assisted manner that is centred on people and life events. At the same time, it contributed to the organisation of public services in a people-oriented manner, which is one of the objectives of the <a href="https://publicgovernancestrategy.fi/">Strategy for Public Governance</a>.</p><p>The AuroraAI network is a technical solution that makes use of AI to enable organisations to implement their clients’ service counselling as a digital self-service. It offers an interface service that an organisation can connect to the background of its own digital service. The AuroraAI network consists of the <a href="https://palveluhallinta.suomi.fi/en/sivut/auroraai/esittely">core components</a> and the services connected to the network. With the core components, such as the recommendation engine and the AuroraAPI interface, services connected to the AuroraAI network can interact with each other. The Digital and Population Data Services Agency was responsible for implementing the core components.</p><p>In addition to technological development, the programme involved network cooperation, the elaboration of new operating models for public organisations, and the development of new skills and competence, particularly in public organisations. The objective of developing the AuroraAI operating model was to establish, together with partner organisations, sample implementations and tools for the development of human-centric and life-event-oriented activities. The operating model integrates the developed tools and lessons learned, and creates a framework of issues to be taken into account in the transition to more human-centric and AI‑assisted activities.</p><h3>Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Big Data</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud Computing </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT) </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing</h3><p>Involvement in High-performance Computing</p><p>Finland signed the European High-Performance Computing (EuroHPC) Declaration in 2018.

In addition, a new chapter in the Act on Information Management in Public Administration (906/2019) determines the procedures a public authority must follow when developing and implementing automated decision-making. In general, the new regulation limits the use of autonomous technologies like AI in automated decision-making; the decision-making must be based on rules defined ahead of time by natural persons and does not allow for the use of systems that modify their own behaviour. </p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle">Act on Information Management in Public Administration </p><p>The <a href="https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190906">Act on Information Management in Public Administration </a>(906/2019) includes a requirement for government agencies to utilise datasets of other government agencies whenever possible, if they by law have access to such data via electronic interfaces. Regular exchange of data between agencies has also to be organised via electronic interfaces. The act also prescribes that the general governance of the interoperability of the shared information pools of public administration is the task of the Ministry of Finance.

In order to do so, Your Europe offers information on basic rights under EU law, but also on how these rights are implemented in each individual country (where information has been provided by the national authorities). Free email or telephone contact with EU assistance services, to get more personalised or detailed help and advice is also available.</p><p>Please note that, in most cases, the EU rights described in Your Europe apply to all EU member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and sometimes to Switzerland.
