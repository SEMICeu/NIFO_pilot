The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-74.jpeg" alt="35-74.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the average result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise within the 27 Member States in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-86.jpeg" alt="35-86.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF principles for the 27 Member States with multiple principles scoring at 4. Areas of improvement are concentrated in the Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility), 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency), for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of the corresponding recommendations. </p><p>Principle 1 requires European countries’ decision-making processes to follow the objectives of <strong>subsidiarity and proportionality. </strong>This principle is assessed through Recommendation 1, which states that European countries should “ensure that national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies are aligned with the EIF and, if needed, tailor and extend them to address the national context and needs”. The result of 3 for Recommendation 1 and consequently for Principle 1, at European level, shows a partial implementation of EIF recommendations in existing or ongoing NIFs and policies. The analysis of the results revealed that the number of countries reporting a high level of alignment of their NIFs and strategies with the EIF increased from 14 in 2019 to 16 in 2020. </p><p>Principle 7 calls for <strong>inclusion and accessibility</strong> throughout the development cycle of a European public service in terms of design, information, content and delivery. This principle should be taken into account in order to ensure that all citizens have access to European public services and that they can take full advantage of the opportunities offered by new technologies to access and use these services. This principle is assessed through Recommendation 14 assessing the countries’ compliance with the European accessibility standards of the Directive (EU) 2016/2102 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies. When analysing the overall European countries’ performance in implementing Recommendation 14, the results revealed a partial implementation of the accessibility standards set forth by the Directive (EU) 2016/2102 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public-sector bodies. </p><p>Principle 9 promotes <strong>multilingualism </strong>when designing<strong> </strong>European public services to make them accessible and usable by anyone that may need them, therefore the underlying Recommendation 16 calls for European countries to “use information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service and decide on the level of multilingualism support based on the needs of the expected users”. The implementation score for this recommendation is computed by assessing the extent to which users of each of the 21 proposed procedures across the 7 life events (i.e. Birth, Residence, Studying, etc.) of the Single Digital Gateway Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2018/1724) can access instructions for completing the procedure in an official EU language that is widely understood by the largest possible number of cross-border users. The results of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism with regard to multilingualism showed a heterogeneous implementation of the principle. For instance, the possibility of accessing instructions for completing the procedures in an official EU language is not always ensured in the European countries, especially for procedures related to moving. Nevertheless, the median results increased in 2020 compared to 2019 for a large number of administrative procedures, such as procedures for requesting proof of residence, submitting an initial application for admission to public tertiary education institution, or registering a change of address.</p><p>Principle 12 assesses the extent to which nine key elements, i.e. return on investments, total cost of ownership, reusability, adaptability, risks, administrative burden, simplification of administrative processes, user satisfaction and user-centricity, are taken into account in the evaluation of the <strong>effectiveness and efficiency</strong> of a European public service.  The principle is evaluated through Recommendation 19 which states that European public administrations should “evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits”. Overall, the results at the European level for Recommendation 19, and thus for Principle 12, indicated a partial implementation with an average score of three. In particular, the results showed that return on investment and adaptability are the least considered when assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of public services, while simplification of administrative processes and reusability are more commonly taken into account across Europe. Compared to 2019, the results obtained for this recommendation showed that the consideration of seven of the nine key elements has increased among European countries: return on investments, total cost of ownership, reusability, adaptability, risks, user satisfaction and user-centricity.  </p><p><img src="img/35-90.jpeg" alt="35-90.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2, the 27 Member States show on average a very good performance in implementing all layers with the score of 4. However, potential areas of improvement to reinforce the European Union’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance to ensure a full implementation of all recommendations associated with this area. </p><p>The implementation of the <strong>interoperability governance</strong> layer is evaluated through recommendations 20 to 24, which address two aspects: the implementation of holistic governance for interoperability activities across administrative levels and sectors, the identification and selection of common standards and specifications to facilitate interoperability. With respect to the interoperability governance layer, there have been significant improvements mainly regarding the implementation of a holistic governance across all administrative levels and sectors, and the implementation of defined processes for the selection and adoption of standards and specifications. More specifically, almost all European countries now provide interoperability governance with a holistic approach across all administrative levels and sectors, with the exception of three countries that are still in the process of doing so and have a dedicated budget for 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-93.jpeg" alt="35-93.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The average scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 of the 27 Member States show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model, internal and external information sources and services, base registries and open data. However, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to catalogues, external information sources and services as well as in the area of security and privacy. </p><p><strong>Catalogues</strong> are a key component of the conceptual model for integrated public services and aim at supporting the easy access to reusable resources (e.g. services, data, software). A variety of catalogues exist ranging from directories of services, to libraries of software components and metadata catalogues. The description of the content provided is equally important to the resources it contains as it enables interoperability in-between different catalogues. The implementation of interoperable catalogues is evaluated through Recommendation 44 of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism calling on European countries to “put in place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions and use common models for describing them”. The assessment of this recommendation takes into account nine main types of catalogues that European public bodies should have at their disposal to design integrated and interoperable public services, i.e. catalogues of public data, directories of services, libraries of software components, open data portals, registries of base registries, metadata catalogues, catalogues of standards, catalogues of specifications and catalogues of guidelines. The results, at European level, for this particular indicator outlined a partial implementation of these key catalogues within public administrations. Indeed, while open data portals and catalogues of public data are used in a vast majority of European countries, it appears that other types of catalogues, such as libraries of software components and catalogues of specifications and guidelines are yet to be implemented uniformly across Europe.</p><p>The EIF fosters the <strong>use of external information sources and services</strong> by European public administrations in the design of interoperable public services. Indeed, public administrations need to leverage services provided by third parties outside their organisational boundaries, such as payment services provided by financial institutions or connectivity services provided by telecommunications providers. They also need to tap into external information sources such as open data and data from international organizations, chambers of commerce, etc. The use of external information sources and services is assessed through Recommendation 45 calling on European public administrations to “use external information sources and services while developing European public services, where useful and feasible to do so” measured by the extent to which public administrations are using external information sources and services while developing public services.The 2020 results of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism revealed that European countries insufficiently rely on external sources and services for the development of their public services. On the one hand, it appears that the use of Internet of Things sources (e.g. sensors) and social web applications is quite low across Europe, despite an increased adoption compared to 2019. On the other hand, the use of payment services provided by financial institutions or other actors, connectivity services provided by telecommunications providers, open data, data from other organisations (e.g. international organisations, chambers of commerce, etc...), eID and eSignature are much more widespread among European public administrations.</p><p>The principle of <strong>security and privacy</strong> is a crucial element to embed by design in the development of interoperable public services. Public services should follow the privacy-by-design and security-by-design approach to secure their complete infrastructure and should be compliant with the legal requirements regarding data protection and privacy. The EIF therefore calls on European countries to “consider the specific security and privacy requirements and identify measures for the provision of each public service according to risk management plans” (Recommendation 46) and “use trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services” (Recommendation 47). The implementation of this recommendation is assessed through the application of privacy and security elements and measures (e.g. risk management and business continuity plans and eArchive) and the number of trust services providers by country. The score for security and privacy at the European level, showed an overall good implementation of Recommendation 46 within national frameworks, with an increase in the implementation of all privacy and security elements and measures, but with the exception of risk management. However, the scores for Recommendation 47 are heterogeneous, as the number of trust service providers present on national trusted lists complying with the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">eIDAS Regulation</a> varies across countries and remains insufficient in some of them. </p><p>An in-depth analysis of the European results in the 2020 edition of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available within second chapter of the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/news/state-play-report-2021-now-live">State of Play report on digital public administration and interoperability in Europe</a>.

The strategy was developed after identifying the three goals for the transformation of European industry, supporting SMEs and keeping Europe sustainable and competitive, as follows: </p><ul><li>A globally competitive and world-leading industry </li><li>An industry that paves the way to climate-neutrality </li><li>An industry shaping Europe’s digital future</li></ul><p>In order to reach these goals, the strategy outlines a nine-pronged approach, as follows: </p><ul><li>Creating certainty for industry through a deeper and more digital single market;</li><li>Upholding a global level playing field;</li><li>Supporting industry towards climate neutrality;</li><li>Building a more circular economy;</li><li>Embedding a spirit of industrial innovation; </li><li>Skilling and reskilling;</li><li>Investing and financing the transition; </li><li>Reinforcing Europe’s industrial and strategic autonomy;</li><li>A partnership approach to governance.</li></ul><p>This strategy has been designed so as to react to the technological and climate-related changes that industries throughout the European Union are facing. It is hoped that measures make Europe more competitive and enhance strategy autonomy through a shared commitment from the European Union, the Member States and regions, industry and SMEs. </p><p>On 5 May 2021, the Commission adopted the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_1884">update on the 2020 Industrial Strategy</a>. The updated strategy took into account the experiences of the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on the Single Market, taking into account aspects such as dependencies in key strategic areas and looking to drive the digital transformation in a more sustainable, digital, resilient and globally competitive economy. </p><p class="subtitle">ICT Standardisation Priorities for the Digital Single Market</p><p>The Commission adopted on 19 April 2016 a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/news-redirect/30496">Communication setting up ICT standardisation priorities for the Digital Single Market</a> as part of the package on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/digitising-european-industry">Digitising European Industry</a>. The initiative aimed to re-energise the standard-setting system in Europe as a step towards industrial global leadership and digital innovation. The results of this plan were intended to ensure that European standards would be in place quickly enough to allow future devices to connect smoothly across the Digital Single Market.</p><p>The Commission identified the following priority areas: 5G communications, cloud computing, the internet of things (IoT), (big) data technologies and cybersecurity. These are the essential technology building blocks of the Digital Single Market. A regular review of the priorities was planned so as to respond to changes in technology and society.</p><p>Certain aspects of this priority plan also complemented and developed specific public sector requirements identified in the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:2c2f2554-0faf-11e7-8a35-01aa75ed71a1.0017.02/DOC_2&amp;format=PDF">revised</a> version of the European Interoperability Framework for European Public Services, taking on board the standardisation needs of the European public administrations.</p><p>In August 2021 was also closed the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13099-Standardisation-strategy_en">public consultation</a> for the future standardisation strategy, aimed at collecting feedback on the current strategy, address the challenges faced in the European standardisation system and discuss on ways to improve it.  </p><p>Furthermore, as part of the eGovernment Action Plan, a catalogue of services for ICT procurement was put together. The European Catalogue will contribute to making procured solutions more interoperable and towards creating a more transparent public procurement market. The catalogue will serve as a one-stop-shop for procurement guidelines, including on vendor lock-in, on the use of standards, and a lifecycle costing scheme.</p><p>In 2021, the European Commission released the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/content/2021-rolling-plan-ict-standardisation-released_en">Rolling Plan for ICT Standardisation 2021</a>, which includes new chapters such as ‘COVID-19’, ‘Safety, transparency and due process online’, ‘Circular economy’ and ‘U-space’. Particularly within the COVID-19 chapter, the requested actions in support of the recovery of Europe now take into consideration permanent and structural changes in our societal and economic life and address issues such as teleworking, eLearning, eCommerce, eGovernment and the potential  development of a universally accepted eID which will allow for simpler, more trusted and securer access to cross-border digital public services.</p><p class="subtitle">Open-Source Strategy 2020-2023</p><p>The new <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/departments/informatics/open-source-software-strategy_en">Open Source Software strategy</a> of the European Commission approved on 21 October 2020 aims to encourage the development of open, secure, private and accessible software solutions.

The White Paper outlines the European Commission’s proposed approach to the regulation of artificial intelligence, with the aim of promoting Europe’s capacity to innovate in this field while simultaneously supporting the development and uptake of ethical and trustworthy artificial intelligence throughout the European Union. The White Paper proposes the following: </p><ul><li>Outlining measures that will help to streamline research, increase financial investment into the development and deployment of artificial intelligence, and foster collaboration in this field between Member States. </li><li>Strategizing potential policy options for a future EU regulatory framework determining the types of legal requirements that would apply to relevant actors. </li></ul><p>There is a key focus on a risk-based approach, with the European Union arguing that regulatory requirements should be deemed as mandatory when dealing with “high-risk” applications, such as healthcare. </p><p>Additionally, the White Paper outlines proposed procedures for testing and certifying artificial intelligence applications, in order to ensure compliance with any new regulatory framework that is developed. </p><p>On 21 April 2021, the Commission’s communication on <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/communication-fostering-european-approach-artificial-intelligence">Fostering a European approach to Artificial Intelligence</a> offered a proposal for a regulatory framework and a revised coordinated plan, which aim to promote the development and address the potential risks of AI. </p><p class="subtitle">Proposal for a policy communication on a Drone Strategy 2.0 for Europe</p><p>As announced in the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52020DC0789">Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy</a>, the Commission plans to adopt a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/13046-A-Drone-Strategy-20-for-Europe_en">Drone Strategy 2.0</a> in 2022. The strategy aims to provide a comprehensive policy package and address obstacles to the development of new drone applications and transport services and to the competitiveness of this industry. It will also foster the uptake of this innovative technology in Europe while establishing the right balance between safety, security and other societal concerns, contributing to a new offer of sustainable services and transport. </p><p>The take-up of drones is affecting a growing number of sectors, such as agriculture, construction, surveillance, filming, healthcare, energy, environment, public safety and security, with future visions including the use of drones as platforms for communication hubs or weather or pollution monitoring. To encourage investment and development of new innovative services for different sectors, the establishment of a harmonised EU approach should be ensured for increased cooperation between stakeholders, identification of regulatory gaps and support of technical harmonisation and research.</p><ul><li><img src="img/35-147.jpeg" alt="35-147.jpeg" /></li></ul><p>	 Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><p>4</p><h1><a id="_Toc44407848"></a>Legislative Instruments for Digital Public Administration in the European Union</h1><h2>Legislation on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Regulation (EU) 2021/694 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2021 establishing the Digital Europe Programme </p><p>As part of the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/the-eu-budget/long-term-eu-budget-2021-2027/#:~:text=The multiannual financial framework (MFF,the period of 2021-2027.&amp;text=The MFF covers the following,and values: â¬377.8 billion">Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027</a>, the European Commission decided to set up a new funding programme, the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/digital-europe-programme-proposed-eu75-billion-funding-2021-2027">Digital Europe Programme</a>, whose goal is to boost Europe’s digital transformation and to further develop the digital single market and promote the uptake of digital technologies in both the public and private sectors.</p><p>The funding programme is to provide EUR 7.5 billion to be invested in specific domains such as supercomputing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, advanced digital skills and ensuring a wide use of digital capacity across the economy and society.</p><p>The Regulation establishing the Digital Europe Programme was published on 11 May 2021, entered into force the same date and has applied retroactively since 1 January 2021.</p><p class="subtitle">Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (Digital Markets Act)</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the increasing importance of digital platforms in our social and economic everyday lives.

Thanks to eIDAS, the EU now has a predictable legal framework providing legal certainty beyond national borders for electronic identification (eID) and for electronic trust services (such as electronic signatures, seals, time stamping, delivery services and website authentication).</p><p>In this regard, the eIDAS Regulation: </p><ul><li>Ensured that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification schemes (eIDs) to access public services in other EU countries where eIDs are available.</li><li>Created a European internal market for trust services by ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as traditional paper-based processes. </li></ul><p>With the eIDAS Regulation, the relevant implementing acts, and including standards as well as a technical interoperability infrastructure, which was rolled out under the Connecting Europe Facility, the EU became the first and only region in the world having a holistic, workable and balanced legal framework for cross-border use of electronic identification and trust services. </p><p>The eIDAS Regulation entered into force on 17 September 2014. It laid down specific application dates for the following:</p><ul><li>Rules on trust services (electronic signatures, seals, time stamps, electronic registered delivery services and website authentication) were directly applicable to all EU Member States since 1 July 2016.</li><li>While all Member States were required to recognise other Member States' notified eID means as of 29 September 2018, the voluntary recognition of eIDs has been allowed since 29 September 2015, following the adoption of relevant implementing acts. This meant that an EU Member State may, on a voluntary basis, notify and recognise national eID means that citizens and companies could use across borders to access online public services. To date (and the information is continuously updated), 25 Member States have national eID means in place, whether eID cards or other means.</li></ul><p>To this end, Member States have been working on setting up their national eIDAS nodes with help from the Connecting Europe Facility Programme of the Commission, i.e. the required infrastructure for the eID cross-border connection, and all are expected to be ready by the required deadline.</p><p>The European Commission, through its ‘Shaping Europe Digital Future’ communication aims at reviewing this Regulation and improve its effectiveness by extending its application to the private sector. </p><p>This initiative is built on the inception impact assessment conducted by the Commission on the eIDAS Regulation, which concluded that that potential of electronic identification and authentication under the current eIDAS remains underexploited. </p><p>At the end of 2020, the European Council asked the Commission to introduce an EU-wide digital ID system so as to secure users’ identification in both the private and public spheres. On 3 June 2021 the Commission proposed the framework for a <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0281">European Digital Identity</a>. Under the new regulation, Member States will issue European Digital Identity Wallets that will enable users to access services online without using private identification methods or share unnecessary data. The proposal is accompanied by a Recommendation inviting Member States to cooperate within the framework to develop a digital toolbox. This toolbox should include a comprehensive technical architecture and reference framework, a set of common standards and technical references and a set of guidelines and descriptions of best practices covering at least all aspects of the functionalities and interoperability of the European Digital Identity Wallets. </p><h3>Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle">Review of the Directive on Security of Networks and Information Systems (NIS2)</p><p>In December 2020, the Commission adopted the proposal for the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal-directive-measures-high-common-level-cybersecurity-across-union">revision of the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems</a> (NIS 2 Directive). </p><p>Despite the notable achievements of the NIS Directive, the digital transformation of our societies and economies, further boosted by the COVID-19 crisis, has identified new challenges and limitations in the current Directive, requiring tailored responses. </p><p>Indeed, the Commission proposal expands the scope of the current NIS Directive, aiming to reinforce the security requirements appointed, focusing on the security of supply chains, simplifying reporting obligations, introducing tougher supervisory measures and stricter enforcement requirements including harmonised sanctions across Member States. The proposal also includes a suggestion for information sharing and cooperation on cyber crisis management at national and at EU level. </p><p>The proposal is currently being discussed and negotiated between the co-legislators (the Council and the European Parliament). </p><p class="subtitle">Directive (EU) 2016/1148 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2016 Concerning Measures for a High Common Level of Security of Network and Information Systems Across the Union</p><p><a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148&amp;qid=1482413313776&amp;from=en">The Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems</a> (the NIS Directive) was adopted by the European Parliament on 6 July 2016 and entered into force in August 2016. Member States were given 21 months to transpose the Directive and six months more to identify operators of essential services. </p><p>The Directive ensured Member States’ preparedness for cyber threats by requiring them to be appropriately equipped. They were required to establish a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) Network, in order to promote swift and effective operational cooperation on specific cybersecurity incidents and sharing information about risks. A culture of security across sectors was considered vital for the economy and society which relied heavily on ICT, such as energy, transport, water, banking, financial market infrastructures, healthcare and digital infrastructure. </p><p>In 2017, the Commission put forward a <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/initiatives/ares-2017-4460501_en">draft Implementing Regulation Pursuant Art 16(8) of the NIS Directive</a>. This Regulation specified further the elements to be considered by digital service providers when identifying and taking measures to ensure a level of security of network and information systems, which they use in the context of offering services referred to in Annex III to Directive (EU) 2016/1148. It also specified further the parameters to be considered to determine whether an incident has a substantial impact on the provision of those services.</p><p class="subtitle">Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC</p><p>In January 2012, the European Commission proposed a comprehensive reform of data protection rules in the EU.

Member States had two years to adapt their national laws to introduce the first set of provisions in the Directive, including a new obligation on business registers to make available documentation submitted by limited liability companies within 21 days of receipt. Ensuring that information about companies was always up to date was one of the main objectives of this Directive. Business registers were required to make available information on the rules in their national law, according to which third parties could rely on certain company documents. This information was also available on the <a href="https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_business_registers_in_member_states-106-en.do?clang=en">eJustice portal</a>.</p><p>The Directive also required a Business Registers Interconnection System (BRIS) to be established.

Member States had to transpose the remaining rules and make the necessary preparations for connecting to the new system by 8 June 2017. BRIS made it easy to access information on EU companies via the <a href="https://e-justice.europa.eu/home.do">eJustice</a> or other national portals. In addition, it facilitated electronic communication between registers in relation to cross-border mergers and branches of companies registered in other Member States.</p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on Public Procurement and Repealing Directive 2004/18/EC </p><p>The <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.094.01.0065.01.ENG">Directive</a>, which took effect on 26 February 2014, set out the legal framework for public procurement, including electronic procurement. It established the procedures which must be followed before awarding a contract to suppliers (i.e. providers of works, supplies or services) when its value exceeded set thresholds, unless it qualified for a specific exclusion - e.g. on grounds of national security. The EU Member States were required to transpose the Directive into national law by 18 April 2016. </p><p>The Directive introduced a set of new rules, including a new electronic self-declaration for bidders (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/e-procurement/espd_en">ESPD</a>), which paved the way for the digitisation of public procurement, which considerably increased the efficiency of the public procurement system. For instance, only the winning company needed to submit all the documentation proving that it qualified for a contract, drastically reducing the volume of essential documents.</p><p class="subtitle">Directive 2014/55/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on Electronic Invoicing in Public Procurement </p><p>EU countries and the European Commission decided to introduce a European Standard for eInvoicing in response to the many eInvoice formats used across the EU. Once the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32014L0055">eInvoicing Directive 2014/55/EU</a> was transposed into the national laws of EU countries, the deadline for implementing the norm has passed, and electronic invoices are able to flow seamlessly across the EU. </p><p class="subtitle">Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/1780 of 23 September 2019 establishing standard forms for the publication of notices in the field of public procurement </p><p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2019/1780/oj">Regulation</a> of 23 September 2019 establishes the use of eForms with common standard and terminology by public buyers to publish notices on <a href="https://ted.europa.eu/TED/browse/browseByMap.do">Tenders Electronic Daily</a> - an online portal for public procurement notices from across the EU. The adoption of eForms represents the core of the digital transformation of public procurement in the EU, helping reduce the administrative burden for buyers, increasing the ability of governments to make data-driven decisions about public spending, and making public procurement more transparent.</p><h2>Accessibility</h2><p class="subtitle">Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2 December 2016 on the Accessibility of Websites and Mobile Applications of Public Sector Bodies</p><p>The objectives of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/web-accessibility">Web Accessibility Directive</a> were two-fold; firstly, the directive aimed to ensure equal access to public sector information and services for people with disabilities, and secondly, the harmonisation of approaches to accessibility reduced technical barriers on the digital single market. </p><p>In accordance with the directive, a new website by a public sector body had to be published in an accessible format by September 2019. Already, existing websites must be made accessible by September 2020, and mobile applications must be accessible by June 2021.</p><p>In addition, Member States must appoint a national body in charge of periodically monitoring the compliance with the provisions of the directive, and to report the outcome of such monitoring to the Commission.</p><h2>Emerging technologies </h2><p class="subtitle">Proposal for a Regulation on a European approach for Artificial Intelligence </p><p>There has been a recent realisation of the strong potential benefits that Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems can have on European economic growth as well as on its innovation and global competitiveness.

The Facility is to make EUR 723.8 billion available to the Member States, through loans and grants that will support reforms and investments in the countries. The overall aim is to help the countries mitigate the economic and social impact of the crisis and make European economies and societies more sustainable, resilient and better prepared for future challenges. </p><p>In order to benefit from the support of the Facility, Member States recently submitted their Recovery and Resilience Plans for approval to the European Commission. These Plans set out a package of reforms and public investment projects that the Member States will need to implement by 2026 in order to benefit from the support (and funding) of the Facility.</p><p>The Commission will assess the recovery and resilience plans based on criteria set out in the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32021R0241">Regulation</a> establishing the Recovery and Resilience Facility. The assessments will notably consider whether the following terms are respected:</p><ul><li>Represent a balanced response to the economic and social situation of the Member State, contributing appropriately to all six Facility pillars (namely, green transition; digital transformation; economic cohesion, productivity and competitiveness; social and territorial cohesion; health, economic, social and institutional resilience; policies for the next generation);</li><li>Contribute to effectively addressing the relevant country-specific recommendations;</li><li>Follow the expenditure rules of the “twin transitions”: green and digital</li><li>By devoting at least 37% of total expenditure on investments and reforms that support climate objectives;</li><li>Devoting at least 20% of total expenditure on the digital transition;</li><li>Contribute to strengthening the growth potential, job creation and economic, institutional and social resilience of the Member State; </li><li>Do not significantly harm the environment.</li></ul><h2>InvestEU </h2><p>The <a href="https://europa.eu/investeu/about-investeu_en">InvestEU programme</a> builds on the successes of the Investment Plan for Europe, in order to give an additional boost to sustainable investment, innovation and job creation in Europe, always in line with EU policies and will contribute to the EU’s economic recovery. </p><p>The programme will be structured around four policy areas: </p><ul><li>Sustainable infrastructure</li><li>Research, innovation and digitalisation</li><li>SMEs</li><li>Social investment and skills </li></ul><h2>REACT-EU</h2><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/newsroom/coronavirus-response/react-eu">Recovery assistance for cohesion and the territories of Europe</a> (REACT-EU) is a top-up to the 2014-2020 European Regional Development Fund and European Social Fund allocations, as a crisis-response and crisis-repair measure and constitutes a bridge to the long-term recovery plan. </p><p>Hence, the overall budget of EUR 50.6 billion will be allocated to projects that foster crisis repair capacities in the context of the coronavirus crisis, as well as investments in operations contributing to the preparing a green, digital and resilient recovery of the economy. </p><p>The allocation of funds takes into consideration the economic and social impact of the crisis on EU countries, reflecting their GDP drops and rise of unemployment, particularly among you people, as well as the countries’ wealth. </p><h2>Digital Europe Programme (DEP)</h2><p>As part of the new Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2021-2027, the European Commission has proposed a new funding programme: the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/digital-europe-programme-proposed-eu92-billion-funding-2021-2027">Digital Europe Programme</a> (DIGITAL), whose goal will be to set up the strategic digital capacities of the EU and to promote a far-reaching deployment of new technologies, to be used by the EU’s citizens and businesses. With an overall budget of EUR 7.5 billion for the period 2021-2027, the Digital Europe Programme aims to define and bolster the digital transformation of Europe’s society and economy. </p><p>The programme will heavily focus on investing and boosting Europe’s use of emerging technologies such as supercomputing, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and blockchain, among others. In addition, it will boost investments in cybersecurity and advanced digital skills so as to improve Europe’s competitiveness in the global digital economy and increase its technological autonomy. </p><p>The programme’s budget has been subdivided according to the following areas:</p><ul><li>EUR 2.2 billion will be allocated to <strong>supercomputing</strong> in order to build up and strengthen the EU’s supercomputing and data processing capabilities. The aim is also to increase accessibility and broaden the use of supercomputing to areas of public interest such as health, environment and security. </li><li>EUR 2.1 billion will be allocated to <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> so as to allow businesses and public administrations to further invest in and open up the use of artificial intelligence. </li><li>EUR 1.7 billion will be allocated to <strong>cybersecurity</strong> in order to strengthen cybersecurity policies and coordination between Member States. </li><li>EUR 580 million will be allocated for <strong>advanced digital skills</strong> in order to support the design and delivery of specialised programmes and traineeships in key capacity areas.</li><li>EUR 1.1 billion will be allocated for <strong>ensuring the wide use of digital technologies across the economy and society</strong> by supporting high impact deployments in areas of public interest such as health for examples, and by supporting European public administrations and businesses to deploy and access emerging technologies such as blockchain and foster their trust in the digital transformation, among others. </li></ul><p>The interoperability budget will partially be used to finance the European Digital Government Eco System (EDGES) whose goal is to foster the digital transformation and interoperability of public administrations in order to increase the efficiency and accessibility of services delivery. More specifically, the budget will be allocated to three focus areas: the creation of the Common Services Platform, Interoperability and GovTech as well as the implementation of the Once-Only principle.</p><h2>The Connecting Europe Facility 2021-2027</h2><p>As part of the next long-term EU budget (MFF 2021-2027), the European Commission proposed to renew the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32013R1316">Connecting Europe Facility</a> (CEF), the funding programme supporting the development of transport, energy and digital infrastructure within trans-European networks. The Council and the European Parliament decided to allocate an overall budget of EUR 33.71 billion to better integrate the transport, energy and digital sectors, and to help achieve EU climate objectives, while at the same time fostering job creation, economy growth and the deployment of emerging technologies. </p><p>The CEF Transport part of the programme, with an overall of budget of EUR 22.9 billion (the highest amount among the three pillars of CEF 2), will strongly promote the shift to decarbonisation and will work towards making transport connected, sustainable, inclusive, safe and secure. Priority will also be given to further develop the trans-European transport networks (TEN-T), with a particular focus on missing links and cross-border projects. </p><p>The energy sector of the programme, with a dedicated budget of EUR 5.2 billion, will contribute to transitioning towards clean energy and complete the Energy Union, by further integrating the European energy market, improving the interoperability of energy networks across sectors and borders, fostering decarbonisation and ensuring security of supply. </p><p>The digital of envelope, of EUR 1.8 billion, will aim at improving digital connectivity through the creation of very high-capacity broadband networks as a basis for better digital services. </p><h2>Horizon Europe</h2><p>As a continuation of Horizon 2020, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/funding-programmes-and-open-calls/horizon-europe_en">Horizon Europe</a> is the EU’s main funding programme for research and innovation, with an overall budget of EUR 95.5 billion.

The European Catalogue will help ensure that procured solutions are interoperable and increase the transparency of the ICT procurement market. The Catalogue will offer a one-stop-shop for procurement guidelines, including vendor lock-in, the use of standards, and a lifecycle costing scheme that accounts for the often-neglected interoperability costs.</p><p>At present, the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/ict-standards-procurement/catalogue">Catalogue</a> is a draft version to demonstrate the concepts. The prototype proposes procurement needs in four domains: cloud computing, transport systems, eGovernment, and smart and efficient use of energy. </p><p>In February 2017, the European Commission launched an open public consultation to improve the draft contents of the Catalogue by gathering feedback on the contents and taking suggestions for possible improvements to the catalogue structure.</p><h2>ISA² Core Vocabularies</h2><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/core-vocabularies_en">Core Vocabularies</a> are simplified, reusable, and extensible data models that capture the fundamental characteristics of an entity, such as a person or a public organisation, in a context-neutral manner.</p><p>Public administrations can use and extend the Core Vocabularies in the following contexts:</p><ul><li>Information exchange between systems: The Core Vocabularies can form the basis of a context-specific data model to exchange data among existing information systems.</li><li>Data integration: The Core Vocabularies can be used to integrate data disparate data sources.</li><li>Data publishing: The Core Vocabularies can be used as the foundation of a common export format for data in base registries like cadastres, business registers and service portals.</li><li>Development of new systems: The Core Vocabularies can be used as a default starting point for designing the conceptual and logical data models in newly developed information systems.</li></ul><p>ISA² has developed the Core Vocabularies for public administrations in an open process with the active involvement of the SEMIC and Catalogue of Service action stakeholders.</p><p>The Core Vocabularies are:</p><ul><li>Core Person: captures the fundamental characteristics of a person, e.g. name, gender, date of birth, location.</li><li>Core Business: describes legal entities (e.g. its identifier, activities) which are created through a formal registration process, typically in national or regional register.</li><li>Core Location: about the main characteristics of a location, represented as an address, a geographic name or geometry.</li><li>Core Criterion and Core Evidence: describes the principles and the means that a private entity must fulfil to become eligible or qualified to perform public services. A <em>criterion</em> is a rule or a principle that is used to judge, evaluate or test something. <em>Evidence</em> is a means to prove a <em>criterion</em>.</li><li>Core Public Organisation: describes public organisations in the European Union.</li><li>Core Public Service Vocabulary (Application Profile) (CPSV-AP): provides a common data model for describing public services offered by public administrations. It standardises the semantics of personal milestones. The descriptions will make data on these events structured, easier to capture and machine-readable.</li></ul><p><img src="img/35-160.jpeg" alt="35-160.jpeg" /></p><p>	 Digital Public Administration Infrastructure </p><p>	 Digital Public Administration ICT Tools </p><p>7</p><h1><a id="_Toc44407850"></a>Digital Public Administration Infrastructures </h1><h2>Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA)</h2><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/testa_en">TESTA network</a> service originates from the IDA programme (1996). Following this programme, TESTA was passed on to the IDA II, IDABC and ISA programme.</p><p>It is a trusted solution endorsed by the Member States, providing high levels of security (confidentiality and integrity) by-design. The network has connections with all of the EU institutions, EU Agencies, the public administrations in the Member States (EU National networks), FFTA and candidate countries. </p><p>TESTA was developed in response to the need for highly sensitive secure information exchanges between EU public bodies which required guaranteed service levels for network availability, performance and/or security (confidentiality, integrity, authentication, availability). </p><p>TESTA aims at improving the efficiency of cross-border inter-administrative operations. With guaranteed performance levels, it allows connected stakeholders and information systems to communicate at the trans-European level in a safe, reliable and prompt way. </p><h2>GÉANT</h2><p><a href="https://www.geant.org/About">GÉANT</a> is the pan-European research and education network that connects Europe’s National Research and Education Networks (NRENs). </p><p>Through its integrated catalogue of connectivity, collaboration and identity services, GÉANT provides over 50 million users at 10 000 institutions across Europe with highly reliable, unconstrained access to computing, analysis, storage, applications and other resources, to ensure that Europe remains at the forefront of research.</p><h2>Common Communications Network/ Common Systems Interface (CCN/CSI)</h2><p>The CCN/CSI network is a common platform based on the common communication network (hereinafter the ‘CCN’) and common system interface (hereinafter the ‘CSI’), developed by the Union for electronic communications between competent authorities regarding customs and taxation.</p><h2>Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) Building Blocks</h2><p>The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme gives governments, businesses and solutions providers access to free tools to help build digital services. The open and reusable digital solutions provided by the CEF, Building Blocks, are endorsed by the Commission and ensure that the digital services are fully compatible across borders and sectors, helping ensure interoperability.

citizens and businesses in the European Union. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken here as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims at simplifying the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad. In order to do so, Your Europe offers information on basic rights under EU law, but also on how these rights are implemented in each individual country (where information has been provided by the national authorities). Free email or telephone contact with EU assistance services, to get more personalised or detailed help and advice is also available.</p><p>Please note that, in most cases, the EU rights described in <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> apply to all EU member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and sometimes to Switzerland. Information on Your Europe is provided by the relevant departments of the European Commission and complemented by content provided by the authorities of every country it covers. In addition, the implementation of the single digital gateway allows citizens to perform more administrative procedures online. As the website consists of two sections - one for citizens and one for businesses, both managed by DG Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs (DG GROW) - below the main groups of services for each section are listed.</p><h2>Life and Travel</h2><p>For citizens, the following groups of services can be found on the website:</p><ul><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/index_en.htm">Travel</a> (e.g. Documents needed for travelling in Europe); </li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/work/index_en.htm">Work and retirement</a> (e.g. Unemployment and Benefits);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/vehicles/index_en.htm">Vehicles</a> (e.g. Registration);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/residence/index_en.htm">Residence formalities</a> (e.g. Elections abroad);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/education/index_en.htm">Education and youth</a> (e.g. Researchers);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/health/index_en.htm">Health</a> (e.g. Medical Treatment abroad);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/family/index_en.htm">Family</a> (e.g. Couples);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/consumers/index_en.htm">Consumers</a> (e.g. Shopping).</li></ul><h2>Doing Business</h2><p>Regarding businesses, the groups of services on the website concern:</p><ul><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/running-business/index_en.htm">Running a business</a> (e.g. Developing a business);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/taxation/index_en.htm">Taxation</a> (e.g. Business tax);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/selling-in-eu/index_en.htm">Selling in the EU</a> (e.g. Public contracts); </li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/human-resources/index_en.htm">Human Resources</a> (e.g. Employment contracts);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/index_en.htm">Product requirements</a> (e.g. Standards);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/finance-funding/index_en.htm">Financing and Funding</a> (e.g. Accounting);</li><li><a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/dealing-with-customers/index_en.htm">Dealing with Customers</a> (e.g. Data protection).</li></ul><p>The Digital Public Administration Factsheets</p><p>The factsheets present an overview of the state and progress of Digital Government European countries.</p><p>They are published on the Joinup platform, which is a joint initiative by the Directorate General for Informatics (DG DIGIT) and the Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content &amp; Technology (DG CONNECT).
