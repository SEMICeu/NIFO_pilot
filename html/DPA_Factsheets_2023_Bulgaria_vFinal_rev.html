The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-739.x-emf" alt="32-739.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Bulgaria in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-741.x-emf" alt="32-741.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Bulgaria’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring as good as the European average for 10 principles. Particularly, Bulgaria reports a high performance in Recommendation 5 (Principle 3 – Transparency) and Recommendation 6 and 7 (Principle 4 – Reusability), Bulgaria still has margins for further improvement. On the other hand, the country could further ensure that the national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies are aligned with the EIF and tailor and extend them to address the national context and needs (Recommendation 1). Furthermore, Bulgaria could also put additional effort the implementation of Recommendation 19 (Principle 12 – Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) and thus, evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits. Particularly, in this principle, Bulgaria shows a decrease of the performance compared to the previous year. Such reduction will need to be further monitored with the results of 2023.</p><p><img src="img/32-743.x-emf" alt="32-743.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022 </a></p><p>The Bulgarian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall high performance, scoring 4, and at the European average, in all the layers.

Bulgaria has margins for improvement in relation to three indicators (i.e. catalogues, external information sources and services, and security and privacy). Particularly, the Bulgarian score could be further improved by putting into place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions and use common models for describing them (Recommendation 44), and by using external information sources and services while developing European public services, in case possible (Recommendation 45).</p><p><img src="img/32-746.x-emf" alt="32-746.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Bulgaria concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at least upper-middle performance of the country in 16 indicators. Particularly, Bulgaria has a high performance with the maximum score of four in Principle 2 and 4 (i.e. Openness and Cross-boarder reusability) as well as in legal, semantic and technical interoperability (i.e. Recommendation 27, 31 and 33). However, Bulgaria has still margin for improvement in relation to three indicators where the country obtains a low performance. For instance, efforts could focus on the establishment of interoperability agreements in all layers, complemented by operational agreements and change management procedures (i.e. Recommendation 26) and on the development of a shared infrastructure of reusable services and information sources that can be used by all public administrations (i.e. Recommendation 36).</p><p>Additional information on Bulgaria’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through interactive dashboards.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p>	</p><p><img src="img/32-748.png" alt="32-748.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc140677383"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Digital Transformation of Bulgaria for the Period 2020–2030</p><p>On 21 July 2020, the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria approved a national strategy titled ‘<a href="https://egov.government.bg/wps/wcm/connect/egov.government.bg-2818/12cc790a-5c7a-4e3f-99f2-4bdc0bf3afe1/digitaltransformationofbulgariafortheperiod2020-2030f.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CVID=oocXMfO"><a id="_Hlk63779333"></a>Digital Transformation of Bulgaria for the Period 2020–2030</a>’, a document aimed to pave the way for the digital transformation of Bulgaria during the current decade.

This web application is accessible through the European network TESTA. The NSSI has access to the Pension Payment List and the List of Death Certificates via sPAD.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base Registries</h2><p class="subtitle">RegiX</p><p>The Ordinance on the general requirements for information systems, registers and electronic administrative services provides the possibility to access the registers through a central component that ensures compliance with the requirements for interoperability and data exchange. There is such a central component in Bulgaria - <a href="https://info-regix.egov.bg/public">RegiX</a>. </p><p>RegiX is an infrastructure that enables the automated interconnections between multiple Bulgarian registers (currently 76), as well as information systems, in the form of machine-to-machine services. RegiX has been developed as part of the central eGovernment system. The environment for automated interconnections between registers represents a way to facilitate the interaction between administrations, with the goal of providing integrated administrative services. Therefore, administrative authorities that provide public services are encouraged not to require citizens or organisations to transmit the data that the administration already has more than once. Instead, they must officially collect them from the primary administrator of the data. Notifications and requests for data are done electronically and automatically via RegiX, as an internal electronic administrative service. </p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Big Data </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Cloud Computing</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Govtech</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><p><img src="img/32-777.png" alt="32-777.png" /></p><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p><h1><a id="_Toc140677386"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on Bulgaria’s bodies in charge of digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/governance-bulgaria">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474973"></a>National </h2><p class="subtitle">Ministry of eGovernance</p><p>By a <a href="https://dv.parliament.bg/DVWeb/showMaterialDV.jsp?idMat=166432">Decision of the National Assembly of 13 December 2021</a>, a new structure of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria was adopted, foreseeing the establishment of the Ministry of eGovernance. </p><p>With the subsequent amendments to the Law on eGovernment (in force since February 2022), the State eGovernment Agency for Electronic Government (SEGA) was abolished, and the Information Technology Directorate was transferred from the Ministry of Transport and Communications to the newly established Ministry of eGovernance.</p><p>The Ministry of eGovernment has taken over the powers and functions of the Chairman of the State eGovernment Agency and has incorporated the Information Technology Directorate within the Ministry of Transport and Communications.
