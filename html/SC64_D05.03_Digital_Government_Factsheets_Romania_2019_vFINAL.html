Its purpose is to provide access to Danish basic data and facilitate its retrieval through an improved data model compared to the data model applied in the base registries.</p><p>The Data Distributor is the digital infrastructure for the distribution of basic data in Romania. It will gradually replace a number of public distributed solutions and ensure that authorities and companies have easy and secure access to basic data in a single and secure system, instead of many different systems and interfaces. Some technical characteristics of the Data Distributor are:</p><ul><li>Uptime of 99.9%;</li><li>Higher security than the distributed solutions;</li><li>Lower operating and support costs for the exhibition of basic data and support;</li><li>Uniform technical interfaces;</li><li>Uniform data modelling principles.</li></ul><p>The base registries keep the basic data and provide the means to access that data. The authorities responsible for the base registries define the data delivery specifications, within which the frequency of the update and synchronisation specifics is defined. These authorities are also responsible for the collection, reporting and the maintenance of the data. </p><p>The Data Distributor replicates the basic data coming from the base registries using the improved data model described in the previous chapter. By doing this, the Data Distributor avoids duplicates and optimises the search through links between the main entities. This replication of information implies that the Data Distributor is also a redundant platform, which improves and increases the availability of information.</p><p class="subtitle">National Electronic System (NES)</p><p>The draft Law on National Interoperability Framework includes technical specifications to achieve interoperability between systems, products, software, application or service accessible through the National Electronic System (NES) - a common platform for providing several eServices to businesses and citizens via a <a href="http://www.e-guvernare.ro">portal</a>.</p><h1><a id="_Toc12813222"></a>Digital Government Services for Citizens </h1><p>The information in this section presents an overview of the basic public services provided to the citizens.
