The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-1027.x-emf" alt="32-1027.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for France in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-1028.x-emf" alt="32-1028.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>France’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 3 (Transparency) and 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) for which the scores of 3 and 2 respectively show a medium to upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the internal visibility and provision of external interfaces for European public services (Principle 3 – Recommendation 5) and the accessibility of public services to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) could be improved to reach the maximum score of 4 in corresponding principles.</p><p><img src="img/32-1029.x-emf" alt="32-1029.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The French results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall good performance with scores of 3 and 4. The areas that could be improved to support the country's implementation of the Scoreboard 2 recommendations are concentrated in the area of interoperability governance. More specifically, France's score of 1 in Recommendation 23, which states that relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and European level should be consulted when procuring and developing ICT solutions, but also Recommendation 22, which states that using a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to evaluate and select standards and specifications while taking into account relevant EU recommendations and seeking to make the approach consistent across borders, lowers France's overall score in the area of interoperability governance.</p><p><img src="img/32-1030.x-emf" alt="32-1030.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>France’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a very good performance with a maximum score of 4 in the implementation of recommendations associated with base registries, catalogues, security and privacy, internal information sources and services, the conceptual model itself and open data. Although aligned with the EU average or scoring above it, there is still area for improvement regarding the implementation of the recommendations related to external information sources and services. More precisely, the use of external information sources when developing public services (External information sources and services - Recommendation 45) could be developed further, which would consequently improve the overall French score in Scoreboard 3.</p><p><img src="img/32-1031.x-emf" alt="32-1031.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of France concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at upper-middle performance of the country in 16 indicators. Particularly, France has a high performance with the maximum score of four in Principle 2, 8 and 11 (i.e. Openness, Security and privacy and Preservation of information) as well as in legal and technical interoperability (i.e. Recommendation 27 and 33). However, France still has margin for improvement, performing low on some indicators. For instance, efforts could focus on the consultation of relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level, in accordance with your NIF and relevant DIFs, when procuring and developing ICT solutions (i.e. Recommendation 23) and on ensuring that all European public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (i.e. Recommendation 14).  </p><p><a id="_Hlk110241295"></a>Additional information on France’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="img/32-1032.png" alt="32-1032.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc8716907"></a><a id="_Toc140672919"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a><a id="_Toc8716908"></a>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-1033.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

This new digital health service will drastically simplify the daily life of French citizens and their relationship with health data. They are now able to access, manage and share their health data in a secured space and in compliance with GDPR. Please note that ‘<em>Mon Espace Santé</em>’ is being automatically proposed to citizens who can refuse to use it. This makes the suggested ‘100% target’ hardly reachable, as some people will inevitably refuse to open and use the proposed service. This means they simply won’t be able to have a direct access to most of their medical records.</p><p>Since November 2022, the digital service also offers a catalogue of services allowing users to find quality health services and certified applications. These include websites or apps that allow users to make medical appointments, measure their blood pressure or weight, or access recommended tips and news. </p><p>In 2023, data stored on the referenced digital services are planned to be shared in a secure and simple way through ‘<em>Mon Espace Santé</em>’.

With this doctrine, cloud computing has become the default hosting and production mode for the State's digital services, for all new digital products and for products undergoing a substantial evolution. The State’s digital services must now be hosted on one of the two internal interministerial public clouds or on cloud solutions provided by private companies that satisfy strict security criteria. Indeed, the objective of this doctrine is to ensure the State’s sovereignty, the continuity of public services and data protection for citizens. A specific team was set up within DINUM to accompany administrations in making cloud computing a major tool for a quality digital transformation and to animate a community of public actors on this topic.

In September 2018, the French administration received 650,000 successful calls, corresponding to as many supporting documents that did not need to be produced. This saves time for families: in the past, some parents had to take half a day off work to submit their applications, others to ask their children to queue during recess.<strong> </strong>Today, to replace a supporting document with a call to API Particulier users must still enter specific information to the administration, such as tax number or beneficiary number. The French administration would like users to be able to identify themselves more easily through <a href="https://franceconnect.gouv.fr/">FranceConnect</a>.<strong> </strong>Thus, with a single login and password, the API hub would allow everyone to simplify their procedures. </p><p class="subtitle">FranceConnect</p><p>In 2016, France launched a digital identity federator called ‘<a href="https://franceconnect.gouv.fr/"><em>France Connect</em></a>’ in order to simplify access to public and private services for French citizens. It relies on pre-existing accounts widely used by French citizens such as health insurance accounts, tax administration accounts, the digital identity proposed by the French postal service, etc. At this stage, 35 million people use it on a regular basis to connect to over 1 500 online services, both public and private (mostly banking and insurance services for the private sector). In 2021, France notified its first eIDAS scheme with Substantial assurance level.

The RNA also contains, under the same conditions, associations recognised as being of public utility.</p><p class="subtitle">Operational Register of Jobs</p><p>The <a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/repertoire-operationnel-des-metiers-et-des-emplois-rome/">Operational Register of Jobs</a> (ROME) of the French Employment Authority (<em>Pôle emploi</em>) is a tool for professional mobility and for matching job offers with candidates.</p><p>ROME was built by French Employment Authority teams with the contribution of a large network of partners (companies, professional branches and unions, the National Agency for the Professional Training of Adults, etc.), based on a pragmatic approach: inventory of the most common job titles, analysis of activities and skills, grouping of jobs according to a principle of equivalence or proximity.</p><h2>Innovative Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle">AI Lab and AI Projects</p><p>Following the announcement of a national strategy for AI in March 2018 by the President of the French Republic, an interministerial ‘<a href="https://www.etalab.gouv.fr/lab-ia/">AI Lab</a>’ was set up in early 2019 within the Etalab department of DINUM. This AI lab intends to:</p><ul><li>Support AI projects in administrations;</li><li>Develop mutualised AI solutions addressing recurring needs in administrations;</li><li>Animate the community of AI experts in administrations;</li><li>Develop AI ethics in the public sector and transparency towards citizens; and</li><li>Build partnerships with researchers on AI.</li></ul><p>Through three calls for proposals, 25 projects have been supported, serving public policies as critical as environmental protection, employment, health and social services, or the fight against frauds.</p><p>The projects supported are also representative of the various potential uses of AI: helping to target controls, improving the relationship with the user, improving business processes, etc. and leverage a wide range of AI techniques: automatic detection of objects in images (e.g. detection of illegal constructions), natural understanding and voice synthesis (e.g. conversational agent for ACOSS), extraction of information from texts and automatic language processing (in partnership with the Nuclear Safety Authority, the Toulouse University Hospital).</p><h3>Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Big Data </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Cloud Computing</h3><p>Cloud Computing Infrastructure – ‘Cloud au centre’</p><p>In July 2021, France adopted a doctrine for the use of cloud computing technology by the French State, called “<a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/services/cloud/doctrine/">Cloud au centre</a>”. With this doctrine, cloud computing has become the default hosting and production mode for the State's digital services, for all new digital products and for products undergoing a substantial evolution. The State’s digital services must now be hosted on one of the two internal interministerial public clouds or on cloud solutions provided by industrials satisfying strict security criteria. Indeed, the objective of this doctrine is to ensure the State’s sovereignty, the continuity of the public services and data protection for citizens. A specific team was set up within DINUM to accompany administrations in making cloud computing a major tool for a quality digital transformation and to animate a community of public actors on this topic. This team works closely with the French Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI) in order to ensure a secure environment for the use of cloud computing technology by the French State. </p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>GovTech</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><p><img src="img/32-1044.png" alt="32-1044.png" /></p><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p><h1><a id="_Toc140672922"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on French bodies responsible for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-france">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2>National </h2><p class="subtitle">Ministry for Public Sector Transformation and the Civil Service</p><p>In France, the eGovernment strategy is under responsibility of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Public Sector Transformation and the Civil Service, who is in charge of public service transformation and State modernisation.</p><p class="subtitle">Interministerial Digital Directorate (DINUM)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/dinsic">Interministerial Digital Directorate (DINUM)</a>, which succeeded to the Interministerial Directorate for Digital Affairs and State Information and Communication System (DINSIC) in 2019, is a Prime Minister’s service, placed under the authority of the Ministry for Public Sector Transformation and the Civil Service. </p><p>DINUM is in charge of directing, leading, supporting and coordinating public administrations’ actions aiming at enhancing the quality, efficiency and reliability of the services provided by the State's information and communication system.
