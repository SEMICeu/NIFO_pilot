The mid-upper performance of Ukraine for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) indicates that Ukrainian public administrations could improve their performance on the implementation of this principle by ensuring that their national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies are aligned with the EIF and, if needed, tailor and extend them to address the national context and needs.

The document provided the MDT’s vision on the digital infrastructure development and the key objectives of digital transformation in Ukraine. While developing this concept note, the experts used a multi-stakeholder approach. By doing so, the main purpose of State authorities was to determine, prioritise, and coordinate the stakeholders’ interests. The draft concept underlines three priorities to be achieved by 2023. These priorities are:</p><ul><li>The enhancement of public eServices; </li><li>The development of broadband internet connections; and</li><li>The implementation of innovative technologies and optical networks. 	</li></ul><p>The enhancement of public eServices aims to facilitate the delivery of eServices to both citizens and businesses. The digitalisation of business processes in public bodies will simplify the interaction between citizens, businesses and the State, resulting in higher efficiency. </p><p>The broadband development represents the basis for the development of public digital infrastructure. In order to ensure the demand of broadband connections, the MDT insists on prioritising the connection of social infrastructure to the broadband (i.e. schools, libraries, museums, healthcare institutions, administrative service offices etc.). </p><p>The implementation of innovative technologies and optical networks is paramount to enable the development of the 5<sup>th</sup> generation connection in Ukraine. As optical networks are a basic infrastructure for 5G connection, their development is a priority for the next five years. </p><p>The draft has not been adopted yet but is expected to be approved in 2022.</p><p class="subtitle">Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Decree No. 849 on the Approval of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine Action Programme</p><p>On 29 September 2019, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted its <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/849-2019-Ð¿">Acti</a>on Programme.

As a result, it will be technically possible to verify the e-signature of Estonia in Ukraine and vice versa.</p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Action Plan on Implementation of Cybersecurity Strategy in Ukraine</p><p>In July 2018, the government approved the <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/481-2018-%D1%80">Action Plan on the Implementation of a Cybersecurity Strategy in Ukraine</a>. This plan implemented cybersecurity initiatives in 18 areas, including ensuring the legislative framework in the sphere of cyber security, the development of the technological component of the national cyber security system, establishing relations with international partners of Ukraine, and establishing the process of personnel training on cyber security.</p><h3>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>Mapping Report on State Electronic Information Resources. Status and Perspectives</p><p>The State Agency for eGovernance of Ukraine launched a <a href="http://tapas.org.ua/en/all/news/e-mapping-report/">Mapping Report on State Electronic Information Resources. Status and Perspectives</a>, which provides the state of play of base registries in Ukraine. According to the report, there were more than 135 State information resources (registries) owned by more than 40 State authorities in Ukraine. Per the calculations based on the 23 analysed registries, the State spent an average UAH 21 million (approximately EUR 713,000) per year on the maintenance of each registry. The report stressed problems on the interconnection of base registries and the lack of proper identifiers (low level of distribution of digital ID numbers among citizens and lack of the identifiers in existing State registries). The report included a list of recommendations for improvements, i.e. readying State registries for their integration into the national interoperability system, distribution of unique registration numbers (UNRs), development and adoption of the law regulating development, functionality and maintenance of State registries, prevention of State registries data fragmentation and duplication, efficiency improvement of IT infrastructure management for State bodies.</p><p class="subtitle">Research on Anti-Corruption Impact of Public Registries</p><p>In July 2021, the MDT prepared a report on the anti-corruption analysis of ten selected registries (both in <a href="https://tapas.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Zvit_Analiz-potochnogo-stanu-reestriv-_UA.pdf" target="_blank">Ukrainian</a> and <a href="https://tapas.org.ua/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Report_State-Registries-and-Corruption-Risks_EN.pdf" target="_blank">English</a>). The analysis is being conducted using a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzKVuEpnuAUlEELgZATwZqjQog96x5tJ7oNonqy_uSo/edit" target="_blank">methodology</a> which has been approved by the MDT. The purpose of this task is to analyse the legislative and financial aspects of ten public registries as well as the quality, accessibility and openness of their data. As part of this task, the experts have also analysed potential corruption-related activities that could take place within the registries (e.g., hostile takeovers) and they have provided recommendations on how to improve the current state of play of the analysed registries. According to the report, the most frequent corruption-related activities within the registries include: unauthorised registration, illegal registration (i.e., hostile takeovers), registration with forged documents or papers that don’t exist, ‘ghost’ payments (i.e., payments to deceased or non-existent persons), and data selling. The general recommendations on how to avoid these activities include: introducing automatic monitoring of risky registration actions to prevent illegal registration, adding a double verification process to check for the legality of the registrar's actions, improving technical and functional properties of registry software and its interactions with users (technical support); improving and centralising the management system of state registries (i.e. developing a single legislation framework, introducing a national system of accounting for intellectual property rights to State registry software and for licenses) and others. More detailed recommendations for each of the analysed registries can be found in the report. </p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>eHealth Action Plan</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/storage/app/sites/1/17-prezentation-2019/10.2019/plan-zahodiv.pdf">eHealth Action Plan</a> was approved on 1 October 2019.

The decree provides the general requirements for the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure objects. This document was adopted according to the <a href="https://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2163-19">Law on Basic Principles of Cybersecurity in Ukraine</a>. These requirements were developed on the basis of the best international practices laid down by the European Union and the USA and are harmonised with the international standards of the EU, NATO and NIST on cybersecurity matters. The implementation of cybersecurity standards allows organisations belonging to the critical infrastructure to ensure cybersecurity, prevent any breach of confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of their information resources and protect the sustainable functionality of critical infrastructure objects.</p><p class="subtitle">Law on the Basic Principles of Cybersecurity in Ukraine</p><p>On 8 July 2018, the <a href="https://zakon2.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2163-19">Law on the Basic Principles of Cybersecurity in Ukraine</a> came into force. This law determined the basis for the protection of national interests in the cyberspace; the key objectives, directions and principles of State policy in the sphere of cybersecurity; and the powers of State entities and their main coordination principles. Furthermore, this law anticipated the development of the State cybersecurity system and computer emergency response team <a href="https://cert.gov.ua/">CERT-UA</a>. It launched a process of complex regulation of cybersecurity as a separate sphere. It determined the legislative framework of definitions dealing with cybersecurity, cyber-attack and cyber protection. It expanded the provisions of cyber security strategy already adopted in 2016.</p><p class="subtitle">Law No. 681-IX on Information Protection in Information and Telecommunications Systems </p><p>On 2 July 2020, the <em>Verkhovna Rada</em> of Ukraine (Parliament of Ukraine) adopted the amendments to the <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/80/94-Ð²Ñ#Text">Law of Ukraine No. 681-IX on Information Protection in Information and Telecommunications Systems</a>.

One of the articles in the draft law prohibits public authorities from requesting data from citizens if they already exist in the registries. After its implementation, citizens will not need to provide copies of their passports, ID numbers or else to obtain a public service. This means better quality and full automatization of public services delivery, which is the next step for going paperless in Ukraine. By law, all data interaction between the registries shall take place exclusively via the TREMBITA interoperability system.  It also regulates the functioning of the Registry of Registries (i.e. the catalogue of public registries). The draft law also mandates the creation of the national eArchive for long-term data preservation. This law allows saving public money by optimizing the number of electronic registries. Currently, there are more than 350 registries in Ukraine that need hundreds of millions of UAH for annual maintenance. For instance, the 25 key public registries alone need 500 million UAH for their annual maintenance. Optimizing the number of public registries and introducing data interaction between the existing ones will reduce their maintenance budget by up to 15%. The law regulates the self-efficiency of public registries and promotes the use of government data by businesses. The law suggests the financial model to financially support the system of public registries. From now on, businesses can purchase anonymised (i.e. open) data from public registries to develop the projects based on government data. The document establishes single technical rules for all state entities on how to create, maintain or delete registry files, which will increase the transparency in the sector and prevent illegal takeovers in public registries. The document allows citizens to have prompt access to up-to-date, government-held information about themselves (e.g., basic personal data, information on land ownership, real estate/property, aggregate income data). In case of any changes in personal information, the citizens will receive a notification about such changes, which will also facilitate the prevention of illegal takeovers in the registries.</li></ul><h3>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474969"></a>Decree No. 985/2019 On the Pilot Project for the Implementation of Electronic Auctions to Sell the Tangible Assets of the State Material Reserve </p><p>On 4 December 2019, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/985-2019-Ð¿">Decree No. 985 on </a>the <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/985-2019-Ð¿">Pilot Project for the Implementation of Electronic Auctions to Sell the Tangible Assets of the State Material Reserve. </a>The decree defined the procedure for conducting the pilot project.

The Diia State eServices portal with its User's eCabinet was introduced in April 2020. This is an entirely new approach to the eService delivery system. This platform contains both an eServices portal (one-stop-shop platform) and an information system (middleware, or process engine). The platform provides citizens and businesses with comprehensive information on available State eServices and gives them the opportunity to obtain high-quality eServices based on a unique service design. As of March 2022, there are more than 50 eServices available on the Diia portal. Since its launch, the portal was visited by 8 million unique users. The main concept behind the creation of the User’s eCabinet is to provide a single point of entry allowing citizens to access and retrieve information about themselves. The User’s eCabinet will not store any personal data. Instead, it will display current information about the citizen from State registries and provide convenient access to other eCabinets and services without the need for additional authorisation. The User’s eCabinet will be a component within the State eServices platform. The eCabinet will also track changes and automatically notify citizens if and when their personal information has been altered or deleted. In situations where unauthorised changes have been made to personal information, the user will be able to react in a timely manner and rectify the situation by petitioning the relevant government entity responsible for the data, or by appealing to a court against the unauthorised activity. As of March 2022, there are 14 public registries integrated into the User’s eCabinet on the Diia portal and thus, inside the portal’s eCabinet, registered users can find information about their vehicle ownership, land ownership, immovable property ownership and private entrepreneurship status, information about their debts (if any), voter information, employment records as well as users tax information. </p><p class="subtitle">State Mobile Application Diia </p><p>The <a href="https://go.diia.app/">Diia mobile application</a> was introduced two months before the Portal, in February 2020. The first user-friendly eServices contained in the Diia mobile application are nine digital documents (i.e., electronic driver licence, electronic vehicle registration document (vehicle technical passport), Ukrainian ID (ID card), Ukrainian passports for traveling abroad, student ID, car insurance, individual tax number, birth certificate and internally displaced persons certificate), digital COVID-19 certificate and international COVID-19 certificate (which is mutually recognisable with all EU countries). Moreover, the Diia mobile application offers the following eServices: obtaining information about traffic violations tickets and paying for them, as well as information about the user’s administrative debts and payment for them directly using the Diia mobile app. On 8 February 2022, the MDT unveiled new eServices on the Diia application: change of place of residence; criminal record certificate; sharing of a technical passport for a vehicle (done via QR code); financial assistance for internally displaced people (IDPs); and a polling function through which Ukrainians have the opportunity to express an opinion via polls organized by government authorities in Diia. In total, more than 14 million of Ukrainians use the Diia mobile application. According to <a href="https://tns-ua.com/news/reyting-mobilnih-dodatkiv-za-veresen-2021">the research</a>, the Diia mobile app is one of the most popular mobile applications in Ukraine. 54% of all Internet users if Ukraine have the Diia app. </p><p class="subtitle">Public Services Guide on the Diia Portal </p><p>On 27 August 2020, the MDT launched the <a href="https://guide.diia.gov.ua/">Public Services Guide</a> on the Diia eServices Portal. The guide is a registry of Administrative Services and one of the Diia portal’s modules. It is a single database of administrative services designed to provide full and accurate information about public services. Previously, there was no clear understanding of the actual number of public services available or how to obtain them. Moreover, a single service could go by different names, and State authorities could demand different documents from citizens in order to provide the same service. This would create opportunities for petty corruption and waste citizens’ time and resources. Each service in the registry is assigned a unique code that is used when users receive services through the Diia portal and in ASCs. </p><p>When necessary, the registry also allows administrators to insert or edit the service description, and the registry contains a search function based on classifiers (i.e. categories, State entities, documents, results, life events, grounds for refusal). Currently, the guide contains information on over 2,200 public services (including electronic and paper-based services). The data on these services is divided into 17 categories of business activities and is arranged among 36 life events (e.g. starting a business, changing your place of residence, having a baby, or buying a vehicle; you can find all the information about where to obtain these services, their price, terms, etc. in the guide). The guide provides citizens and businesses with easily searchable and credible information about the services as well as how to obtain them.  </p><p class="subtitle">Diia.Business Platform</p><p>In February 2020, the MDT launched an online platform for entrepreneurs called <a href="https://business.diia.gov.ua/en">Diia.Business</a>.
