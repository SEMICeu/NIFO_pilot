With 13 million French people who still do not use the Internet, or only to a limited extent, including 6.7 million who never connect to the Internet, this is a real challenge for the Government which is committed to carrying out the digital transformation of the State. This national strategy is based on four main approaches:</p><ul><li>Detecting audiences in difficulty with digital technology;</li><li>Offer human support in the process;</li><li>Train those who wish to do so thanks to the Digital Pass;</li><li>Consolidate the players in digital mediation.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Publication of departmental transformation plans</p><p>Following the roadmap that the Prime Minister sent to each member of the executive at the beginning of his term of office, each minister has now drawn up a <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/action-publique-2022/plans-de-transformation/les-plans-de-transformation-ministeriels">transformation plan</a>, for which he/she is responsible, in order to ensure the implementation of the main reforms.

It has three objectives: improving the quality of the service provided to the user, improving the working conditions of staff and helping to control the budget path. To achieve these objectives, the Government developed a national strategy for the transformation of public action, published at the <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/action-publique-2022/actualites/un-2eme-comite-interministeriel-de-la-transformation-publique-ce-quil-faut-retenir">second Inter-ministerial Committee on Public Transformation</a> in October 2018.

The contributions were incorporated into the Digital Bill.</p><p>The Bill’s Decrees established the following principles: </p><ul><li><strong>Net neutrality</strong>: the French <a href="https://www.arcep.fr/">Authority for Regulation of the Electronic Communications and Postal sectors (ARCEP)</a> will be responsible for ensuring that operators will not discriminate in providing access to the network on the basis of services; </li><li><strong>Data portability</strong>: email providers are required to allow the migration of user's emails as well as their contact lists when they decide to change service provider; </li><li><strong>Right to maintain the connection: </strong>households experiencing payment difficulties may receive financial assistance from a universal solidarity fund. Their connection shall be maintained by their access provider while their assistance request is under examination; </li><li><strong>Confidentiality of private correspondence: </strong>emails are considered as confidential as physical letters, and may not be analysed by email services, except to detect spam and viruses.; </li><li><strong>Right to be forgotten for minors: </strong>persons who were minors at the time their personal data was collected in connection with information society services are entitled to have their personal data erased by the data controller.

The former Secretary of state for Public accounts and State reform, Thierry Mandon, announced, at the Council of Ministers, forty measures to be adopted by the government in order to simplify the lives of citizens. These measures are the result of <a href="http://www.faire-simple.gouv.fr/">public consultation between 9 July and 15 September 2014,</a> during which more than 2000 proposals were made by users. The ordinance effectively defined the conditions and procedures for exercising the right of users to communicate electronically with the different administrations. It remained aligned with the ordinance No. 2013 - 1005 adopted on 12 November 2013, that allowed for the simplification of the relation between the administration and users.  </p><p>Thierry Mandon presented a list of these 40 measures, many of which represented a great step forward for users as they enabled services such as scheduling an appointment at the CAF (<em>Caisse d'allocations familiales</em>) online or applying for the Vitale card online, getting a personal medical certificate, payments of fines via smartphone or purchasing stamps online and several other eServices.</p><p>All matters relevant to the relationship between users and administration (central administration, regional governments and private legal entities having a public service mandate) are now gathered in one single code <em>Code des relations entre le public et l'administration</em> which came into force on 1 January 2016.</p><p>The code deals with such matters as the digital exchange and referral modalities of the administration, the obligation for administration to provide e-services to citizens (e-procedures, e-forms...), the obligation for the administration to acknowledge receipt of digital referrals.

This bill complemented regulatory and non-regulatory measures as well as tax measures that are incorporated into the 2019 finance bill. All these measures made up the Action Plan for the Growth and Transformation of Enterprises (PACTE). The PACT was a new step in the country's economic transformation. It was the fourth phase of the economic reforms initiated by the Government more than a year ago. It was in line with ordinances for strengthening social dialogue and the tax reform initiated by the 2018 Finance Act. It acted in parallel with the draft law on the freedom to choose one's professional future in order to give small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the means to create jobs. The PACTE was the result of a co-construction process initiated with companies, parliamentarians and local authorities in October 2017. Following this first phase of consultation, companies, individuals and professional federations were able to express their views in early 2018, during an online public consultation that gathered several thousand contributions and counted 65 000 votes. The PACT had two objectives: to make companies grow so that they create more jobs and to redefine the place of the company in society in order to better involve employees. </p><h1><a id="_Toc8716929"></a><a id="_Toc12883071"></a>Digital Government Governance</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474973"></a><a id="_Toc8716930"></a>National </h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474974"></a><a id="_Toc8716931"></a>Policy</h3><p class="subtitle">Secretary of State for Reform and Simplification of the State </p><p>In France, the eGovernment strategy is under responsibility of the Prime Minister, Mr Philippe, with support of the Secretary of State for the Digital Sector.

This strategy of transforming the state information system presupposes that the administration itself needs to bring together the various data of the user necessary for its purposes and offers in return almost ready-to-use services. It deals with services centred on its needs, and not from the organisational carving of administrative structures. The main principles of the State platform are the opening of API by large public providers of data, the flow of data between administrations, and the flow control by users through France Connect.</p><p class="subtitle">ePassports</p><p>In April 2006, the Ministry for Internal Affairs announced the calendar for the introduction of the first <a href="https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N360">electronic passports</a> in France, progressively introduced between April and July 2006. Embedded with a contact-less chip, the French ePassport contained the digitalised photograph of its owner. The passport was intended to be more than a simple travel document; it could be used for the fulfilment of administrative formalities in the future. On 28 June 2009, electronic passports were replaced by the biometric passports containing in addition the holder’s digitised <strong>fingerprints</strong>.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a><a id="_Toc8716951"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Purchase of fiscal stamps</p><p>This <a href="https://timbres.impots.gouv.fr/">new online service</a> allows the purchase of fiscal stamps.

All Central Government ministries – with the exception of the Ministry of Defence, which has its own platform – can meet this requirement by using the <a href="https://www.marches-publics.gouv.fr/?page=entreprise.AccueilEntreprise">Government-wide eProcurement platform</a>. The platform allows public sector bodies to publish <strong>calls for tenders online</strong> and receive electronic bids. It is commercialised by <a href="http://www.ugap.fr/">UGAP</a>, an inter-ministerial service dedicated to enhancing the efficiency of public procurement.</p><p>The use of the platform by <strong>local authorities</strong> is optional, as these are free to develop their own eProcurement solutions or to adopt commercial solutions, already created on a regional and a local level. In this light, it is worth noting that the Public Procurement Code states that as from 1 January 2010, the French contracting authorities have the right to require the transmission of applications and tenders in electronic format only.</p><p class="subtitle">eMarketplace of the Burgundy region</p><p>This <a href="https://marches.e-bourgogne.fr/">portal</a> is aimed at more than <strong>2 000 public authorities </strong>and<strong> institutions</strong> in the administrative region of Burgundy in the east of France.

This eMartketplace was piloted with the support of the French Government as part of France’s ADELE plan for eGovernment and launched as an operational service at the beginning of 2005. After a successful regional experimentation of its eMarketplace, the Burgundy region has created a consortium made up of five regional authorities of EU countries along with public and private partners in order to put in place the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/servlets/Doc2c2c.pdf?id=30098">eTENProcure project</a>.
