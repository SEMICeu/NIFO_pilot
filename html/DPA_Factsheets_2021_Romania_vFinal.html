The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States.

The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation.

Nonetheless, areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 3 (Transparency), 6 (User-centricity), 10 (Security and Privacy), 11(Preservation of information) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) for which the scores of 1 and 2 show a medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, an area that can be improved in Romania would be to formulate a long-term preservation policy for information related to European public services, and especially for information that is exchanged across borders (Principle 11 - Recommendation 18).</p><p><img src="img/35-805.jpeg" alt="35-805.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Romanian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 can be partially analysed due to the absence of data for areas relating to interoperability governance and semantic interoperability. With the data available, Romania shows an upper-medium performance with potential areas of improvement concentrated in integrated public service governance and legal interoperability. More specifically, the score of 1 for the country in Recommendation 26 could be improved by putting in place interoperability agreements in all layers which would then be complemented by operational agreements and change management procedures.</p><p><img src="img/35-806.jpeg" alt="35-806.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Romania’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an overall upper-medium performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with base registries, catalogues, external information sources and services, as well as security and privacy.

Furthermore, it provides information about the national business context, objectives and benefits, the authorities concerned, legislation in the field and financing arrangements.</p><p>The platform was updated and relaunched in 2016. The new platform allows Ministries to send documents and requests to the citizens, so that citizens do not have to go to the counter to submit them physically. The platform contains a full set of forms, procedures and legislation references, so that citizens are aware of any public procedure or service.</p><p class="subtitle">Open Data Portal: data.gov.ro </p><p>The Romanian <a href="http://www.data.gov.ro">data.gov.ro</a> portal collects all the datasets from public authorities and makes them available in one central portal, accessible to all. </p><h3>Subnational Portals</h3><p>No infrastructure in this field has been reported to date. </p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle">Local Communities Electronic Networks</p><p>The <a href="http://www.ecomunitate.ro/proiect">Local Communities Electronic Networks (LCENs)</a> connect local communities (schools, public offices and libraries) to the internet. Public access points have been set up in each area covered by the networks. The objectives are to reduce the rural-urban digital divide, stimulate the use of ICTs in schools, and facilitate the interaction between citizens and administration. The network has covered 255 rural communities and small towns throughout Romania, targeting over 1.7 million Romanian citizens (10% of Romanian rural areas).</p><p class="subtitle">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations </p><p>Romania uses the Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) network as the main cross-border infrastructure to communicate digitally among the EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p>No infrastructure in this field has been reported to date. </p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">Interoperability System with EU Member States</p><p>The ADR is implementing the <a href="https://www.adr.gov.ro/sistem-de-interoperabilitate-tehnologica-cu-statele-membre-ue-situe/">SITUE project</a> (Interoperability System with EU Member States), aimed at implementing the interoperability system with EU Member States.

Implementing the PSCID provides: (i) more powerful tools; (ii) secure electronic authentication for accessing and using public electronic services and unit management; (iii) centralised identification of citizens’ electronic identities and their credentials; and (iv) the provision of identities in target systems that provide electronic services.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a href="http://www.e-licitatie.ro/Public/Common/Content.aspx?f=PublicHomePage">National eProcurement System</a></p><p>Romania has a central <a href="http://www.e-licitatie.ro/pub">eProcurement Platform</a> that is under the responsibility of the ADR.

The system is the national single point for the transmission of public procurement notices to the EU Official Journal (as OJS eSender). Furthermore, it offers interactive and transactional services dedicated to sustaining 20% of the total amount of public acquisition.</p><p>In March 2017, Romania launched a <a href="https://www.adr.gov.ro/proiecte-in-implementare/platforma-software-centralizata-pentru-identificare-digitala-pscid/">project</a>, funded through the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/connecting-europe-facility">Connecting Europe Facility Programme</a>, to integrate the eCertis service into eProcurement. </p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing</p><p>Economic operators are free to choose their preferred service provider to submit eInvoices to contracting authorities.
