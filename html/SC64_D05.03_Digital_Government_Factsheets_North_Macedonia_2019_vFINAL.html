The fourth area in the strategy is Service Delivery and ICT Support of Administration. </p><p>Public Administration Reform (PAR) is a continuous process of reorganisation of public sector institutions and improvement of their administrative capacity. It is one of the key priorities in the Accession Partnership, and an important precondition in the process of European integration of the Republic of North Macedonia. Initiatives for the modernisation and promotion of the administration remain ongoing. The state and public administration are seen as the basis of the overall public sector, which depends on the processes and development in any democratic society. Public sector work reflects democratic values ​​as a whole and in that sense all institutions have the responsibility to work towards achieving better value for citizens and businesses and thus ensure social and economic development, that is, prosperity of the state as a whole.</p><p>In response to assessments from the European Union to improve improving the public administration, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia (GRM) Work Programme  for 2017-2020 set the following strategic target: "The Government of the Republic of North Macedonia will work to create an expert and efficient, accountable and transparent administration that will provide quality services for the citizens and the business sector and will protect their rights. By applying the principles of fairness and professionalism in employment and objectivity in the promotion and rewarding of employees in the public administration, the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia will create an administration that will be free from party affiliations and will be committed to solving the problems of citizens and business entities, respecting the principles of legality and impartiality in the exercise of their duty.”</p><p>Reform in public administration in the context of this strategy means reform in the following priority areas:</p><p>1. Policy creation and coordination;</p><p>2. Public service and human resources management;</p><p>3. Responsibility, accountability and transparency; and</p><p>4. Public services and ICT support to the administration.</p><p>Consequently, the PAR Strategy 2018-2022 has four general objectives:</p><p>OC1: Effective, efficient and inclusive policies;</p><p>OC2: Professional, professional and departed administration;</p><p>OC3: Responsible, accountable and transparent operation of the institutions; and</p><p>OC4: Providing services in a fast, simple and easily accessible way.</p><p>In order to achieve the defined goal in the priority area of delivering services and ICT support to the administration, measures and activities will be undertaken which lead to investments in the development of the digital environment. The quality and availability of public services will be increased to give access to, and the ability to use, e-services. Measures and activities include the development of strategies, programmes and methodologies; conducting analyses and projects based on the findings and recommendations from the analyses; research on introducing innovative solutions; simplifications and facilitation of processes; and more. One of the most important features is the active involvement of users in the process of defining and designing the services, which will be developed according to their needs.</p><p class="subtitle">Programme of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia </p><p>The <a href="http://vlada.mk/sites/default/files/programa/2017-2020/Programa_Vlada_2017-2020_MKD.pdf">Programme of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia (2017-2020)</a> is broad and covers a variety of different domains. There is a specific assessment for the IT sector and a plan to help public administrations transition towards new technologies. The goal of the Government will be the development of the IT sector as well as the simplification and acceleration of communication between citizens and public administrations. The government will give priority to the creation of electronic registers as the basis for all electronic government services provided to citizens and businesses.</p><p class="subtitle">National Long-Term ICT Strategy</p><p>During 2018, a Roadmap was developed with directions to prepare a National Long-Term ICT Strategy, aligned with the Digital Agenda for Europe 2020. The roadmap was outlined in the <a href="http://mioa.gov.mk/?q=mk/node/1587">PAR report of 2018</a>. With the aim of harmonising and introducing all strategies from the ICT field under its umbrella, the e-Government Strategy and Implementation Action Plan, as well as the development of the Policy for the use of "Cloud" infrastructure, will be included in this long-term ICT strategy.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Strategy and Action Plan for Open Data </p><p>The <a href="http://mioa.gov.mk/?q=mk/node/1825">Strategy and Action Plan for Open Data 2018-2020</a> were adopted in July 2018. </p><p>The Open Data Strategy set forth measures to be undertaken for encouraging the release and use of public data, and to implement them broadly in order to contribute in raising transparency and accountability of state institutions. This will improve the quality of services they offer and at the same time stimulate innovation, thus contributing to the development of North Macedonia’s society and economy as a whole.</p><p>The Open Data Strategy aims to encourage the promotion and use of open data with the understanding that data produced by governmental and public sector bodies are an asset for the citizens of North Macedonia. </p><p>The Strategy envisages deploying a central government open data portal, developing a methodology for data inventory and conducting an inventory in state institutions. It will introduce a licensing model for data, establish a management structure and guidelines to facilitate the release of datasets; and raise awareness and foster the creation of public value through collaboration and partnerships with stakeholders from within and outside the public sector. </p><p>North Macedonia’s open data strategy aims to develop a dynamic open data ecosystem in which data are produced, opened enriched and reused by multiple actors from the public and private sector, civil society and academia. As a result, it will lead to improved public service delivery and public sector efficiency, increased public engagement, support efforts to combat corruption and contribute to the creation of an innovative climate that delivers new economic opportunities for the business sector. </p><p>This strategy will also contribute to ensure that North Macedonia meets EU requirements on government transparency and accountability, and most specifically the goals set with the Reuse of Public Sector Information directive and other measures supporting the opening up of public sector information.</p><p class="subtitle">Third Action Plan for Open Government Partnership of North Macedonia </p><p>In July 2016, the Government of North Macedonia adopted a third <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/country/macedonia/action-plan">Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership</a>. Just like under the previous Action Plans, for the next two years, the Government of North Macedonia committed to increase efforts to make public institutions open, transparent, accountable and efficient. Action Plan implementation involved undertaking a number of activities for building citizen and company partnerships in designing national policies and drafting national legislation, strategies, and initiatives. Additionally, interactive web portals were established in order to facilitate the consultation process, increase transparency and allow for participation in discussions. </p><p>The Open Government Partnership Action Plan focused on six thematic areas: participatory policy-making, open data, public access to information, reducing corruption and promoting the rule of law, efficient management of public resources and local level openness. The Action Plan outlined key developments the Government pledged to take in each of the thematic areas, the responsible institutions for each, and the planned timeline for their achievement. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>Security aspects related to digital government</h3><p class="subtitle">National Cyber Security Strategy and Action Plan 2018-2022</p><p>The <a href="http://mioa.gov.mk/?q=mk/node/1813">Strategy for Cyber Security</a> was first adopted in August 2018; its <a href="http://www.mioa.gov.mk/sites/default/files/pbl_files/documents/strategies/ap_cybersec_v1.13_eng.pdf">Action Plan</a> was developed at a later date.
