The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-497.png" alt="32-497.png" /></p><p> Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022 </a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Portugal in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-523.x-emf" alt="32-523.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Portuguese results on Scoreboard 1 showcase an overall good implementation of the 12 EIF Principles. Indeed, the country received the highest score of 4 and is above the EU average on 9 Principles out of 12. The country fares particularly well on Princple 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and Principle 12 (Assessment of effectiveness and efficiency), where it scores well above the EU average. Nonetheless, potential areas of improvement can be found for Principle 9 (Multilingualism) for which the score of 2 could be further improved. In particular, Portugal should further use information systems and technical, architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16). </p><p><img src="img/32-531.x-emf" alt="32-531.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Portugal’s scores on Scoreboard 2 illustrate an overall good performance of the country with scores of 3 and 4 on all the interoperability layers. Areas of improvement to strengthen the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are mostly related to interoperability governance and legal interoperability. More precisely, the country should further use a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assess and select standards and specifications (Interoperability governance – Recommendation 22). In addition, Pourtgual should continue to ensure that legislation is screended by means of ‘interoperability checks’, to identify any barriers to interoperability. Indeed, when it drafts a new legislation, it should seek to make it consistent with relevant legislation, by performing a ‘digital check’ and considering data protection requirements (Legal interoperability – Recommendation 27). </p><p><img src="img/32-540.x-emf" alt="32-540.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Portuguese results with regard to Scoreboard 3 on the Conceputal model show an overall good performance, with only scores of 3 and 4. Indeed, the country scores above the EU average in 5 out of the 7 areas of the Conceptual model. Potential areas of improvement are focused on the area of Catalogues and External information sources and services, although one recommendation related to Base Registries receiving a score of 2 could also be further improved. More precisely, Portugal should further create and follow data quality assurance plans for base registries and related master data, in order to improve its score on this recommendation (Base Registries – Recommendation 40). In addition, it should continue putting in place catalogues of public services, public data and interoperability solutions and use common models for describing them (Catalogues – Recommendation 44) as well as further use external information sources and services while developing European public services (External information sources and services – Recommendation 45). </p><p><img src="img/32-549.x-emf" alt="32-549.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Portugal on Scoreboard 4 on the Cross-Border Interoperability aspect showcase an overall good performance. Particularly, the country received the maximum score of 4 for five EIF Principles, four interoperability layers and three areas of the Conceptual model. Nonetheless, there are still some areas for improvement related to Principle 9 (Multilingualism – Cross-border) and the Base Registries area, for which the country received a score of 2. More particularly, Portugal should further use information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 – Multilingualism – Recommendation 16). In addition, the country should work towards matching each base registry with appropriate metadata including the description of its content, service assurance and responsibilities, the type of master data it keeps, conditions of access and the relevant licences, terminology, a glossary, and information about any master data it uses frm other base registries (Base Registries – Recommendation 39). </p><p>Additional information on Portugal’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="img/32-558.png" alt="32-558.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc140676270"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Strategy for the Digital Transformation of Public Administration 2021–2026 </p><p>The Council for Information and Communication Technologies in Public Administration (CTIC) defined the Strategy for the Digital Transformation of Public Administration 2021-2026 and the corresponding Action Plan for the Digital Transformation of Public Administration 2021-2023, both published in September 2021 (<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/dre.pt/web/guest/home/-/dre/171096337/details/maximized__;!!DOxrgLBm!Wr04ZQRIy2G9mRWcJA1RLbXK7v8kV0kaqo4jTDefeN-For3GO8jaZ-HvOm_GRgG6426rUlJs0lIgOqaLiQ$">Resolution of the Council of Ministers nº 131/2021</a>).

Social Security is adopting this new concept to accelerate the internal services in the network edge and support working from home for a large number of remote users who adopt Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) technology to get secure access to the services and applications with the best user experience and highest security.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle">Gigabit Network</p><p>In order to ensure coverage of all households, in the national territory, with a Gigabit network by 2030, the government mandated the National Communications Authority (ANACOM) to:</p><ul><li>Collect up-to-date information on the coverage of very high capacity networks (VHCN), including information on plans of any undertaking to roll out broadband networks, including VHCN;</li><li>Designate the geographical areas without VHCN (“white areas”) based on the information collected; and</li><li>Prepare the proposals for the specifications of the tendering procedures to be carried out by the government for the installation, operation and maintenance of Gigabit networks in the identified areas.</li></ul><p>In what concerns the provision of mobile services, including broadband services to achieve Gigabit connectivity, the 5G auction regulation established coverage and network development obligations thus creating an environment that fosters the development of population's digital skills, economic growth, social inclusion, and the competitiveness of the country and all of its regions. </p><h3>GovTech</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Other Innovative Technologies </h3><p class="subtitle">Social Security - Process Automation and Mining </p><p>Social Security adopted the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology and implemented automation of several business processes, including European pensions forms E250/P5000 and special needs education forms. At present, it is starting to evaluate, by means of process mining, other business processes which could be automated. The use of these technologies aims to significantly reduce the process execution time, eliminate the backlog and free human resources to execute other processes.</p><p class="subtitle">Caixa Geral de Aposentações - Process Automation </p><p>Caixa Geral de Aposentações, I.P., uses Robotic Process Automation (RPA) technology to update scheme member personal data, namely to perform the re-enrolment of teachers, and to prevent external fraud, through automatic detection of illicit instances of pension and salary overlapping.</p><p class="subtitle">Caixa Geral de Aposentações - Digital Proof of Life </p><p>The electronic life proof for pensioners living abroad, which compares the biometric data of the image taken from the identification document and a real time video of the pensioner and replaces, in a much more convenient way, consular services.</p><p>Social Security - Video Attendance</p><p>Video Attendance is an innovative form of assistance that allows citizens to access social security services, regardless of their geographic location, residence status in the country or abroad, or mobility status. Having the characteristics of a personalised service, it guarantees the response to the same products made available in the face-to-face channel, including the delivery of documents and, additionally, makes it possible to accompany the customer in carrying out a service available online, promoting the use of Direct Social Security services. Videoconference assistance proved to be an efficient management factor of the service network resources, maximising and optimising it immediately and without allocation of resources and additional costs. This project won the Best Government Project Award at the 6<sup>th</sup> Edition of the Portugal Digital Awards in 2021.</p><p class="subtitle">Quantum Communication </p><p>The <a id="_Hlk129178935"></a>National Security Office (GNS) is involved in a Euro QCI project through the PTQCI Digital Europe Programme, which aims to establish the national initial instance of an ultra-secure quantum communications technology infrastructure, which will be a component of the larger Euro QCI project. While delivering the initial segments of such a network, this project will evolve, covering not only other areas of the country (namely Azores and Madeira through satellite links), but also cross-border connections, thus enlarging the European Union network based on this type of technology. The consortium that has been created to put this project forward is composed of several entities from industry, academia, and governmental agencies.</p><p><img src="img/32-707.png" alt="32-707.png" /></p><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p><h1><a id="_Toc140676273"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on Portugal’s responsible bodies for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-portugal">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2>National</h2><p class="subtitle">Secretary of State for Digitalisation and Administrative Modernisation</p><p>The <a href="https://www.portugal.gov.pt/pt/gc23/primeiro-ministro/secretarios-de-estado?i=digitalizacooedamodernizacooadministrativa">Secretary of State for Digitalisation and Administrative Modernization</a> is responsible for the modernisation of public administration and digital government, under the direct tutelage and guidance of the Prime Minister.</p><p class="subtitle">Administrative Modernisation Agency</p><p>Created in 2007, the <a href="http://www.ama.pt/">Administrative Modernisation Agency (AMA) </a>is the public institute in charge of digital government and administrative modernisation and simplification, under the superintendence and tutelage of the Secretary of State for Digitalisation and Administrative Modernisation.
