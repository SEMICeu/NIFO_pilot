However, Sweden reaches a lower performance in the area of interoperability governance with a score of 3. More specifically, the score of 1 for Sweden in Recommendation 20, stating that a holistic governance of interoperability activities should be ensured across administrative levels and sectors, the score of 2 in Recommendation 22, on public administrations’ use of a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assessing and selecting standards and specifications, lower the overall result in interoperability governance for Sweden.</p><p><img src="img/35-364.png" alt="35-364.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Sweden’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of all recommendations. In line with the European average, Sweden reaches the maximal score of 4 on the implementation of recommendations assessing open data, base registries and internal information sources and services. The high performance in external and information sources and services indicates that Swedish public administrations are effectively using external information sources and services while developing public services. In order to get a maximal score, Sweden could improve its catalogues of public services as well as increase the number of trust services to ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services. Lastly, Sweden could reach the European average in the implementation of the conceptual model itself by deciding on a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components, put in place and maintain the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining European public services (Recommendation 35).   </p><p>Additional information on Sweden’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The strategy explains how the digitalisation policy contributes to competitiveness, full employment, and economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development in the society. The strategy sets the focus on the government’s digitalisation policy.</p><p>To achieve the overall objective of Sweden of becoming a world leader in harnessing the opportunities of digital transformation, the strategy contains five goals: </p><ul><li><strong>Digital skills:</strong> enhancing citizens’ digital skills, so as to enable them to actively participate in the digital transformation;</li><li><strong>Digital security:</strong> increasing digital security, and thus citizens’ trust and confidence in using digital services;</li><li><strong>Digital innovation:</strong> fostering digital innovation by creating the competitive conditions for the development and spread of new or improved products and services of value to people and businesses;</li><li><strong>Digital leadership:</strong> improving digital leadership, which entails better governance, but also measurement and follow-up activities; and</li><li><strong>Digital infrastructure:</strong> reinforcing the digital infrastructure, such as broadband, which is crucial for transmitting data.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Digital First – A Basic Principle </p><p><a id="_Hlk37059209"></a>Digital first is a principle applied within the public sector. The government has made the assessment that <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/4ad5fb/contentassets/c689564aa19c4d29bcebb1c037a2e37b/utgiftsomrade-2-samhallsekonomi-och-finansforvaltning.pdf">digital should be the first choice</a> in public administration activities and in contacts with private individuals and businesses. Digital first means that the public administration, when appropriate, should choose digital solutions when designing its operations. At the same time, the protection of security-sensitive activities, the security of information and the protection of personal privacy must be ensured. With this in mind, getting in touch digitally with Swedish public authorities should be easy. Furthermore, information should only be provided once, if possible. The public administration should be effective, collaborate, and reuse information, tasks and common solutions whenever possible and appropriate. An <a href="https://www.digg.se/4aefd7/globalassets/dokument/publicerat/publikationer/sveriges-digitala-forvaltning-2020.pdf">analysis and assessment of the status of the digitisation of Sweden’s public administration</a> is published annually. </p><p class="subtitle">Putting the Citizen at the Centre - A Digital Services Strategy</p><p>The Swedish government strategy for collaborative digital services in government administration, ‘<a href="https://www.regeringen.se/informationsmaterial/2015/04/med-medborgaren-i-centrum/">Putting the Citizen at the Centre</a>’, was launched in December 2012. This strategy describes how the Swedish government plans to further strengthen the ability of government agencies to work together in delivering digital services. More common digital services in the daily lives of both citizens and businesses have been further simplified. These digital services shall be developed in a user-centric way: simple, secure to use and easily accessible to everyone. Innovation has been enhanced by making it easier to find and use reusable public information and digital services with interfaces that can be operated by other systems. The publication of public sector information on the internet and the use of social media have promoted both transparency and citizen involvement. Quality and efficiency in government administration have been increased through standardised information management, better information security and digitised processes. Such internal efficiency in developing digital services must always be conditional on the protection of personal privacy and the need for confidentiality. The above-mentioned objectives have formed the basis of the Swedish government’s coordinated and overriding development of inter‑agency cross-sectorial projects. </p><p class="subtitle">Development for the Digital Age - A New Strategy for Local and Regional Governments</p><p>In 2019, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) adopted a <a href="https://skr.se/naringslivarbetedigitalisering/digitalisering/strategifordigitalutveckling.6728.html">new strategy</a> for digital government, aiming to align efforts related to digital development in SALAR, the Swedish municipalities and regions, as well as in the SALAR groups Adda (formerly named <a href="https://www.sklkommentus.se/">SKL Kommentus</a>) and <a href="https://www.inera.se/">Inera AB</a>.

The strategy identifies a number of Swedish strategic priorities from a national, European and international perspective, and describes how they should be addressed through an active Swedish standardisation policy.</p><p>In addition, sector-specific priorities are described. These priorities have been identified through a mapping activity and standardisation analysis of the government and other relevant authorities. </p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk66907069"></a>Interoperable Data Exchange</p><p><a id="_Hlk37059773"></a>During the last years, the Swedish government has focused more on interoperability and standardisation, as demonstrated by the different government initiatives for standardised and interoperable information and data exchange. </p><p><a id="_Hlk8916116"></a>More specifically, two government initiatives were launched in May 2018, focusing on establishing the foundation for a more standardised and interoperable national approach to base registries and information exchange. Several key stakeholders were involved in the initiatives, including some of the larger government agencies and the Agency for Digital Government (DIGG), which had the responsibility to coordinate work. </p><p>The final reports for the initiatives were submitted in 2019. In line with the proposals in the reports, two new government initiatives were started at the end of 2019 with a view to establishing a <a href="https://www.digg.se/om-oss/regeringsuppdrag/pagaende-regeringsuppdrag/nationellt-ramverk-for-grunddata/">national framework for basic data</a> in public administration and a <a href="https://www.digg.se/om-oss/regeringsuppdrag/pagaende-regeringsuppdrag/gemensam-informationsutbyte">digital infrastructure for information exchange</a>. A long-term plan to that end was defined in 2020 and the first deliverables based on this plan were available in 2021.

It was developed by several government agencies in a collaboration programme called eSam and is now managed by the DIGG. </p><p class="subtitle">Standard Business Reporting</p><p>The Standard Business Reporting (SBR) is a methodology for digital exchange of structured business information whose basis consists of financial information. That way, the SBR, based on open standards to increase the availability of business data, creates business value through digitalised financial information.</p><p>In March 2021, the formal assignment to further develop the service for digital submission of annual reports (N2018 / 02033 / FF) was completed. The heads of the collaborating authorities, however, decided to continue working in a voluntary collaboration under the leadership of the Swedish Companies Registration Office with the aim of establishing the SBR in Sweden. The work is further based on the recommendations submitted to the government in the final report in March 2021. In 2022, the Swedish Companies Registration Office, together with the cooperating authorities, will work out a roadmap that extends to 2027. Collaboration will take place with the pan-Nordic programme Nordic Smart Government &amp; Business in order to ease and reduce the reporting burden for Swedish and Nordic companies with the help of structured and digitalised data. To that end, the SBR as a concept and methodology gives companies and authorities an increased opportunity for simplified exchange of financial information that originates in the companies’ accounting system.</p><p>In 2022, the possibility of setting up a regulatory sandbox will also be explored with the aim of testing new possibilities to increase automated and digitalised information exchange between companies and authorities.</p><h2><a id="_Hlk66389939"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a><a id="_Hlk66389848"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Initiative for Increasing Individuals’ Insight of and Control over Personal Information </p><p>In 2020, the Swedish government initiated an <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/regeringsuppdrag/2020/09/uppdrag-att-mojliggora-losningar-for-individen-till-kontroll-och-insyn-av-data-om-individen/">assignment</a> aimed at increasing individuals’ insight of and possible control over information about them available within public administration organisations.

More specifically, the programme has the following goals: </p><ul><li>Building secure and trusted electronic identification (eID) interoperability;</li><li>Promoting cross-border data exchange between authorities;</li><li>Enabling digital services across borders; and</li><li>Establishing an open funding mechanism (the CBDS Fund).</li></ul><p>Several projects are working on, e.g., developing the Nordic-Baltic eID (NOBID), enabling cross‑border digital services, including for studying abroad, and carrying out pilots in mapping and testing evidence exchange under the Single Digital Gateway Regulation. </p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk104794969"></a>eID for Employees</p><p>The possibility to use employee eIdentifications in external services outside of the employee’s organisation has been introduced in form of an agreement on the business terms and technical requirements. One of the most important features is the possibility to use an organisation’s specific identifier instead of the Swedish person identity number. This pseudonym decreases the risk of threats against employees. Other requirements and LoA (Level of Assurance) classification are the same. This means that the same trustframwork “Tillitsramverket för Svensk E-legitimation” (Only minor differences compared with eIDAS implementing act 2015:1502) and framework for interoperability “Technical Specifications for the Swedish eID Framework” is used for both ordinary eID and eID for employees.

The latest update of the <a href="https://www.msb.se/sv/publikationer/samlad-informations--och-cybersakerhetshandlingsplan-for-aren-20192022--redovisning-2020/">Comprehensive Cybersecurity Action Plan</a> was released and made publicly available on 2 March 2021.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle">References to the Once-Only Principle</p><p>Although the Once-Only principle (OOP) is not legally mandatory in Sweden, the Swedish national budget proposal for 2017 clearly referred to it and foresaw cases where it should be applied. From a Swedish perspective, the OOP means that an amount of data reported to an authority must, if possible, be reused before it is requested again. Managed by the DIGG, the OOP is also part of the Swedish Framework for Digital Collaboration (i.e. the Swedish version of the EIF). Additionally, a Swedish government committee has been in charge of developing further proposals and recommendations for the application of the OOP in Sweden as to the companies’ interactions with the public sector. It mainly proposes how coordination with regard to the OOP can be organised, and how a good and consistent description of the data requirement can be maintained.</p><p>Two government initiatives were launched in May 2018, focussing on establishing the foundation for a more standardised and interoperable national approach to base registries and information exchange. Several key stakeholders were involved, including some of the larger government agencies and the DIGG, which had the responsibility to coordinate the work. </p><p>The final reports for these initiatives were submitted in 2019. As envisioned in the reports, two new government initiatives were launched at the end of the same year with the aim of establishing a basic data national framework in public administration and a common digital management infrastructure for information exchange, for which an <a href="https://www.digg.se/4905d9/globalassets/dokument/publicerat/publikationer/delredovisning_etablera_nationellt_ramverk_for_grunddata_20210129.pdf">interim report</a> was published in 2021. The two initiatives will be implemented in 2022.</p><p>Furthermore, a number of Swedish authorities, mainly the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the Swedish Tax Agency and the Stockholm University, participated in the European large-scale pilot projects Once-Only Principle (OOP) and Digital Europe For All (DE4A), both exploring the OOP prior to the introduction of the Single Digital Gateway Regulation.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">Guidance from Central Government Authorities</p><p>The National Agency for Public Procurement provides guidance on eProcurement, eCommerce, the usage of dynamic purchasing systems and the sustainability analysis. The adopted method allows government agencies to focus their sustainability efforts on high impact categories. </p><p>The DIGG provides guidance on eProcurement and the use of the Peppol infrastructure and standards for post-award messages. The DIGG is the Swedish Peppol authority, leading the work on the national Peppol infrastructure and offering support primarily to service providers within Peppol but also to end users, like suppliers from the private sector and buyers in the public sector.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle">Vision for eHealth 2025</p><p>Digitisation offers great opportunities for the future of social services, health and medical care. Modern information and communication technologies (ICT) can make it easier for individuals to be involved in their own health and social care, support contact between individuals and service providers, and provide more efficient support systems for staff at service providers.</p><p>In 2016, the government and <a href="https://skr.se/tjanster/englishpages.411.html">SALAR</a> agreed on a <a href="https://ehalsa2025.se/english/">vision for eHealth</a>. This vision aims to provide support to make use of the opportunities of digitisation in social services and healthcare. In particular, a common vision for eHealth up to 2025 was endorsed. The vision says that <em>“[i]</em>n 2025, Sweden will be best in the world at using the opportunities offered by digitalisation and eHealth to make it easier for people to achieve good and equal health and welfare, and to develop and strengthen their own resources for increased independence and participation in the life of society<em>”.</em></p><p>A<a href="https://ehalsa2025.se/visionen/"> strategy for eHealth for the period of 2020–2022</a> has complemented the vision. The purpose of the strategy is to determine how the joint work of the government and SALAR should be designed and prioritised. The priorities identified are: (i) people awareness and involvement; (ii) safe and secure information; (iii) knowledge; (iv) digital transformation; and (v) collaboration. The government and SALAR will also work together on the legal framework and the consistent use of terminology and standards.<a id="_Hlk68684053"></a></p><p class="subtitle">Digitalisation of the Judiciary</p><p>Digitalisation can contribute to a judicial system which is well-functioning, efficient, based on rule of law and trusted by the people.

The network is also expected to become increasingly important for national crisis communication among Swedish government agencies. </p><p>The SGSI is an IP service, a virtual private network which has no direct connection with the open internet. According to the security target in force, the SGSI is used by accredited government agencies. Accreditation implies that case sensitive information which has been classified according to the EU Council’s security regulations as ‘Restreint UE’ can be transferred to TESTA and to connected agencies. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk99607540"></a>Secure Data Communication </p><p><a id="_Hlk99717601"></a>The infrastructure for secure digital communication is developed and operated by <a href="https://www.inera.se/">Inera AB</a>, owned by <a href="https://skr.se/tjanster/englishpages.411.html">SALAR</a>. Since March 2022 it is possible to connect to the infrastructure, which enables a safe exchange of information between authorities. The solution uses the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) eDelivery building block, i.e. the architecture for safe transport of information between entities that is provided by the DIGG. </p><p class="subtitle">Common Public Sector Digital Infrastructure for Information Exchange</p><p>The Swedish government is currently implementing a common digital infrastructure named Ena – The digital infrastructure of Sweden. The purpose is to strengthen the public sector’s ability to deliver efficient, secure and innovative digital services. The implementation is ongoing and described in a <a href="https://www.digg.se/publicerat/publikationer/2021/uppdrag-att-etablera-en-forvaltningsgemensam-digital-infrastruktur-for-informationsutbyte-samt-uppdrag-att-etablera-ett-nationellt-ramverk-for-grunddata-inom-den-offentliga-forvaltningen">report published on 1 December 2021. </a>Another <a href="https://www.digg.se/om-oss/regeringsuppdrag/avslutade-regeringsuppdrag/analys-om-forutsattningar-for-kommuners-och-regioners-deltagande-i-den-forvaltningsgemensamma-digitala-infrastrukturen/">report</a> analyses the prerequisites for the participation of municipalities and regions in the infrastructure.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a><a id="_Hlk66804984"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk97800121"></a>Official Electronic ID Card</p><p>In 2005, the Swedish government introduced the ‘official’ eID card containing biometric data. The new ‘national identity card’ (<em>nationellt identitetskort</em>) is not compulsory and does not replace previous paper ID cards. It can be used as proof of identity and citizenship, and as a valid travel document within the Schengen area. The card complies with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards for biometric travel documents; it is issued by passport offices and manufactured by the same supplier as the biometric passport. In addition to the contactless chip containing a digital picture of the holder, it also has a traditional chip, which may be used to securely access eGovernment services in the future. </p><p>Based on Regulation (EU) 2019/1157 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the security requirements for identity cards of Union citizens and residence documents include, e.g., fingerprint information.</p><p>Despite the fact that it can be read electronically, the card is not an eID that can be used in order to authenticate the user remotely. A study proposed to complement it with an eID according to eIDAS Level of Assurance High, but no decision has been made yet.</p><p class="subtitle">Non-Official eID Cards and Software-based eIDs (eLegitimation)</p><p>The supply of eIDs in Sweden goes through an open system whereby all suppliers issuing eIDs for private persons and fulfilling certain requirements are allowed to sign a contract with the public sector. Before the suppliers can be approved, the DIGG performs an audit. Therefore, Swedish citizens are using non-official eID cards or mobile/computer‑based eIDs issued by different providers, like the BankID (developed by the largest Swedish banks), Telia and Freja eID+, to access certain eGovernment services. </p><p>Any physical person with a Swedish personal identity number (a unique identification number for all registered residents in Sweden) and permanently living in Sweden can obtain an eID. Persons without person identity number or not permanently living in Sweden can prove their identity and obtain an eID only under specific circumstances. Physical persons can also get an eID from the organisation they work for. </p><p>The personal identity number is used as the identifier when the eID is used for an eService, while legal entities can have an organisational number as identifier. The same number can be used in certificates for authentication and signing. The certificates contain the name of the organisation and the organisational number, and may also include a URL. The contact person ordering organisational certificates must have an authorisation for this purpose from a person authorised to sign on behalf of his/her organisation. </p><p>Most actors in the public sector base their eServices on the SAML 2.0 standard, even though old eID schemes do not follow this standard. For this reason, most eServices rely on proxy identity providers (IdPs). This system has worked well but deviations from the standard in the implementation of proxy IdPs have become an obstacle for implementing cross-border authentications and for new suppliers that fulfil the standard.</p><p class="subtitle">eIDAS</p><p>Sweden has implemented the eIDAS infrastructure and has established communication with all notified countries which are also technically prepared to deliver identity assertions according to their notification (twelve at the moment). Moreover, about 190 agencies and municipalities have now integrated cross-border authentication among their eServices or have initiated the integration process. Most of the services, however, require that the eID assertion contains a Swedish identification number, which prevents users to take full advantage of the service.</p><p>Sweden has notified Freja eID+ and made it available for other Member States, but no Member State has established a connection yet.</p><p class="subtitle">Biometric Passports</p><p>In October 2005, Sweden became the second European country to start issuing biometric passports compliant with the standards recommended by <a href="https://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">ICAO</a>. The ePassport has a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) microchip embedded in its polycarbonate data page containing a digital photo and personal information in the form of a fingerprint photo, complying with Council Regulation (EC) No. 2252/2004 from October 2005. After the revision of the Passport Act in 2007, passports started including fingerprints as from June 2009. Swedish passports then had a second state-of-the-art revision in 2012, and additional features and cutting-edge technology will be integrated following the third revision of biometric travel documents in Sweden on 1 January 2022.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">eProcurement Virtual System</p><p>The central eProcurement authorities’ role consists in monitoring the supplied services and compliance with standards. In general, the Swedish government has not implemented a central electronic public procurement portal, as this is deliberately left up to private operators. Several privately owned and operated portals exist instead, some of which concentrate on public procurement.</p><p class="subtitle">Information on Coordinated Public Sector Framework Agreements</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kammarkollegiet.se/om-oss/organisation/statens-inkopscentral">National Procurement Services</a> offer a website, <a href="https://www.avropa.se/">avropa.se</a>, that serves as an information database on the different framework agreements which were procured centrally by the National Procurement Services. The portal contains information on framework agreements available to national authorities. In the field of IT and telecom, framework agreements are also available to Swedish municipalities and regions. An agency can thus use the information portal to locate the necessary information on a framework agreement, whereas the procurement process is further handled by the agency itself, either by electronic or traditional means.</p><p>Differently, general information on public procurement in Sweden is to be found at the website of the National Agency for Public Procurement. Furthermore, the National Agency for Public Procurement is involved in the pre-award phase of eTendering in Peppol, while the DIGG is active in the post-award phase. This means that Sweden has increased its effort to digitise the whole eProcurement process.</p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing Infrastructure and Standard</p><p>The European eInvoicing standard, EN 16931, is mandatory according to the <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-20181277-om-elektroniska-fakturor-till_sfs-2018-1277">Law on Electronic Invoices as a Result of Public Procurement</a> (2018), but the law permits agreements on the use of other formats. The DIGG recommends the use of Peppol BIS Billing 3, which is an implementation (CIUS) of EN 16931. According to the <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/forordning-2003770-om-statliga-myndigheters_sfs-2003-770">Ordinance for Electronic Information Exchange</a> (2003), central government authorities must support Peppol BIS Billing 3, but can also support a few older invoice formats in existing agreements. </p><p>The DIGG also recommends the use of the Peppol infrastructure for sending and receiving invoices as well as other eProcurement messages. The DIGG is the Peppol authority of Sweden, leading the work on the national Peppol infrastructure and offering support primarily to service providers within Peppol but also to end users, like suppliers from the private sector and buyers in the public sector.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">eKrona Project</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/"><em>Riksbank</em></a>, Sweden’s Central Bank, has the task of promoting a safe and efficient payment system, a task that may be more difficult in the future if cash is no longer used as a means of payment by the majority of households and companies. The <em>Riksbank</em> therefore needs to consider which role it should adopt in an increasingly digital world. In this context, Sweden started a project in the spring of 2017 to examine the possibility of issuing a new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the so-called <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/sv/betalningar--kontanter/e-krona/"><em>eKrona</em></a><em>.</em> An <em>eKrona</em> would give the general public access to a digital complement to cash whose value would be guaranteed by the government. At present, the <em>Riksbank</em> only offers digital money to banks and other RIX participants. </p><p>In order to increase the knowledge of the CBDC, since February 2020 the <em>Riksbank</em> has been running a proof of concept, the <em>eKrona</em> pilot, with a technical supplier (Accenture) to develop and test a platform based on distributed ledger and blockchain technology for an <em>eKrona</em> system in a limited test environment. The objective of the <em>eKrona</em> pilot is to learn more about the certain technology in particular and to investigate (technical, policy and legal) issues regarding an <em>eKrona</em> in general. The <em>Riksbank</em> ended the first phase of the proof of concept in the beginning of 2021 and has extended the agreement for one year to continue the development and evaluation of the platform.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle">Dela Digital: A Knowledge Sharing Platform for Municipalities and Regions</p><p><a href="https://deladigitalt.se/loggain?redirect=/delameddig">Dela Digital</a>, an open source platform, was developed by SALAR with a view to providing a possibility to share knowledge to all Swedish municipalities and regions. Through its user-driven setup, personnel and organisations can share experiences, from e.g. development projects, change processes and developed tools, that can improve work and cooperation within the public administration.</p><p class="subtitle">Network Open Source and Data</p><p>In the <a href="https://nosad.se/">Network Open Source and Data (NOSAD)</a>, public entities gather to share best practices and lessons learned through monthly workshops on subjects concerning innovation, open data and open source. In addition, they collaborate on community initiatives, such as a catalogue of open source software used within public services. The purpose is to inspire the public sector as to how to take the next step to promote innovation and maximize the effects of digitalisation using open data and open source. The network is organized by the Swedish Public Employment Service (Jobtech Development), the DIGG, SALAR and the Swedish Internet Foundation.</p><p class="subtitle"><em>Digitalhjälpen:</em> Increasing the Digital Competence among the Elderly</p><p>Particularly elderly persons face specific challenges to use the possibilities that digital services and tools offer, a matter that was made significantly acute by the 2020 COVID‑19 pandemic.

DE4A continues the development of the infrastructure initiated in the framework of TOOP. The project is ongoing and is expected to make its final delivery in January 2023. The Swedish authorities that participate in DE4A are the same as in TOOP, i.e. the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the Swedish Tax Agency and the Stockholm University.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information</p><p>Sweden too makes use of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=869">Electronic Exchange of Social Security Information (EESSI)</a>.
