These indicators are clustered within four main top-level benchmarks:</p><p><strong>User Centricity</strong> – indicates to what extent (information about) a service is provided online and how this is perceived.</p><p><strong>Transparency </strong>– indicates to what extent governments are transparent regarding: i) their own responsibilities and performance, ii) the process of service delivery and iii) personal data involved.</p><p><strong>Cross-Border Mobility</strong> – indicates to what extent EU citizens and businesses can use online services in another country.</p><p><strong>Key Enablers</strong> – indicates the extent to which five technical pre-conditions are available online. There are: Identification (eID), Electronic documents (eDocuments), Authoritative Sources, and Digital Post. Digital Post refers to the possibility that governments communicate electronically-only with citizens or entrepreneurs through e.g. personal mailboxes or other digital mail solutions.</p><p>These top-level benchmarks are measured using a life-events (e.g. mystery shopping) approach. Eight life events are included in the overall eGovernment performance score. Four of these life events were measured in 2013, 2015 and 2017 and the other four were measured in 2012, 2014, 2016, and again in 2018. The life events measured in 2017 were Regular business operations, Moving, Owning and driving a car and Starting a small claims procedure. The life events measured in 2018 are Business start-up, Losing and finding a job, Family life and Studying.</p><img src="img/5-62.png" alt="5-62.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/egovernment-benchmark-2018-digital-efforts-european-countries-are-visibly-paying">eGovernment Benchmark Report 2018 Country Factsheet </a></p><h1><a id="_Toc6911422"></a>Digital Government Highlights</h1><p class="subtitle">Digital Government Political Communications</p><p>The Government launched the programme <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/rada-vlady-pro-informacni-spolecnost.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Ng==">Digital</a> Czechia which covered three main concepts:</p><p>Czech Republic in Digital Europe;</p><p>Information Concept of the Czech Republic; and</p><p>Digital Economy and Society Concept.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Government Legislations</p><p>Various Digital Government legislations was amended in 2018: </p><p><a href="http://www.cms-lawnow.com/ealerts/2016/10/new-legislation-on-electronic-identification-and-authentication?cc_lang=en">Act on Electronic Identification</a>; </p><p><a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2017-195">Act on Citizen Identity Cards</a>; </p><p><a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2000-365">Act on Information Systems of Public Administration</a>;</p><p><a href="http://www.portal-vz.cz/cs/Jak-na-zadavani-verejnych-zakazek/Legislativa-a-Judikatura/Legislativa/Zakon-o-zadavani-verejnych-zakazek-a-jeho-provadeci-predpisy/Uplne-aktualni-zneni-zakona-o-zadavani-verejnych-zakazek">Act on Public Procurement</a></p><p><a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2009-111">Act on Base Registers</a>;</p><p><a href="https://www.ctu.eu/electronic-communications-act">Act on Electronic Communications and on Amendment to Certain Related Acts</a>;</p><p><a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2014-181">Act on Cyber Security</a>;</p><p><a href="https://www.zakonyprolidi.cz/cs/2011-372">Act on Health Services</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Government Governance</p><p>Mr. Jan Hamáček became the Minister of the Interior.</p><p>Mr. Karel Havlíček became the Minister of Industry and Trade.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Government Infrastructure</p><p>A new version of the <a href="https://gov.cz/obcan/">Public Administration Portal</a> was launched.</p><p>The <a href="https://obcan.portal.gov.cz/prihlaseni">Citizen’s Portal</a> was launched, offering over 80 eServices to citizens.</p><p>The next phase of <a href="https://nakit.cz/projekty-popis/">modernisation of the public administration communication infrastructure</a> took place, and its central element is the central place of services 2.0.</p><p>The eIDAS node was launched in September 2018 under the name <a href="http://peps.cz/">CZ.PEPS</a>.</p><p>Since 1 January 2019, all contracting authorities are obliged to accept incoming eInvoices in ISDOC/ISDOCX formats.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Government Services for Citizens and Businesses</p><p>Various new services are now available for citizens on the <a href="https://obcan.portal.gov.cz/prihlaseni">Citizen’s Portal</a>:</p><p>Reservation system for filing applications for ID cards and travel documents;</p><p>Services of the Czech Social Security Administration (access to pension data, etc.); </p><p>Criminal record; </p><p>Electronic submissions for financial management (VAT control reports, tax returns);</p><p>Driver’s ranking listing;</p><p>Access to a list of properties owned by the user (preview of the cadastre);</p><p>Access to the patient’s drug account (eRecept);</p><p>Information on incapacity for work;</p><p>National eHealth contact point;</p><p>Submission of a request for information.</p><p>New services for citizens are also accessible on the <a href="https://gov.cz/obcan/">Public Administration Portal</a>:</p><p>Application for birth allowance;</p><p>Application for parental allowance;</p><p>Application for child allowance.</p><p>The <a href="https://obcan.portal.gov.cz/prihlaseni">Citizen’s Portal</a> also made new services available for businesses:</p><p>Extract from the Trade Register;</p><p>A single registration form;</p><p>A non-public extract of the natural person’s business;</p><p>Extract from the list of qualified suppliers;</p><p>Extract from the insolvency register.</p><h1><a id="_Toc6911423"></a>Digital Government Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific political communications on digital government</h2><p class="subtitle">Digital Czechia</p><p>The Government Programme <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/rada-vlady-pro-informacni-spolecnost.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Ng==">Digital Czechia</a> focused on the Strategy of Coordinated and Comprehensive Digitisation of the Czech Republic 2018+.

This strategy of public administration development formulated four targets to be further elaborated by the Government Council and achieved within the six-year period. Specified priorities covered public administration modernisation, which included the evaluation of its current functioning, proposing and implementing performance improvement measures, improvement of services availability via eGovernment tools, and continuous human resources professionalisation and development.</p><p>The implementation of individual measures and activities leading to the implementation of both specific and strategic objectives was, to a certain extent, interconnected. </p><p>In respect of the strategic objective No. 1: the modernisation of the public administration, a key task was, to optimise and streamline the performance of individual (selected) agendas, primarily via their initial mapping and subsequent standardisation. These activities would, at the same time, contribute to the reduction of the regulatory burden. The established quality management systems and the system of public administration evaluation subsequently identified the potential for further optimisation of the public administration system. </p><p>Currently, there is a preparation of a new conceptual material for the development of public administration called <a href="http://www.dvs.cz/clanek.asp?id=6762365">Client Oriented Public Administration 2030</a>, which will follow the currently valid Strategic Framework for the Development of Public Administration in the Czech Republic for 2014-2020.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Digital Czechia and Strategic Framework of the Development of Public Administration in the Czech Republic </p><p>The Government Programme <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/rada-vlady-pro-informacni-spolecnost.aspx?q=Y2hudW09Ng==">Digital Czechia</a> follows and further elaborates the <a href="http://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAAahUKEwiphJvXuLzIAhVCahoKHexlDIQ&amp;url=http://www.mvcr.cz/soubor/eng-strategie-vlada-po-revizi-17-10-14-ii-pdf.aspx&amp;usg=AFQjCNFUlSuJcCpqdl2F9FI5wXFf9a-_ew">Strategic Framework of the Development of Public Administration in the Czech Republic for 2014 - 2020</a>. </p><p>Both strategic documents aim for the development of eGovernment.

Expert opinion must be actively collected and appropriately taken into account in the projects.</p><p>Before implementing new eHealth tools and services, their usability, quality, stability and performance must always be sufficiently validated and evaluated.</p><p>The introduction of e-health on the basis of a flat-rate obligation is in principle incorrect. When introducing new eHealth services and tools, positive motivation needs to be used, and new technologies introduced gradually and judiciously so as not to jeopardize the continuity and safety of operations, patient threats or deterioration of health professionals.</p><p>Wherever possible and useful, all available scientific knowledge and proven technologies, including standards for exchanging and displaying medical information, should be used to create new solutions.</p><p class="subtitle">Resort Strategy for eJustice Development </p><p>The <a href="https://www.databaze-strategie.cz/cz/ms/strategie/strategie-pro-rozvoj-elektronizace-justice-ejustice">strategy</a> is a long-term perspective for the area of eJustice.

It defined the rights and obligations of all persons and bodies involved in the development of Public Administration information systems. It further established the management framework concerned with the creation, use, operation and development of information systems. A first amendment to this Act was adopted in September 2007 by the Parliament with the aim to reduce excessive administrative burden for citizens through the Czech POINT network, through which the general public can obtain transcripts and information statements from the national registers. Furthermore, this amendment stated that all public authorities had to make their websites accessible for the disabled, thus incorporating eAccessibility into Czech legislation. </p><p>New provisions dealt with public administration systems’ governance, economic effectiveness and security. The Ministry of Interior now has the long-term ICT governance coordinator governor role as part of the Information conception of the Czech Republic, which was approved by the government. Several additional types of public administration internal operations systems were included under the category of “public administration information systems” regulated by law. These are, for example, information systems supporting public administration's HR management and remuneration, internal document management, accounting and email. </p><p class="subtitle">Act on Free Access to Information</p><p>An amendment to the <a href="https://www.portal.gov.cz/app/zakony/download?idBiblio=47807&amp;nr=106~2F1999~20Sb.&amp;ft=pdf">Act on Free Access to Information</a> (Act No. 106/1999 Coll.) was adopted by the Government on 12 May 2005 with a view to transpose the EU Directive <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0098:EN:HTML">2003/98/EC</a> on the re-use of public sector information (PSI Directive). This amendment set out the obligation for Public Administrations to provide online access to information in open data formats (e.g. XML). The amendment came into force on 1 January 2006. </p><p>This Act established the legal basis for the national open data catalogue as a “public administration information system” and the <a href="https://opendata.gov.cz/nastroj:narodni-katalog-otevrenych-dat">central national platform for public administration open data</a>. The catalogue is operated by the Ministry of Interior and more than 129,000 data sets have been already published. The Ministry of Interior provided guidelines for open data publication and cataloguing standards used by other public administrations at central, regional and local levels. </p><p>According to the Legislative Tasks Plan of the Government, the Ministry of the Interior elaborated the Draft of the change of the Act about free access to information. The Draft transposed the Directive of the European Parliament and Council 2013/37/EU from 26 June 2013 into the Czech legal order. The Draft contributed to a more effective publishing of public sector information and its reuse. This was due to the obligation of information publishing in open and, when possible, machine-readable data format, or through implementation of the agreement institution about the facilitating of permanent information access.</p><p>The Government of the Czech Republic approved this Draft on 14 January 2015 by Decree no. 17. It obliged the Minister of the Interior to elaborate the final wording of the governmental draft of the Act. The amendment was approved under Act No. 222/2015 Coll., reflecting recommendations and requirements of the European Union. The amendment to the Act went into effect on 10 September 2015. </p><p>An amendment of the Act No. 106/1999 Coll. on Free Access to Information was passed. This defined the national <a href="https://data.gov.cz/">open data catalogue</a> as a public administration information system and the central platform for open data in the Czech Republic. It defined public administration obligations for bodies to publish certain information as open data. The Government Regulation is under preparation, which will define the obligatory data sets list.

Detailed technical interoperability issues were solved via supporting documentation and guidelines provided by the National Registers Authority. </p><p>The latest amendment allowed private sector access to base registries’ data, under specific conditions. Prior to the amendment, only public administrations were given this access, based on the services that they are authorised to provide. The new legal provisions of the act also supported sharing and re-use of public administration systems at the national level, recommending the re-use of a single identification, authentication and authorisation solution used in central public administration systems known as JIP/KAAS. The law targeted the four base registries considered the cornerstones of the Czech eGovernment system, which were, according to Article 3, the Registry of Natural Persons (ROB), the Registry of Economic Entities (ROS), the Registry of Territorial Identification, Addresses and Real Estates (RUIAN) and the Registry of Rights and Duties (RPP). This law represented the legal basis for the National Registries Authority and sets out its principal activities. This organisation controlled access to base registries and kept records of entries.

NIA is a public administration information system supporting the process of electronic identification and authentication at the national level. NIA is a key tool for enabling electronic identity verification and forwarding of verified user information needed to use remote services. A separate part of the NIA is also the so-called eIDAS node, which facilitates interconnection to notified electronic identification systems (i.e. interconnects NIA with foreign notified systems of electronic identification).</p><p>The eIDAS node was launched on 28 September 2018 under the name <a href="https://www.nic.cz/files/nic/doc/ISSS_CZPEPS_042017.pdf">CZ.PEPS</a>. eIDAS nodes allow sign-ups between EU Member States for services provided in one Member State through an electronic identification mean issued in another Member State, subject to meeting the conditions of the eIDAS Regulation.

The Information System of Base Registries also publishes a catalogue of base registry services which is used for both the editing and reading performed by the Agenda Information Systems (AIS). Additionally, the mentioned Converter (ORG) is an information system which ensures the protection of personal data in base registries. To do so, it essentially administers all reference data in the individual registries in a way that makes it impossible to automatically link the reference data to information in other registries or between different agenda information systems.</p><h1><a id="_Toc6911427"></a>Digital Government Services for Citizens </h1><p>The information in this section presents an overview of the basic public services provided to the citizens.
