The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Switzerland in 2020.</p><img src="img/35-624.jpeg" alt="35-624.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020 </p><p>Switzerland’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF principles, despite a lack of data for the Principle 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Switzerland scores above the European average on Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and meets the European average for every other principle, with the exception of Principle 6 (User-centricity) with a medium score of 3 and Principle 11 (Preservation of information) which scores a 1. In order to meet the European average on these two principles, Switzerland’s public administration could favour relevant information and authentic sources while developing user-centric public services (Principle 6 – Recommendation 13) and formulate a long-term preservation policy for information related to European public services, especially for cross-border information (Principle 11 – Recommendation 18). </p><img src="img/35-625.jpeg" alt="35-625.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020 </p><p>The Swiss results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed in Scoreboard 2 are limited as the data is missing for tree interoperability layers (Interoperability governance, Legal interoperability and Organisational interoperability). Switzerland meets the European average on the layers dedicated to integrated public service governance, as well as technical interoperability, with a score of 4 for both layers. However, the Swiss score of 3 for the semantic interoperability layer is below the European average. To increase this score, Switzerland’s public administrations could enhance their support in the establishment of sector-specific and cross-sectoral communities that aim to create open information specifications and encourage relevant communities to share their results on national and European platforms (Recommendation 32). </p><p><br />Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020 </p><img src="img/35-626.jpeg" alt="35-626.jpeg" /><p>Switzerland’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a medium to low performance in the implementation of all recommendations. Despite the lack of data for the implementation of recommendations regarding bases registries and security and privacy, Switzerland reaches scores of 3 and 4, aligned with the EU average, on the implementation of recommendations assessing open data, catalogues and internal information sources and services. For the conceptual model and external information sources and services, Switzerland reaches a score of 2, lower than the European average indicating that Swiss public administrations could improve their use of the conceptual model for European public services proposed by EIF to design new services or reengineer existing ones and reuse, whenever possible, existing service and data components (Recommendation 34), as well as to decide on a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components and put in place and maintain the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining European public services (Recommendation 35). Another area of improvement is the Swiss’s use of external information sources and services while developing public services (Recommendation 45).   </p><p>Additional information on Switzerland’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through interactive dashboards.  </p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity</strong>: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong>: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services</strong>: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers</strong>: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

In general, the revision strengthens competition and makes procurement processes more flexible and modern. Important innovations are (i) the strengthening of sustainability and the prevention of corruption; (ii) the principle of quality competition instead of price competition; (iii) the expansion of legal protection; (iv) the modification of language standards, framework agreements, electronic procurement and electronic auctions; and (v) shorter deadlines.  </p><p class="subtitle">Opendata.swiss</p><p><a href="https://opendata.swiss/fr/">Opendata.swiss</a> is the Swiss public administration’s central portal for open government data. The portal is managed and was developed as part of the Open Government Data Strategy in Switzerland for the period 2019–2023 to target both citizens and businesses.</p><p class="subtitle">EasyGov.swiss</p><p><a href="https://www.easygov.swiss/easygov/#/">EasyGov</a>.swiss is a secure and reliable platform which allows companies to electronically process authorisation, application and reporting procedures from a single location. On the platform, companies can manage all the administrative procedures offered via a single account (single sign-on) with uniform user guidance. Private service providers, such as fiduciaries or notaries, can also use EasyGov.swiss to handle official matters on behalf of a company. Regularly required company data, such as the commercial registry number or address data, need to be entered only once or can be imported from registers (Once-Only principle). </p><p>This portal relieves and saves costs – both for companies and the authorities. Version1.0 of the EasyGov.swiss platform was launched on 6 November 2017. By the end of 2018, 21 government services were available on the portal, with more than 9 000 registrations. The most sought‑after authority services are available since the end of 2019. The platform currently provides the following authority services:</p><ul><li>Company foundation;</li><li>Registration with the old-age and survivors’ insurance, VAT and accident insurance; and</li><li>Registration and changes to the Commercial Registry.</li></ul><p>By the end of 2019, the platform also expanded its online services to include the following: <a href="https://www.seco.admin.ch/seco/en/home/seco/nsb-news/medienmitteilungen-2018.msg-id-75676.html">submissions to Debt Enforcement Offices</a> and <a href="https://www.seco.admin.ch/seco/en/home/seco/nsb-news/medienmitteilungen-2018.msg-id-77345.html">salary data entry</a> for salary declarations. The number of services provided will be extended in the coming years.</p><p>EasyGov.swiss works through guided dialogue with questions and entered responses. The approximate duration of an application or amendment is displayed at the beginning. Once logged in, the cockpit gives an overview of all the administrative procedures the user has already dealt with for his/her company on EasyGov.swiss. It also gives information on processes completed and those that are still being processed. The use of EasyGov.swiss is free. However, subsequent costs may arise, for example an entry fee for the Commercial Registry, VAT on turnover or social security contribution percentages on revenue. </p><p class="subtitle">VAT Transactions Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://www.estv.admin.ch/estv/en/home/mehrwertsteuer/dienstleistungen/mwst-abrechnung-online.html">VAT Transactions Portal</a> allows online deadline extensions, requests for settlement of accounts according to received fees, statements of subordination and balance tax rate methods, for exclusive use of businesses.</p><p class="subtitle">Online Desk for Swiss Nationals Residing Abroad</p><p>With the <a href="https://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/services-and-publications/dienstleistungen-schweizer-ausland/online-schalter.html">Online Desk</a>, Swiss nationals residing abroad have the possibility to access consular services, such as registering in the Swiss Abroad Registry, notifications of changes of civil status, changes of address, etc. It aims to reach citizens and businesses.</p><p class="subtitle">eMovingCH </p><p>The aim of this implementation objective is to enable the electronic reporting and processing of changes of address within Switzerland. <a href="https://www.egovernment.ch/en/umsetzung/schwerpunktplan/e-umzug-schweiz/">eMovingCH</a> is already in use in several cantons and their municipalities.

At that time, the cantons had two eVoting systems they could choose: that of the canton of Geneva and that of Swiss Post. Based on its decision of November 2018, the canton of Geneva announced in June 2019 that its system would no longer be available with immediate effect. In addition, Swiss Post announced on 5 July 2019 that its individually verifiable system would no longer be available to the cantons. </p><p>The Federal Council instructed the Federal Chancellery to plan a reorientation of the eVoting trial with the cantons by the end of 2020. The aim was to establish a stable trial operation using the latest generation of systems. This includes the further development of systems, the expansion of independent controls, the strengthening of transparency and trust, as well as increased scientific involvement. Starting from December 2020, after a redesign of the trial phase, <a href="https://www.bk.admin.ch/bk/en/home/dokumentation/medienmitteilungen.msg-id-81772.html">cantons are again permitted to run limited trials</a> with online voting.</p><p class="subtitle">eVAT</p><p>As of 1 January 2021, there are two options for settling VAT online: the <a href="https://www.estv.admin.ch/estv/de/home/estv-suissetax/estv-suissetax.html">ESTV SuisseTax Portal</a> and the <a href="https://mwsteasy.estv.admin.ch/login">‘VAT invoicing easy’</a> service. In accordance with the eGovernment Strategy, they will replace paper-based accounting. ESTV SuisseTax is the full online version of the service with all the functionalities currently available. More than 60% of taxable persons already use this option successfully. ‘VAT invoicing easy’ is the new online service using a simplified online form, without individual account and with a simple registration. In addition, tax representatives may optionally make use of a declaration approval, i.e. a document that the taxable person signs - for the acceptance of the tax representative’s declaration submitted electronically - and sends to the Federal Tax Administration by mail.</p><p class="subtitle">Creation of National Address Services</p><p>As the current procedure for obtaining specific addresses from other authorities is cumbersome, access to eGovernment services in the field will be further developed and facilitated in an optimal manner for the stakeholders.

The five cantons came together to form a community offering access to patients’ electronic files. They have put a common eHealth platform at the disposal of healthcare providers and their population, with a potential pool of two million people. The cantons of Geneva and Vaud cooperated with the Post Office and entrusted the technical implementation to all the member cantons.

The new SwissID did not replace SuisseID, which will remain available as a product until the end of 2021. Nothing changed for SuisseID users; they can still use their old ID as before. The functionalities of the two services are complementary. In the medium term, however, SuisseID will be incorporated into SwissID.</p><p>In Switzerland, other forms of electronic identity are also available:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.mobileid.ch/en">Mobile ID</a> is a joint solution of various Swiss mobile service providers and allows two-factor authentication.
