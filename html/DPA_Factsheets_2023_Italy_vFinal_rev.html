The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-803.png" alt="P84#yIS1" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Italy in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-808.x-emf" alt="P87#yIS1" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Italy shows a good performance in the implementation of the recommendations related to Scoreboard 1. Particularly, Italy scores as high as the EU average in almost all the principles. Moreover, compared to its performance in 2021, the country improved its performance in Principle 3 – Transparency and Principle 12 - Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency. Nevertheless, Italy can further improve the implementation of the recommendations associated with these principles as it scores still below the EU average. Particularly, additional efforts could be aimed to ensure internal visibility and provide external interfaces for European public services (Recommendation 5) and to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits (Recommendation 19). Concerning Principle 6 - User-centricity, it is worth noting that Italy shows a decrease of the performance compared to the previous year. Such reduction will need to be further monitored with the results of 2023.</p><p><img src="img/32-811.x-emf" alt="P92#yIS1" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Italian results for the implementation of the recommendations related to the interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall high performance, scoring 4, and at the European average, in all the layers. While already reporting a high performance in the interoperability governance layer, Italy has margins for further improvement in relation to ensuring a holistic governance of interoperability activities across administrative levels and sectors. (Recommendation 20).</p><p><img src="img/32-814.x-emf" alt="P96#yIS1" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The performance of Italy concerning the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 shows an overall good score in the implementation of all the seven indicators. Particularly, Italy scores higher than the EU average in External information sources and services as well as Security and Privacy. On the other hand, Italy has margins for improvement in relation to three indicators the Conceptual model and Catalogues. In this regard, the Italian score could be further improved by putting in place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions and use common models for describing them. (Recommendation 44) and, particularly, by deciding on a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components and put in place and maintain the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining European public services (Recommendation 35) where Italy has still a lower performance. </p><p><img src="img/32-816.x-emf" alt="P100#yIS1" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Italian performance concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at least upper-middle performance of the country in 15 indicators. Italy has a high performance in several principles (i.e. e.g. Openness, Reusability and Technological neutrality and data portability – Cross border) as well as in the implementation of several cross boarder indicators (i.e. technical and semantic interoperability). However, Italy has still margin for improvement in the implementation of several recommendations. For instance, efforts could focus on providing a single point of contact in order to hide internal administrative complexity and facilitate users’ access to European public services (i.e. Recommendation 11) and on simplifying processes and using digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users’ requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens.

The following measures will be put in place by 2026: </p><ul><li>Reinforcing the use of existing national platforms such as PagoPA, which enables transactions from and toward the public administration, and of the mobile application App IO, a unique point of access to many services for citizens; </li><li>Introducing the Single Digital Notification Platform, which allows to send digital notifications with legal value; and     </li><li>Strengthening the Italian Digital Identity System: SPID (Public Digital Identity System) and CIE (Electronic Identity Card), converging toward an integrated and user-centric solution and increasing the number of digital public services accessible through it; improving user experience and accessibility; harmonising different public administration practices toward high-quality standards.</li></ul><p><strong>Objective 2: Digital Skills</strong></p><p>The digitalisation of public services and infrastructures is reinforced by measures promoting the development of citizens’ digital skills and ensuring solid and pervasive digital literacy. More traditional investments in education programmes, platforms and infrastructure that cover the entire educational cycles of citizens are foreseen. Beside those, the Digital Civil Service (youth volunteering programme) and the Digital Facilitation Services will allow three million citizens to develop basic digital skills, therefore bridging the digital divide.</p><p><strong>Objective 3: Cloud and Infrastructure </strong></p><p>The digital transition of public administration follows a cloud-first approach that is oriented toward the migration of single administrations’ data and software in a cloud environment. This process will consolidate and rationalise many existing data centres, starting from those that do not fulfil the minimum safety, reliability and efficiency requirements (95% of the 11 000 data centres used by public administrations). Two alternative models are envisaged for central administrations: i) migration toward the National Strategic Pole (<em>Polo Strategico Nazionale</em> – PSN) with a new strategic cloud infrastructure, hybrid or private; or ii) migration toward the public cloud of a certified market operator. In addition, Italy will put in place a programme supporting and incentivising the migration of local public administrations to the cloud. </p><p><strong>Objective 4: Digital Online Services</strong></p><p>At the basis of public administration digitalisation lies the architecture and interconnection of administrations’ databases, which contribute to save time and resources for citizens and enterprises. The full interoperability of public administrations’ databases will extend the use of digital identity and digital domicile. The <a href="https://www.pagopa.it/it/prodotti-e-servizi/piattaforma-digitale-nazionale-dati">National Digital Data Platform</a> (PDND) will allow for the creation of a unique digital profile, following the Once-Only-principle, and will guarantee the interoperability of public sector information through a central catalogue of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) shared across central and local administrations. Public and private entities will be able to use the published APIs (eServices) in an authorised and certified way, in compliance with EU privacy laws. These eServices will enable the harmonisation with other EU countries of the service procedures prioritised by the Single Digital Gateway Directive. Semantic and syntactic interoperability of the eServices will be supported by the <a href="https://www.schema.gov.it/">National Data Catalogue for Semantic Interoperability</a> (NDC). </p><p><strong>Objective 5: Ultrafast Networks</strong></p><p>To comply with the Gigabit society’s promise of high-quality fixed and mobile connectivity infrastructures, a technology-neutral approach will be adopted. Therefore, Italy plans to put in place the following:</p><ul><li>1G Italy (<em>Italia a 1 Giga</em>): 1 Gbps connectivity to 8,5 million families, agencies and enterprises in grey, black, market failure and remote areas;</li><li>Connected School (<em>Scuola Connessa</em>): 1 fibre Gbps connectivity to 9 000 remaining schools;</li><li>Connected Health (<em>Sanità Connessa</em>): from 1 to 10 Gbps connectivity to 12 000 National Health System (<em>Servizio Sanitario Nazionale</em> - SSN) centres;</li><li>Small Islands Plan (<em>Piano Isole Minori</em>): submarine fibre backhauling to 18 small islands; and</li><li>5G Italy (<em>Italia 5G</em>): developing 5G infrastructure in mobile areas at market failure (only 3G available, no 4G or 5G investments planned).</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Three-Year Plan for IT in the Public Administration </p><p>The <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/">Three-Year Plan for IT in the Public Administration</a> was defined in accordance with the <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/en/faqs/">Digital Growth Strategy</a>, with the aim of setting public sector ICT investment targets in line with government guidelines and European goals and programmes. The plan proposes a systematic, distributed and shared management and use model applicable to the most innovative digital technologies. This approach is to be characterised by an agile and evolutionary management style, based on clear governance of all levels of public administration. The synergy and balance between the three pillars (innovative technologies, agile management style and clear and effective model of governance) ensure the country can benefit more effectively from new technologies and can provide citizens with an advantage in terms of easy access and improved digital services. The <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/">Agency for Digital Italy </a>(<em>Agenzia per l’Italia Digitale</em> - AgID) oversees the plan and coordinates the support to central and local public administration bodies in the implementation of the plan.</p><p>In October 2021, the Department for Digital Transformation (DTD) and AgID published a new version of the <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/it/agenzia/piano-triennale">Three-Year Plan for IT in the Public Administration</a> (2021-2023). The new plan, which represents the natural evolution of the previous three plans, is an important instrument to foster digital transformation in the country, particularly when considering the digitalisation of public administration. The fourth plan will focus on the implementation of the actions outlined in the previous plans, while monitoring the results that have been achieved to date. Additionally, the updated plan puts forward some new elements related to the NRRP and the supervision of the digital transformation targets for the public administration at all levels. The plan has three main objectives:</p><ul><li>The development of a digital society where digital services put citizens and businesses at the centre;</li><li>The promotion of ethical and inclusive development; and</li><li>The spread of new digital technologies within the Italian productive ecosystem while fostering standardisation, innovation and experimentation in the provision of public services.</li></ul><p><img src="img/32-821.png" alt="P179#y1" />In January 2023, the DTD and AgID published an updated version of the <a href="https://innovazione.gov.it/notizie/articoli/pubblicata-l-edizione-2022-del-piano-triennale-per-l-informatica-nella-pa/">Three-Year Plan for IT in the Public Administration (2022-2024).</a> This new version of the plan further integrates the NRRP within the objectives of the plan, recognising the unprecedented opportunity to foster the digital transformation of the Italian public administration. For instance, the updated plan refers to the targets and streams of action as well as the investments set by the NRRP.     </p><p class="subtitle">Cloud Strategy </p><p>In September 2021, together with the National Agency for Cybersecurity, the DTD published the <a href="https://innovazione.gov.it/progetti/infrastrutture-digitali-e-cloud/">Italian Cloud Strategy</a> (<em>Cloud Italia</em>), which sets out the path for public administrations, including local ones, to move to the cloud. The target is for 75% of Italian public administrations to migrate to the cloud by 2026.</p><p>Promoting the adoption of secure, efficient, sustainable and reliable data processing infrastructures, the strategy aims to overcome a long-standing weakness of the Italian public administration. At the core of the approach lies the identification of risks associated to different public data and service types and the most suitable cloud delivery modes (public, hybrid or private) to mitigate those risks. </p><p>The strategy is structured along the following lines: </p><ul><li>Certification process of cloud services: the objective is to provide an ex-ante certification scheme for cloud services that can be purchased by the public administration while ensuring that these services are in line with the necessary requirements of security, reliability and compliance with the relevant regulations and the country’s national interest;</li><li>The development of a taxonomy to classify data and services managed by public administrations: data and services can be classified as ‘strategic’, ‘critical’, or ‘ordinary’ depending on the potential threats they would likely pose to the country if they were to be compromised. Based on this taxonomy the most appropriate cloud delivery mode will be selected; and</li><li>The creation of the <a href="https://innovazione.gov.it/dipartimento/focus/polo-strategico-nazionale/#il-progetto-di-creazione-del-psn">National Strategic Hub</a> (NSH – <em>Polo Strategico Nazionale</em>):a national data processing infrastructure for hosting cloud services for ‘strategic’ and ‘critical’ public administrations’ data, across interconnected data centres, geographically distributed throughout the country. The NSH should ensure the highest levels of reliability, resilience and independence for the storage of critical public administrations’ data. Since January 2023, the National Cybersecurity Agency has taken over the responsibility for the qualification of cloud services for the public sector.      </li></ul><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and the Value-based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Italian government signed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and the Value-based Digital Government</a>, thus reaffirming its commitment – together with other EU Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">IT National Interoperability Framework </p><p>In 2021, Italy published the <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/it/infrastrutture/sistema-pubblico-connettivita/il-nuovo-modello-interoperabilita">new IT National Interoperability Framework</a>. The new framework aims to promote the creation of new user-centric, mobile first, digital public services based on secure and interoperable REST APIs. The goal is achieved by addressing both technological and organisational issues, especially those related to data-sharing hurdles between agencies. </p><p>Accordingly, with <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/547_dt_dg_n_547_1_ott_2021_adozione_lg_interoperabilit_tecnica_e_sicurezza.pdf">Decision No. 547/2021</a>, AgID adopted and published the ‘Guidelines on Technical Interoperability of the Public Administration' as well as the ‘Technologies and Standards Guidelines for Interoperability Security through the APIs of IT Systems’, pursuant to Article 71 of the Digital Administration Code (CAD) and to Directive (EU) 2015/1535. The <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/linee_guida_interoperabilit_tecnica_pa.pdf">guidelines</a> contribute to the definition of the ’Interoperability Model for the Public Administration’ (<em>Modello di Interoperabilità della Pubblica Amministrazione</em> - ModI), defined by AgID pursuant to Article 73 (3a), letter b of the CAD, in line with the new European Interoperability Framework. The first document focuses on technologies and how they are used to ensure secure digital transactions between and towards public administration bodies that use application programming interfaces via an IT connection network. The second identifies the technologies and standards that the public administration must take into account when creating their IT systems, in order to allow data and IT coordination between central, regional and local administrations, as well as between national and Union systems and with the managers of public services and private entities. To facilitate the creation of cross-border digital services, Italy worked in close connection with global standard-defining organisations - such as the Internet Engineering Task Force - and with other European Member States and the European Commission to identify and define standards supporting the creation of innovative digital services.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key Enablers</h2><h3> Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>Fifth National Action Plan for Open Government </p><p>In February 2022, Italy published an updated <a href="https://open.gov.it/en/open-government/national-plan/5nap#documents">Action Plan for Open Government</a>, which outlines nine commitments that were identified by the public administration and civil society as priorities during the co-creation process. These commitments focus on: (i) developing an open government strategy and governance structure; (ii) promoting integrity and preventing corruption; (iii) strengthening civil society participation; (iv) promoting engagement with women and young people; and (v) enabling digital innovation.</p><p>While the thematic areas developed in the previous action plans remain relevant (e.g., networks for integrity and transparency, support for whistle-blowers and open standards), the new areas do not directly stem from the commitments of the fourth action plan.</p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-824.png" alt="P198#y1" />Design guidelines for public administration websites and digital services</p><p>In July 2022, the DTD published the <a href="https://docs.italia.it/italia/design/lg-design-servizi-web/it/versione-corrente/index.html">Design Guidelines and Manual</a> (<em>Linee guida e manuale operativo di design)</em>. The guidelines describe all the features to be included when creating websites and digital services for the public sector, the optional requirements as well as those requiring careful evaluation. In addition, the guidelines contain references to information transparency and security, the integration of enabling platforms, licences and good service monitoring practices. With the aim of fostering digital adoption within the society, the guidelines focus on the importance of creating websites and digital services that are useful and easy to use, following a user-centred design methodology.                </p><p>Furthermore, an evaluation app has been created to support the public administration when designing and developing their webpages. The app is an automated tool to help verify the correct adherence to the design models for municipalities and schools. It helps to evaluate the quality of the website and the compliance with the criteria of measure 1.4.1 of the NRRP (‘Citizen experience in digital public services’), both during and after development. The design models enable the creation of institutional websites and digital services already validated by research and designed responding to the needs of citizens.

The document describes the strategic programme, the implementation, and the supervision of cloud technologies in the public administration. The strategy builds upon three main areas of intervention, namely: (i) the creation of a national infrastructure for the provision of cloud services that will be set up and operate without any influence from extra-EU public and private actors; (ii) a qualification process for public cloud providers and their services to ensure that the declared characteristics and service levels are in line with the necessary requirements of security, reliability and compliance with relevant national and EU regulations; and (iii) the development of a methodology for classifying data and services managed by public administrations, to allow them to be migrated to the most appropriate Cloud solution (PSN or qualified public Cloud). </p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.     </p><h3>High-performance Computing</h3><p class="subtitle">Framework Partnership Agreement</p><p>At the end of 2022, MIMIT published a new call within the Framework Partnership Agreement (FPA) for developing a large-scale European initiative for a High-Performance Computing (HPC) ecosystem based on <a href="https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/new-call-developing-hpc-ecosystem-based-risc-v-2023-02-01_en">RISC-V</a>.

As <a href="https://www.mimit.gov.it/it/incentivi/calcolo-ad-alte-prestazioni-euro-hpc">announced</a>, 40% of the total funding is reserved for enterprises in the southern regions.      </p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle">1G Italy Plan</p><p>The 1G Italy plan aims to provide about seven million street addresses with at least one Gbps download and 200 Mbps upload capacity under usual peak-time conditions, in compliance with the principle of technological neutrality. In particular, the measure, with a budget of approximately EUR 3.7 billion, aims at covering the real estate units that, according to the mapping exercise conducted, have not been covered by networks capable of providing at least 300 Mbps download speed under usual peak-time conditions.</p><p>The government, in compliance with the rules defined by the EU legislation on State aid, must ensure that public intervention is limited to market failure NGA areas, i.e., those where there are no infrastructures capable of reaching, in reasonable times, the connectivity performance of 300 Mbps download speed under usual peak-time conditions that is necessary to meet user needs, as defined in the strategy. Therefore, the government must ensure that public investments do not overlap with the private investment plans already envisaged by operators. The first step in defining the exact scope of intervention under the 1G Italy plan was updating the mapping exercise concerning the ultrabroadband fixed networks in grey and black areas as well as in the so called 2016 white areas. The outcome of the mapping was shared with the stakeholders as part of the public consultation in which the target areas, as well as the other characteristics of the measure, were precisely indicated, including the public intervention model.</p><p>In January 2022, the request for State aid was approved, and the tenders for the realisation of the networks were launched. The deadline for awarding the tender was 30 June 2022. After the award, the first households will start being connected according to the service requirements mentioned above.</p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-833.png" alt="P274#y1" />Small Islands Plan </p><p>The <a href="https://www.mimit.gov.it/index.php/it/notizie-stampa/banda-ultralarga-al-via-il-piano-per-isole-minori">Small Islands Plan</a> (<em>Piano Isole Minori)</em> aims to implement optical backhaul in the small islands by laying submarine optical cables in the regions of Lazio, Puglia, Sicily, Tuscany and Sardinia, reaching a total of 21 islands which currently do not have any fibre connections. Optical backhaul will enable the development of ultrawideband, increase coverage of mobile radio networks while fostering the evolution to 5G services. The new network will be publicly owned and will ensure connection to the 21 islands currently without fibre connections on fair and non-discriminatory terms. The work is to be completed by 31 December 2023.</p><p class="subtitle">5G Italy Plan     </p><p>The 5G Italy plan was designed to better address public initiatives aimed at the creation of networks able to provide innovative and high-performance mobile services. The plan is complementary and synergetic to the already-started national 5G networks development plan and to the coverage obligations of mobile radio operators, in compliance with the constraints imposed by the rules on State aid. The plan aims to encourage the development of 5G mobile networks to fully satisfy the needs for a mobile connectivity that can enable the multiple use cases envisaged by the ITU, related to three categories, namely: (i) enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB); (ii) massive Machine Type Communication (m-MTC); and (iii) and Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC).</p><p>To this end, the plan envisages two distinct and complementary lines of action: a) the implementation of fibre optic backhauling for mobile base stations that, based on the plans declared by the operators during the mapping stage, will not have fibre backhauling by 2026; b) the implementation of new network infrastructures providing mobile radio services with adequate performance to satisfy user needs in areas where, on the basis of the mapping exercise, the downlink speeds expected by 2026 is less than 30 Mbps under usual peak-time conditions.</p><h3>GovTech</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><p><img src="img/32-836.png" alt="P284#y1" /></p><p>3</p><p>Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><h1><a id="_Toc140674464"></a>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474962"></a><img src="img/32-839.png" alt="P287#y1" />Specific Legislation on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Decree No. 13/2023</p><p>The Governance and Simplification Decree (<a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2023/02/24/23G00022/sg">Decree No. 13/2023</a>) introduces a new provision in the Code of Civil Procedure (Article 35, session 3, modifying Article 196 <em>quarter</em>).

The infrastructure is intended for use by all public administrations. The objective of the PSN is to host the critical and strategic data and services of all central administrations (about 200), local health authorities, and the main local administrations (regions, metropolitan cities, municipalities with more than 250 000 inhabitants).</p><p>The PSN aims at accelerating the digital transformation of public administrations and aims to bring 75% of Italian administrations to use cloud services by 2026. The NRRP provides funding for central administrations, health agencies, and major local administrations to migrate data and services to the National Strategic Pole. The PSN is one of the three pillars of the Cloud Italia Strategy, together with the classification of public data and services by the Agency for National Cybersecurity (ACN) and the migration to the cloud of data and services of the public administration.</p><p>On 21 December 2022, the DTD formalized the creation of the infrastructure through the award agreement stipulated with the company Polo Strategico Nazionale S.p.A., owned by TIM, Leonardo, the development bank ‘<em>Cassa Depositi e Prestiti’</em> (through the subsidiary CDP Equity) and SOGEI. This represented a crucial step for the deployment of a highly-reliable cloud infrastructure that will host the Italian public administrations’ critical and strategic data and services. To date, at least 280 Central Public Administrations and ASL have already migrated to PSN. The migration to PSN can be executed in different ways depending on the state of art of on-premises software’s IT architecture owned by each migrating public administration. These strategies can vary from pure hosting and lift-and-shift migrations for not cloud-ready software to a migration to IaaS, PaaS and SaaS for cloud-ready software. The PSN shall offer to each migrating public administration all the migration strategies that are eligible to consider the target migration to the PSN achieved.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h3>Govtech</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><p><img src="img/32-857.png" alt="P544#y2" /></p><p>5</p><p>Digital Public Administration Governance </p><h1><a id="_Toc140674466"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on Italy’s responsible bodies for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-italy">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474973"></a><img src="img/32-860.png" alt="P550#y1" />National </h2><p class="subtitle">Undersecretary for Technological Innovation </p><p>The Undersecretary for Technological Innovation, within the Prime Minister’s Office, oversees the coordination of eGovernment tasks at all levels of the Italian administration.
