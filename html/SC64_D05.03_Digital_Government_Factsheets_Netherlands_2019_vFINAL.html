Four system services support the base registers in their aim to disclose their catalogue of products and services to users in a uniform way. The system of base registers identifies the following system services: D<a href="https://www.logius.nl/diensten/digikoppeling">igikoppeling</a>, <a href="https://www.logius.nl/diensten/digilevering">Digilevering</a>, <a href="https://www.logius.nl/diensten/digimelding/">Digimelding</a>, and the <a href="https://www.logius.nl/diensten/stelselcatalogus/">Stelselcatalogus</a>. </p><ul><li>Digilevering distributes up-to-date and accurate key register data to key register clients in the shape of event messages, for instance relocation of a company, the birth of a person, or a change in somebody’s income. Each receiving organization is responsible for determining which data are relevant.</li><li>Digimelding; The information stored in key registers has to be up-to-date and reliable. One of the tools used to guarantee the quality of the key registers is Digimelding (‘Diginotification’), which enables users to ‘report back’. All users of the base registers have a legal duty to report any data that they know could be wrong. Reporting back contributes to efficient operations management within the government, improves the level of service, and increases the opportunities to fight fraud.</li><li>Digikoppeling consists of standards for interfaces and containing agreements for the exchange of messages between authorities. One Digikoppeling implementation in an IT-environment enables you to exchange messages with all authorities, and to join nearly all eOverheidbouwsstenen (e-Government Building Blocks), for instance the key registers. Governmental as well as private organisations that perform a public task can use Digikoppeling.</li><li>Stelselcatalogus; The System Catalogue makes visible which data the base registers system contains, what they mean, and how they are interconnected. The System Catalogue is targeted to inform policy makers and legislation lawyers. The source code for Stelselcatalogus can be found as an open source software in Github through the OSSG (OpenSourceSoftwareGegevenscatalogus).</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Standard Business Reporting </p><p>Standard Business Reporting (SBR) provides governments and businesses with an unequivocal, cost-effective, secure and adaptable method for the exchange of business information between organisations in a reporting chain. With Standard Business Reporting (SBR), the Dutch Government and the businesses in the Netherlands have come to an agreement regarding the way accountability information is being reported. This leads to an undisputed set of financial information.</p><p>SBR is already operational. The following organisations accept or require SBR: Tax and Customs Administration (e.g. Value Added Tax, Corporation Tax Return), Chamber of Commerce (annual reports), Central Statistical Office (production and investment statistics), and banks (annual credit reports). In 2018, a total of 42.8 million SBR messages were exchanged. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>DigiD</p><p>The eID approach is an enterprise in which public and private authentication solutions coexist. The public solution for citizens (DigiD) is reserved for G2C authentications. The policy aims at strengthening DigiD in two ways: on the one hand by introducing new certificates on ID cards and drivers licences to have a higher level of trust (high); on the other hand, by accepting under strict conditions a private authentication solution in order to promote resilience. </p><p>DigiD enables individuals to identify themselves for digital services. DigiD offers security: you know who you are dealing with. Using DigiD, the Citizen Service Number (BSN) of the person logging in is disclosed. This makes it possible to check the information already on file for that individual and offer personalized services. At this moment, logging in involves a user name and password, and in some cases a text message for extra verification. In July 2017 the <a href="https://www.digid.nl/over-digid/app/">DigiD App</a> was launched. </p><p>DigiD is available at three levels: </p><ul><li>basic (user name and password: DigiD)  </li><li>middle (DigiD + sms-authentication or using the <a href="https://www.digid.nl/over-digid/app/">DigiD app</a>), which both represent a stork QAA level 2, and </li><li>substantial (the DigiD app upgraded with an ID verification), stork QAA level 3.</li></ul><p>Although not mandatory by law yet, DigiD has become the main authentication system for citizens. There was a total of 13.8 million active accounts in 2018. In 2018, the platform was connected to 945 web-services provided by 647 public institutions. In 2018, more than 307 million DigiD authentications were made. </p><p class="subtitle">DigiD Mandate</p><p>'DigiD Authorise' enables users of a digital service to authorise someone to act on their behalf. This can come in handy if the user is not adept at using computers or digital services or wants to defer to someone who is more knowledgeable in the subject matter. A user who utilizes ‘DigiD authorise’ does not need to divulge their own DigiD to the person they authorise, and only gives the authorisation for one specific service. In 2018, there were more than 2.1 million active authorisations used.  </p><p class="subtitle">Administrative facility BSN</p><p>The administrative facility citizen service number (<em>Beheervoorziening burgerservicenummer</em>, BV BSN) is in charge of generating, issuing, managing, and consulting the citizen service number (BSN).

The Dutch government uses the data recorded in the BRP. Amongst other things, these are: name, date and place of birth, address, and familial relations. Other organizations also use the BRP data, for instance pension funds and research institutions. The Municipal personal records register (GBA) and the register non-residents (RNI) together constitute the personal records base register (BRP). Responsible ministry: Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. </li><li><a href="https://www.nldigitalgovernment.nl/dossiers/key-registers-and-system-standards/">Trade Register</a> (<a href="https://www.nldigitalgovernment.nl/dossiers/key-registers-and-system-standards/">HR</a>) contains all businesses and legal entities. All other economic actors are also listed in this register. This guarantees legal security when doing business. All government bodies will be required to make use of this register. For instance, a municipality will have to consult the Trade Register when searching for a company’s details. Responsible ministry: Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy.</li><li>Base register for Addresses and Buildings (<a href="http://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/stelselinformatiepunt/stelsel-van-basisregistraties/basisregistraties-adressen-en-gebouwen">BAG</a>) contains municipal basic data of all addresses and buildings inside the municipality. The data is collected in a National Facility (Landelijke Voorziening, BAG LV). The Dutch land registration organisation Kadaster manages the BAG LV, and provides data to public offices, institutions, companies, and private citizens. Responsible ministry: Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. </li><li>Base registers Topography (<a href="https://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/planning/releasekalender-digitale-overheid/voorziening/basisregistratie-topografie-brt/">BRT</a>), The BRT is a unique source of information for all mid- and small-scale topographic maps (scale of 1:10.000 or smaller scale maps) with which government authorities can easily exchange geographic information. It is kept by the Land Registry. Responsible ministry: Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. </li><li>Base register large scale topography (<a href="http://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/stelselinformatiepunt/stelsel-van-basisregistraties/basisregistratie-grootschalige-topografie">BGT</a>) a digital map of the Netherlands, which records buildings, roads, waterways, land, and railway lines in a uniform way. The map is accurate up to 20 centimeters and contains many details, just as you would see in reality. In short, it documents the spatial organization of our physical surroundings: trees, roads, buildings. Responsible ministry: Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. </li><li>Base register Cadastral Records (<a href="https://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/planning/releasekalender-digitale-overheid/voorziening/basisregistratie-kadaster-brk/">BRK</a>) consists of the cadastral registration and the cadastral map (Kadastrale Kaart). Cadastral data is used by many clients as the foundation for their own work processes. In that sense, the Kadaster has been a base register for a long time. The Kadaster’s products remain available through MijnKadaster and the other channels. Direct links to other key registers will enable incorporation of the data of other registers into the cadastral register and products. Responsible ministry: Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. </li><li>Base register Vehicle records (<a href="http://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/stelselinformatiepunt/stelsel-van-basisregistraties/basisregistratie-voertuigen">BRV</a>) lists data of vehicles, vehicle registration documents, and persons to whom the vehicle registration document was assigned. The Netherlands Vehicle Authority (RDW, Dienst Wegverkeer) provides information from the register to authorities, citizens, and businesses. Responsible Ministry: Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management</li><li>Base register Income (<a href="http://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/stelselinformatiepunt/stelsel-van-basisregistraties/basisregistratie-inkomen">BRI</a>) contains the total income or taxable annual income of everybody who files an income tax return. Government organisations use the BRI to determine supplements, subsidies, or benefits. The income registered in the BRI is called the registered income. You can view your registered income (of the previous year) on MijnOverheid (MyGovernment). Responsible ministry: Ministry of Finance.</li><li>Base register Property Valuation (<a href="http://www.digitaleoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/stelselinformatiepunt/stelsel-van-basisregistraties/basisregistratie-waarde-onroerende-zaken">WOZ</a>) consists of several data, needed to relate this value both to an immovable property and to a stakeholder. These are: “Established value” (WOZ value), a BAG-listed address, and a link to cadastral parcels and/or addresses, and to BAG dwellings, stations, berths, and/or objects. Responsible ministry: Ministry of Finance.</li><li><a href="https://www.basisregistratieondergrond.nl/">Base register subsoil (BRO) </a>contains all public data on the Dutch subsoil. The BRO Act, which came into effect on 1 January 2018, requires that source data owners provide and use soil and underground data in a digital form. The requirements will be expanded step by step in the next 4 years. The data in this key register have been validated and are of importance for activities like fresh water procurement, underground transport, and mineral mining, but also for activities on the surface, like energy transition, housing construction, and infrastructural projects.
