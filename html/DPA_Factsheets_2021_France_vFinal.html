The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-206.png" alt="35-206.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for France in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-211.jpeg" alt="35-211.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>France’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 3 (Transparency) and 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) for which the scores of 3 and 2 respectively show a medium to upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the internal visibility and provision of external interfaces for European public services (Principle 3 – Recommendation 5) and the accessibility of public services to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) could be improved in order to reach the maximum score of 4 in corresponding principles.</p><p><img src="img/35-219.jpeg" alt="35-219.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>In spite of the lack of data for the interoperability layer related to the integration of public service governance, the French results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall good performance with scores of 3 and 4. Potential areas of improvement to foster the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of legal and governance interoperability. More specifically, the score of 1 for France in Recommendation 23, stating that relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level should be consulted when procuring and developing ICT solutions, lowers the overall interoperability governance result for France.</p><p><img src="img/35-226.jpeg" alt="35-226.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>France’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a very good performance with a maximum score of 4 in the implementation of recommendations associated with internal and external information sources and services, base registries, catalogues, security and privacy, internal information sources and services, and open data. Although aligned with the EU average, there is still area for improvement regarding the implementation of the recommendations related to external information sources and services. More precisely, the use of external information sources when developing public services (External information sources and services - Recommendation 45) could be developed further, which would consequently improve the overall French score in Scoreboard 3.</p><p>Additional information on France’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

This agile and collaborative programme aims to help the State seize the opportunities offered by digital technologies to improve public services and bring the administration closer to citizens, businesses and civil servants. Tech.gouv addresses six priority issues: simplification, inclusion, attractiveness, command, economies and alliances. The strategy is structured around eight missions: </p><ul><li>Four missions related to digital products and services to develop new uses (labelling, digital identity, data and infrastructure); </li><li>Four missions related to the promotion of digital expertise to accelerate public service transformation (pilot, talents, factory and transformation).</li></ul><p>Tech.gouv is accompanied by a three-year action plan centred on 35 priority projects and actions.</p><p class="subtitle">National Strategy for an Inclusive Digital Society</p><p>In September 2018, the <a href="https://societenumerique.gouv.fr/plannational/">National Strategy for an Inclusive Digital Society and the initiative Digital in Common(s)</a> were launched on the occasion of the first event bringing together all actors of digital mediation. The objective is to train 1.5 million people in digital literacy to reduce inequalities and provide equal opportunities for all throughout the country. With 13 million French people who still do not use the internet, or only to a limited extent, including 6.7 million who never connect to the internet, the government faces a real challenge to carry out the digital transformation of the State. The National Strategy is based on four main approaches:</p><ul><li>Detecting audiences struggling with digital technology;</li><li>Offering human support in the process;</li><li>Training those who wish to do so thanks to the Digital Pass; </li><li>Strengthening the players in digital mediation.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Public Action 2022 </p><p>The <a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/action-publique-2022-pour-une-transformation-du-service-public">Public Action 2022</a> programme was launched in September 2017 by the French Prime Minister, Édouard Philippe, aiming to modernise the State. The programme has three objectives: improving the quality of public service provided to the user; improving the working conditions of staff; and helping to control the budget path. To achieve these objectives, the government developed a National Strategy for the Transformation of Public Action, published at the <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/action-publique-2022/actualites/un-2eme-comite-interministeriel-de-la-transformation-publique-ce-quil-faut-retenir">second Inter-ministerial Committee for Public Transformation</a> in October 2018. The Strategy includes precise and quantifiable indicators to measure and report on the success of the programme. French citizens will thus be able to monitor the progress of the reforms. The ambition is to have a closer, simpler and more efficient State to better meet citizens' expectations, with transparency in monitoring being a guarantee of the success of reforms.</p><p>The National Strategy is based on four streams guiding the government's action: </p><ul><li>Public services closer to users;</li><li>Simpler and more accessible approaches;</li><li>Clearer and more effective public intervention; </li><li>A State that transforms itself.</li></ul><p>A considerable part of the action in the field involves digital solutions, thus contributing to the promotion and development of digital government. </p><p>In June 2019, the Prime Minister launched the second part of the initiatives aiming at public transformation, inspired by citizens’ contributions to the <em>Grand débat national, </em>a public consultation conducted earlier in the year. This second part is centred on three priority commitments: a simpler and more responsive administrative organisation; closer and more accessible administrations; and a more efficient administration, able to leverage digital tools for the benefit of end-users, public servants and public policies.</p><p>This over-arching strategy has been implemented by each Ministry through Ministerial Transformation Plans that define the modalities for implementing major government reforms (milestones, achievements and impact indicators). The monitoring of the implementation of these reforms is carried out by the Inter-ministerial Directorate for Public Transformation with the Offices of the Prime Minister and the President of the Republic and takes the form of high-level follow-up meetings scheduled at regular intervals. Since the programme’s launch, five Inter-ministerial Committees for Public Transformation have been organised, the latest one having taken place in February 2021, with <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/transformation-publique/comites-interministeriels-de-la-transformation-publique/article-citp">renewed commitments for the State’s digital transformation</a>. </p><p class="subtitle">Ministerial Transformation Plans</p><p>Following the roadmap that the Prime Minister sent to each member of the government at the beginning of his term of office, each Minister has now drawn up a <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/action-publique-2022/plans-de-transformation/les-plans-de-transformation-ministeriels">Ministerial Transformation Plan</a>, for which he/she is responsible, to ensure the implementation of the main reforms. After the design and trade-off phase, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Inter-Ministerial Committee for the Transformation of Public Action (CITP) was introduced to accelerate the implementation of the Ministries' roadmaps and their Transformation Plans. These Plans are monitored at the highest level to ensure that the reforms undertaken are translated into concrete results. The ambition is to have a closer, simpler and more efficient State to better meet citizens' expectations.</p><p class="subtitle">Ministerial Digital Transformation Plans </p><p>As part of the <a href="https://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/laction-publique-se-transforme/avec-les-administrations-et-les-operateurs-publics/action-publique-2022">Public Action 2022</a> initiative launched by the Prime Minister in October 2017, at the end of the same year the Minister for the Armed Forces defined a roadmap setting three objectives for the <a href="http://www.defense.gouv.fr/actualites/articles/le-ministere-des-armees-presente-son-plan-transformation-numerique">digital transformation</a> of the Ministry:</p><ul><li>Ensure operational superiority and information literacy in theatres of operations;</li><li>Strengthen the efficiency of support and facilitate the daily lives of staff; </li><li>Improve the relationship with citizens and the attractiveness of the Ministry.</li></ul><p>This Ministerial Digital Transformation Plan was the first to be presented and sets out actions in a concrete way, as the Minister for the Armed Forces reminded: “After four months of work, we are now entering the action phase. This Plan offers concrete measures to fully achieve our objectives and address the digital transformation”.</p><p>At the same time, the education system is engaged in profound <a href="https://www.education.gouv.fr/cid133192/le-numerique-service-ecole-confiance.html">pedagogical and organisational transformations</a>, from nursery schools to post-baccalaureate, requiring to thoroughly mobilise the potential of digital technology. Digital technology represents a powerful lever for transformation to support ministerial policy in all its dimensions: pedagogical transformation, with digital technology at the service of learning and evaluation; training in the challenges and professions of tomorrow; simplification of relations with users; and modernisation of the functioning of the State with redesigned information systems. In addition, today the Ministry of National Education produces a very large amount of data related to school life, student assessments and results, and work and homework performed by students. A wide variety of personal digital data is collected, stored and processed by a multitude of actors (schools and educational institutions, academic services, local authorities, and private partners providing educational resources and digital services). In this context, the Ministry must ensure that the flow, processing and storage of school data strictly respects the privacy of students and their families, teachers and administrative staff. </p><p class="subtitle">Digital Local Administration Joint Development Programme </p><p>The State Secretary for Digital Affairs launched the <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/programme-dcant/">Digital Local Administration Joint Development Programme (DCANT)</a> in 2018. The programme was co-created by associations of elected representatives and representatives of governmental services. It aimed at promoting the roadmap for regional digital transformation, as well as building complementary and efficient digital public services. The programme had four priorities:</p><ul><li>Building a common foundation for applications, digital blocks, and shared frameworks to accelerate digital transformation;</li><li>Guaranteeing shared governance of the digital transformation between the State and local authorities;</li><li>Contributing to a global approach to data to the benefit of public policies;</li><li>Facilitating the scaling up of digital administration.</li></ul><p>Since the adoption of the programme, the actions linked to these priorities have been updated/enriched every six months and reviewed by a steering committee. A <a href="https://www.lagazettedescommunes.com/telechargements/2021/02/bilan-dcant-20182020-final.pdf">report</a> on the final results of the DCANT Program was published in January 2021.</p><p>The programme’s objectives have mainly been reached and, to build on the several successes of the last two programme editions (2015-2017 and 2018-2020), a new programme will be launched in May 2021 and should pursue 3 main goals: </p><ul><li>Building strong political steering and involvement on the program’s topics;</li><li>Making the stakeholders invest time and resources to create value through the implementation of concrete digital solutions impacting positively French citizens’ life and/or public servants’ work for local authorities;</li><li>Reinforcing the elements of the French Recovery plan dedicated to the digital transformation of local authorities with complementary actions to reach the digital transformation sought by the French government. This program will last 2 years (instead of 3) to match the duration of the <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/france-relance">France Relance</a> economic recovery plan that was launched by the Prime Minister on 3 September 2020 following the COVID economic crisis.</li></ul><p>These objectives of the upcoming plan are set to increase the digital transformation of the State by building, together with citizens, private partners, public servants, and State and elected representatives, a collaborative digital administration that should be:</p><ul><li>Inclusive and efficient;</li><li>Open and transparent; </li><li>Secured and promoting French and European sovereignties. </li></ul><p>The results of the programme’s initiative will be followed by a coordination review steering committee. They will then be challenged and validated by the Ministry of Transformation and Public Service, the Minister of Territorial Cohesion and Relations with Local Bodies, and the State Secretary for Digital Affairs, every 6 months.</p><p class="subtitle">Government Roadmap for the Digital Economy</p><p>Following a workshop on the digital economy organised on 28 February 2013, the government presented the <a href="https://www.economie.gouv.fr/feuille-de-route-pour-le-numerique">Government Roadmap for the Digital Economy</a>.

The Strategy will be financed by the State to the tune of EUR 665 million by 2022. The Strategy is largely based on research, that is the foundation of AI development. In this field, France already holds a recognised place thanks to its excellent mathematics and computer science schools. In this context, the objective of the Strategy is twofold:</p><ul><li>Making France one of the top five AI expert countries in the world on a sustainable basis;</li><li>Making France the European leader in AI research.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Selection of AI Projects for the AI Lab</p><p>Since the announcement of the National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, the Inter-ministerial Directorate for Digital Affairs (DINUM) and the Inter-ministerial Directorate for Public Transformation (DITP) have organised two calls for expression of interest to identify public sector AI projects:</p><ul><li>One in 2018, with <a href="https://numerique.gouv.fr/actualites/intelligence-artificielle-6-projets-selectionnes-pour-etre-experimentes-dans-les-services-publics/">6 projects</a> selected;</li><li>One in 2019, with <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/actualites/intelligence-artificielle-15-nouveaux-projets-vont-etre-experimentes-dans-les-administrations/">15 projects</a> selected.</li></ul><p>Proposals were submitted by various administrations (central and decentralised bodies, operators, public institutions, rectors, universities, courts of laws, hospitals, etc.) and selected by a jury of experts.

It encourages the use of Cloud Computing based on an offer split into 2 parts:</p><ul><li>Internal cloud, which corresponds to infrastructure fully controlled by the French central administration, including hosting, engineering, operations, monitoring. This internal cloud is reserved for the most sensitive data and applications and for the exclusive use of the central administration. Local administrations and public companies cannot therefore access such resources. Two platforms are in production, each supported by a ministry and all on Openstack technologies. They both offer a high level of resilience with two regions and multiple availability zones;</li><li>External cloud, which gathers all resources that can be found on the internet. It can be mobilised whenever permitted by the context, mixing different levels of sensitivity and application criticality regarding service continuity considerations. The use of the external cloud is allowed to central administrations under the strict condition: sensitive data has to be hosted by cloud providers with SecNumCloud qualification (delivered by ANSSI - the French National Cybersecurity Agency of France) and out of the reach of extra-EU regulations. Such condition is without prejudice to other rules application (GDPR or health-related information). The external cloud is the subject of a public contract open to the whole French public administrations (or sector) giving access to the main public Cloud offers (IaaS and PaaS). ANSSI works in close cooperation with ENISA in the trust label convergence process, therefore the European standard has replaced the SecNumCloud requirement for the French Administration.</li></ul><p><a id="_Toc8716918"></a>On 17 May 2021, the French government presented an updated version of its <a href="https://www.economie.gouv.fr/cloud-souverain-17-mai">Cloud Strategy</a>. Cloud computing is one of the priority projects for the digital transformation of the French State. The French State Cloud strategy aims at encouraging public actors to seize the opportunities attached to the Cloud with the ultimate objective to provide a better public service to citizens, while at the same time keeping strict control over sensitive data.</p><p>The challenges are therefore at several levels:</p><ul><li><strong>A transformation</strong> challenge: cloud computing is an enabler of a wider transformation, involving agility with business stakeholders, technical leadership and IT delivery transformation towards DevOps;</li><li><strong>A sovereignty</strong> challenge: the adoption of the cloud should not hinder France’s autonomy in terms of decision-making or action, even though the leadership on the cloud computing playground currently seems beyond the reach of European players;</li><li><strong>An industrial</strong> challenge: the adoption of Cloud Computing by the French administrations is a win-win opportunity for key European IT-players.

Consumers can thus assess the degree of credibility of the reviews available online; </li><li><strong>Openness of public data: </strong>public bodies such as social landlords must publish their databases online. In addition, public authorities are required to guarantee the quality and updating of ‘reference data’ such as the national address database, thereby facilitating the work of local public services such as fire brigades and emergency services; </li><li><strong>Improved accessibility: </strong>all public administration websites have to specify their level of compliance with accessibility regulations, failing which financial penalties will be applied.

This Law complements the regulatory and non-regulatory measures as well as tax measures that are incorporated into the 2019 Budget Law. All these measures make up the <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/action/pacte-le-plan-d-action-pour-la-croissance-et-la-transformation-des-entreprises">Action Plan for the Growth and Transformation of Enterprises (PACTE)</a>. The PACTE has two objectives: making companies grow so that they create more jobs and redefining the place of companies in society to better involve employees. From creation to transfer, the PACTE removes obstacles, simplifying business creation and easing workforce thresholds. In particular, entrepreneurs’ lives will be simplified thanks to the creation of a single online platform for business formalities. The PACTE is a new step in the country's economic transformation and the fourth phase of the economic reforms initiated by the government more than two years ago. The Action Plan is in line with ordinances for strengthening social dialogue and the tax reform initiated by the <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000036339197&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id">2018 Budget</a> Law. Moreover, the PACTE acts in parallel with the Law on the Freedom to Choose One's Professional Future to give small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the means to create jobs. The PACTE is the result of a co-construction process initiated with companies, parliamentarians, and local authorities in October 2017. Following this first phase of consultation, companies, individuals, and professional federations were able to express their views in early 2018, during an online public consultation that gathered several thousand contributions and counted 65,000 votes.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474971"></a><a id="_Toc8716928"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p>No pieces of legislations in this field have been reported to date. </p><p><img src="img/35-462.jpeg" alt="35-462.jpeg" /></p><p> </p><p>	 Digital Public Administration Governance </p><p>5</p><h1><a id="_Toc8716929"></a><a id="_Toc44061151"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474973"></a><a id="_Toc8716930"></a>National </h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474974"></a><a id="_Toc8716931"></a>Policy</h3><p class="subtitle">Ministry for Public Transformation and Civil Service</p><p>In France, the eGovernment strategy is under responsibility of the Prime Minister, Mr Castex and the Minister for Public Transformation and Civil Service, who is in charge of the coordination of all work on the modernisation and simplification of the State.</p><table><tr><td><p><img src="img/35-507.jpeg" alt="35-507.jpeg" /></p></td><td><p><strong>Jean Castex</strong></p><p><strong>Prime Minister </strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Contact details:</strong></p><p>Hôtel Matignon</p><p>57, rue de Varenne</p><p>75700 Paris SP 07 </p><p><strong>Tel.</strong>: (+33) 1 42 75 80 00</p><p><strong>E-mail</strong>: N/A</p><p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr">http://www.gouvernement.fr</a></p></td></tr></table><table><tr><td><p><img src="img/35-512.jpeg" alt="Amélie de Montchalin (@AdeMontchalin) | Twitter" /></p></td><td><p><strong>Amélie de Montchalin</strong></p><p>Minister for Public Transformation and Civil Service </p><p><strong>Contact details:</strong></p><p>Hôtel de Rothelin-Charolais,</p><p>101 rue de Grenelle,</p><p>75007 Paris<s> </s><strong>Tel.</strong>: 01 40 04 04 04</p><p>E-mail: N/A</p><p><strong>Source</strong>:<em> </em><a href="http://www.gouvernement.fr/ministre/christophe-sirugue">http://www.gouvernement.fr</a></p></td></tr></table><p class="subtitle">Inter-ministerial Directorate for Public Transformation (DITP) </p><p>The General Secretary for the Modernisation of Public Administration (SGMAP), operating from 2012 to 2017, was transformed into two new Inter-ministerial Directorates by <a href="http://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/fichiers-attaches/jo_decret_2017-1584_0.pdf">Decree No. 2017-1584</a> of 20 November 2017:</p><ul><li>the <a href="http://www.modernisation.gouv.fr/node/194876">Inter-Ministerial Directorate for Public Transformation (DITP)</a>, under the authority of the Minister of State Reform and led by the Inter-ministerial Delegate for Public Transformation; </li><li>the <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/dinum/">Inter-Ministerial Directorate for Digital Affairs and State Information and Communication System (DINUM, formerly known as DINSIC)</a>, placed, by the delegation of the Prime Minister, under the authority of the Secretary of State for the Digital Sector.</li></ul><p>The DITP supports Ministries and administrations in the public transformation of the State.

This <a href="https://api.gouv.fr">catalogue of APIs</a> is primarily intended for service creators and API consumers and aims to facilitate the discovery and understanding of APIs, and the access to APIs and their producers. At the same time, the catalogue enables suppliers to easily publicise their APIs. </p><p>Administrations often consume several APIs (from different producers) to implement a teleservice or a new approach. The use of an interdepartmental tool allows them to ensure consistency in the authorisation procedure and centralise their requests.</p><p>To facilitate the lives of data providers, DINUM developed a specific tool to manage the authorisation phase, called ‘DataPass’. Furthermore, DINUM created two API hubs, namely <a href="https://entreprise.api.gouv.fr/">API Enterprise</a> and <a href="https://api.gouv.fr/les-api/api-particulier">API Particulier</a>.</p><p><strong>DataPass</strong></p><p>The DINUM worked on setting up a common legal framework to harmonise and streamline relations between data providers and service providers through the construction of DataPass, a tool facilitating the connection between suppliers and consumers. This tool is intended for stakeholders (e.g. public administrations) who wish to use personal data. DataPass delivers authorisations through a simple, standardised and compliant process, to access all protected data produced by the State.</p><p>For the stakeholders requesting access to data, DataPass contains the following features: </p><ul><li>APIs centralising authorisations stemming from public administrations (available as well for any other type of organisations, both public and private);</li><li>Single account to access API managers and request access to the DataPass tool (SSO);</li><li>Management of authorisations to access API; </li><li>Email notification from the Data Protection Officer and the data controller of the users’ organisation when a request has been validated.</li></ul><p>For the data controller:</p><ul><li>Email notification for each new access request;</li><li>Automation of the creation of API manager access accounts;</li><li>Automation of token creation through interaction with the API manager;</li><li>Publication of validated authorisations on <a href="https://datapass.api.gouv.fr/public">DataPass</a> in accordance with the GDPR;</li><li>Activity management / <a href="https://datapass.api.gouv.fr/stats">statistical dashboard</a>. </li></ul><p><strong>API Entreprise</strong></p><p>Digital technology enables the pre-filling and digitisation of administrative forms that businesses are required to complete, in particular to enable the exchange of information between the different departments and agencies. Since 2014 two projects have been running in the framework of the inter-ministerial programme.</p><p>Public administrations can access this information through APIs (<a href="https://api.apientreprise.fr/documentation">API Entreprise</a>) that provide information from different base registries. The base registries that are made available through the APIs are:</p><ul><li>INSEE (administrative information / contact details and identity);</li><li>Info-Greffe (legal information / legal status);</li><li>INPI (legal acts / business acts);</li><li>Ministry of Social Affairs (collective agreements);</li><li><em>Chambre des métiers et de l’Artisanat</em> (CMA) France (handicraft enterprise information);</li><li>ADEME (energy certificates);</li><li>DGFiP (fiscal information / taxation / turnover);</li><li>ACOSS &amp; MSA (social situation / social security contributions);</li><li>Customs (economic operator registration and identification);</li><li><em>Caisses retraites</em> (pension funds).</li></ul><p>The API Enterprise hub aims to centralise company information owned by French administrations (General Directorate of Public Finance, Companies Register, Associations Register, etc.) to help administrative service providers to develop simplified online procedures, e.g. public procurement applications or requests for public subsidies. DINUM performs the technical interfacing with the different APIs within standards that are up-to-date with industrial constraints. Public service providers just have to deal with a single account and a single contact to access multiple data to develop online public services.</p><p><strong>API Particulier</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://api.gouv.fr/les-api/api-particulier#exemples-dâapplication">API Particulier</a> hub aims to centralise personal data owned by French administrations (National Family Allowance Fund, General Directorate of Public Finance, etc.) to help administrative service providers (administrations, cities, departments, etc.) to develop simplified and improved online procedures. DINUM performs the technical interfacing with the different APIs within standards that are up-to-date with industrial constraints. Public service providers just have to deal with a single account and a single contact to access multiple data to develop online public services.</p><p>For instance, the API hub helps administrations to simplify and improve administrative online processes such as scholarship applications. In this case, families’ incomes were directly retrieved from tax centres. In September 2018, the French administration received 650,000 successful calls, corresponding to as many supporting documents that did not need to be produced. This saves time for families: in the past, some parents had to take half a day off work to submit their applications, others to ask their children to queue during recess.<strong> </strong>Today, to replace a supporting document with a call to API Particulier users must still enter specific information to the administration, such as tax number or beneficiary number. The French administration would like users to be able to identify themselves more easily through <a href="https://franceconnect.gouv.fr/">FranceConnect</a>.<strong> </strong>Thus, with a single login and password, the API hub would allow everyone to simplify their procedures. </p><p class="subtitle">State as a Platform</p><p>The Inter-ministerial Directorate for Information Systems built the foundations of the <a href="http://etatplateforme.modernisation.gouv.fr/"><em>Etat plateforme</em></a> (State as a Platform), i.e. an architecture supporting the creation of a new kind of digital public services.
