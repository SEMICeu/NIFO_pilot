The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation.

Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 3 (Transparency), 4 (Reusability), 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility), 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Particularly, the degree of internal visibility and provision of external interfaces for European public services (Principle 3 – Recommendation 5) and the reuse and sharing of information and data when implementing European public services except when privacy and confidentiality restrictions apply (Principle 4 – Recommendation 7) are partial and could be bettered to reach the European average of 4. </p><p><img src="img/35-380.jpeg" alt="35-380.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Portuguese results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall average performance with scores of 2, 3 and 4. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance, integrated public service governance, organisational interoperability and semantic interoperability. More specifically, the scores of 2 for Portugal in Recommendation 28, stating that business processes should be documented using commonly accepted modelling techniques to ensure their alignment, and in Recommendation 30, declaring that data and information should be perceived as a public asset that should be appropriately generated, collected, managed, shared, protected and preserved lower the overall implementation of semantic and organisational interoperability in Portugal.</p><p><img src="img/35-383.jpeg" alt="35-383.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Portugal’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model itself, internal information sources and services, base registries and security and privacy.

Precisely, establishing procedures and processes to integrate the opening of data in the country’s common business processes, working routines, and in the development of new information systems (Open Data – Recommendation 41), putting in place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions (Catalogues - Recommendation 44) and using of external information sources and services while developing European public services (External information and services – Recommendation 45) could be further improved to better the overall Portuguese score on Scoreboard 3.</p><p>Additional information on Portugal’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p> </p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p> </p><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

It follows a citizen-driven approach and has a strong focus on co-creation, with the ultimate goal of simplifying as much as possible citizens and businesses’ everyday life as well as their interaction with the public administration. SIMPLEX pursues in one single governmental programme the objectives of better regulation, administrative burden reduction, service interoperability, digitisation, red tape cutting and digital government promotion.</p><p>The responsibility for the programme lies with the Minister for State Modernisation and Public Administration, directly supported by the Prime Minister. The Secretary of State for Innovation and Administrative Modernisation is in charge of coordinating and monitoring the programme, with the technical support of the Administrative Modernisation Agency. Furthermore, SIMPLEX includes a Focal Point Network, consisting of representatives of the various Ministries.</p><p>The programme is highly inclusive and innovative, involving citizens, entrepreneurs and public servants in determining and designing the initiatives to be implemented by the public administration. Participants are offered channels for their involvement through the organisation of nationwide meetings and design brainstorming sessions, ‘Start-up SIMPLEX’ competitions and the SIMPLEX website.</p><p>Overall, SIMPLEX has already launched over 1 600 simplification measures. </p><p>SIMPLEX has proven to be a successful and replicable model, with an average annual execution rate exceeding 88.59% (2016-2019) and a very positive feedback from the programme’s stakeholders. In 2019, an Ernst &amp; Young evaluation, commissioned by the European Commission in coordination with the Portuguese government, analysed the impact of 40 measures of SIMPLEX 2016 and 2017, concluding that they represented a yearly net saving of EUR 170.1 million and 15 million working hours, plus a potential additional benefit for the economy corresponding to EUR 89 million. The effectiveness of the SIMPLEX methodology has been further recognised by the European Institute of Public Administration, which awarded SIMPLEX the <a href="https://epsa2019.eu/en/news/show/&amp;tid=182">European Public Service Award 2019</a> in the European and national category.</p><p>Simplex 2020/2021 – Part of our lives</p><p>The <a href="https://www.simplex.gov.pt/">2020/2021</a> edition is organized around two main blocks, ‘Better Public Service’ and ‘Modern and Innovative Public Administration’, including a total of 158 measures.</p><p>A standout measure of this edition is ‘My Data’, which will allow citizens to know when and why the public sector interchanges personal information relating to them.

It provides both informational and transactional services, in line with the citizen-driven approach that the Portuguese government has been implementing for the last years. A wide range of transactional services can be performed directly on the ePortugal Portal, including changing the address on the Citizen Card and requesting a variety of certificates. Additionally, the portal integrates the <a href="https://eportugal.gov.pt/inicio/espaco-empresa/balcao-do-empreendedor">Entrepreneur’s Desk</a>, which is the point of single contact for digital services related to the exercise of economic activity. </p><p>The ePortugal Portal is dynamic and adaptable to individual users, offering several customisation options and a Reserved Area that allows them to access different information regarding their relationship with the public administration (e.g. check when the user’s data was requested for authentication on other portals, using the electronic identification means provided by <a href="https://www.autenticacao.gov.pt/">Autenticacao.gov</a>; check the status of user’s requests; and view a list of the user’s electronic medical prescriptions). Registered users also have access to a documents folder where they can save documents and share them with other registered users or with the public entities that have subscribed to this service. </p><p>Likewise, ePortugal intends to facilitate the interaction between citizens/companies and the State by providing innovative support instruments such as the above-mentioned <a href="https://digiplace.sharepoint.com/sites/WE-EUROPEANCOMMISSION-ABCIVSC263NIFO/Shared Documents/D04.01 Digital Government factsheets and infographics/Country factsheets 2020/Portugal/mapa.eportugal.gov.pt">Citizen Map</a> (available as an app, for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pt.ama.mapadocidadao&amp;hl=pt_PT">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/pt/app/mapa-de-cidadÃ£o/id966526205">iOS</a>), which provides georeferenced information for all public services and also allows the user to get digital queue tickets for onsite public services. In addition, it includes the chatbot SIGMA, a digital assistant based on AI that helps users to find and use the available services, and allows to request a contact with one of the available helplines to citizens and entrepreneurs.</p><p>During 2020, ePortugal continued to evolve and integrate new areas related to services and information provided. Several pages targeted at European citizens were created with information about living and doing business in Portugal, in line with the Single Digital Gateway Regulation. The portal’s Reserved Area was also significantly upgraded, offering more services and options to follow up on service requests and economic activities. Another significant addition is the new platform for receiving official government notifications – Electronic Notifications – that is now available on ePortugal and via a dedicated app. </p><p>Following the 2020 COVID-19 outburst, ePortugal has had an increased relevance as a privileged vehicle to prevent social contact and thus strengthen the fight against the virus. </p><p class="subtitle">COVID-19 Public Information: EstamosOn</p><p>On 18 March 2020, the central administration launched <a href="http://www.covid19estamoson.gov.pt">EstamosOn</a> as the single point of contact for all relevant information on the COVID-19 prevention and containment measures. This national platform, directed to citizens, families and companies, offers:</p><ul><li>Communication campaigns to encourage the use of digital public services, promoting the ePortugal Portal as a way to minimize social contact;</li><li>Technological tools (and respective tutorials) to operationalise the telework regime and facilitate the pursuit of day-to-day activities;</li><li>A list of the exceptional measures adopted by each governance area, political communications and relevant legislation, accompanied by FAQs;</li><li>A dashboard with the epidemiological evolution in Portugal;</li><li>A section with questions collected from social networks and answered by the competent health authorities; and</li><li>A complete, consolidated and reliable list of emergency and support contacts created by the various public services.</li></ul><p>All contents are also available through a mobile application (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vost.covid19mobile">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/estamos-on-covid19/id1502916368">iOS</a>) to ensure their dissemination to different end-users.</p><p class="subtitle">Open Data (Dados.gov+)</p><p>Following international practices in the area (e.g. the US or the UK Data.Gov projects), AMA has committed to the development of a wide and open platform containing all kinds of data from public bodies. The objective of this policy - keeping in mind the right of any citizen to consult public administration information - is to democratise citizens’ access by operating on the means to obtain it. As a result, the <a href="https://dados.gov.pt/en/">Open Data Portal</a> makes available to citizens an extensive range of information from very diverse areas.</p><p>The Dados.gov web-portal was relaunched in May 2018 as Dados.gov+, replacing its previous 2012 version. Developed under the SIMPLEX+ Programme, this new version was designed to conform to the best international practices in the field, and incorporate innovative solutions in terms of user experience, content structure, data integration and user licenses. </p><p>Managed by AMA and available in open source, Dados.gov is based on the French UDATA platform, which was developed by ETALAB, and already has more than 2 030 datasets. It is free and open to all users that want to access data, but also to citizens and organisations that wish to make data of public interest available. All they need to do is to register, receive their application programming interface (API) key and characterise the dataset they wish to upload. Each dataset can have more than one associated resource and can be published in different and multiple formats, which is one of the features enabling data reuse. It is also possible to index datasets by introducing an URL referring to the origin of the data, which is ideal for entities that already have the information available in their own platforms, like the partilha.justiça.gov.pt from the Ministry of Justice or the <em>Lisboa Aberta</em> portal from the Lisbon City Hall. In case the supplying entity already possesses its own data portal, the publishing process can also be made through data harvest, thus collecting the data in a regular and automated way.</p><p class="subtitle">Web Accessibility and Usability Ecosystem  </p><p>AMA is responsible for developing, promoting and monitoring the implementation of usability and accessibility guidelines and regulations, ensuring compliance with national and international standards and best practices (namely WCAG 2.1 from W3C) and enabling citizens, especially those with disabilities, to access and use public services online.</p><p>To this end, AMA made available an ecosystem, aggregated in the <a href="https://www.acessibilidade.gov.pt/">acessibilidade.gov.pt</a> web portal, with information about laws, guidelines and best practices, as well as practical online tools for public entities, which include:</p><ul><li>An accessibility and usability kit for public sector’s websites (with all resources available on <a href="https://github.com/amagovpt/Usabilidade-Gov-PT">Github</a>); </li><li>An accessibility WCAG 2.1 validator;</li><li>An accessibility statement generator; and</li><li>A usability and accessibility seal of excellence.</li></ul><p>The <a href="https://selo.usabilidade.gov.pt/">Usability and Accessibility Seal</a>, in particular, is an indicator of the quality of the contents and services made available online by public and also private entities, according to three levels of compliance with standard requirements: Bronze seal (lowest level of conformity, i.e. to level 1 requirements), Silver seal (intermediate level of conformity) and Gold seal (highest level of conformity).</p><p class="subtitle">App.gov.pt</p><p><a href="https://www.app.gov.pt/Application/All?language=pt-PT&amp;store=1&amp;privacy=all">App.gov.pt</a> was launched in 2018 as a directory of mobile apps that centralised various applications made available by the public administration to make life easier for citizens.

On the web portal, users can consult their tax files and statistics, and conduct simulations. In addition, a complimentary app was made available in 2018 to facilitate the payment of taxes and the consultation of the citizen’s fiscal status.   </p><p>Advanced functionalities were recently integrated into the system allowing for enhanced usability, the most notable being the automated income tax declaration. The pre-filling of the declaration already began several years ago, culminating in the current fully automated procedure, in which the personal income tax can be settled without any intervention by the taxpayer. Developed as a SIMPLEX measure, this feature automatically prefills the citizen’s income statement with all relevant data conforming to data protection regulations. Then, the declaration receipts and the notification of the final tax calculation can be confirmed electronically. </p><p class="subtitle">National Health System </p><p>Available since 2016, the <a href="https://www.sns.gov.pt/">National Health System (NHS) Portal</a> provides citizens with online access to a wide range of information and services, made available by the institutions that integrate the Portuguese NHS and other institutions of the Ministry of Health. Since May 2019, the authentication on the NHS Portal is done exclusively through the Citizen Card or Digital Mobile Key eID mechanisms. The portal allows, among other functions:</p><ul><li>Consultation/download of diverse health indicators;</li><li>Access to georeferenced information about health providers; and</li><li>Access to didactic materials on health literacy.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, the Citizen’s Area of the NHS Portal integrates electronic health records, facilitating the sharing of information between citizens, health professionals and public health entities. With the aim of providing several digital public services in one place, the Citizen’s Area allows, among other services, to: </p><ul><li>Schedule consultations of primary care, including telehealth;</li><li>Access real-time teleconsultations via the RSE Live Platform (also available via the mobile app <a href="https://www.sns.gov.pt/apps/mysns-carteira-eletronica-da-saude/">MySNS Carteira</a>), implemented throughout the NHS for primary and hospital health care;</li><li>Consult exams;</li><li>Request a digital declaration of attendance at a consultation;</li><li>Activate electronic notifications (via SMS) whenever an accredited health professional consults the patient’s registered clinical information;</li><li>Request the exemption from user fees; and</li><li>Renew chronic medication.</li></ul><p>The NHS Portal also includes the <a href="https://www.sns.gov.pt/transparencia/">National Health System Transparency Portal</a>, which centralises the data produced by the health care entities in a digital and accessible platform, so that this information can be analysed and reused without any restriction by the general population.</p><p>Importantly, the provision of health services is omnichannel and, in addition to the features made available on the NHS Portal, includes:</p><ul><li><a id="_Hlk66955761"></a><a id="_Hlk66956191"></a>The mobile application <a href="https://www.sns.gov.pt/apps/mysns-carteira-eletronica-da-saude/">MySNS Carteira</a>, allowing the portability of citizens’ health information and enabling real-time teleconsultations, just as the NHS Portal;</li><li>The onsite <a href="https://www.sns24.gov.pt/guia/sns-24-balcao/">SNS24 Balcão</a>, a physical space that facilitates citizens’ access to the various digital services of the NHS and that relies on an enhanced partnership with local municipalities; and</li><li>The <a href="https://www.sns24.gov.pt/">SNS24</a> hotline, a single contact point (phone, email and web) which provides citizens with a set of information and services that facilitate access, ensure equity and simplify the use of the NHS. This hotline includes, since April 2020, a digital service for deaf people provided through video call by six Portuguese sign language interpreters who provide assistance 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. After contact between the deaf citizen and the interpreter, the latter mediates with the health professional at the NHS Contact Centre through a voice response platform. This new functionality could also be used to ensure communication between health professionals and the deaf patient during hospital admission or interactions at the health centre.</li></ul><p>In the context of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to highlight the role of SNS24 in promoting the issuance of <a href="https://covid19.min-saude.pt/dpip/">provisional declarations of prophylactic isolation</a> in an electronic and dematerialised format. Furthermore, the SNS24 ‘<a href="https://www.sns24.gov.pt/avaliar-sintomas/">Evaluate Symptoms</a>’ functionality was improved to cover COVID-19 so as to allow citizens to evaluate their symptoms, and obtain information and advice regarding non-emergent health problems, thus optimizing the screening.</p><p>More in general, the use of digital health technologies has proven to be important to improve access to health services, reduce costs, raise the quality of care and increase the efficiency of health systems.

To this end, the Direct Social Security Portal currently offers over 250 digital services, including the possibility to request pensions and social benefits, consult and update information on a citizen’s contribution career and obtain an integrated overview of all credits and debits. For employers and independent workers, the main services that allow them to fulfil their obligations to Social Security are also available.

Among the initiatives developed in this context, the following stand out: </p><ul><li>The Network of Innovators is a community of practices, with 675 members, aiming to promote collaborative work sessions among public administration workers to share knowledge and experiences resulting from projects and/or experimental approaches. The network has at its disposal two instruments to promote its dynamisation: (i) LabXpresso, a bimonthly newsletter where projects, case studies and tools applied by the LabX team are presented; and (ii) WORKSHOP@LabX, face-to-face or virtual sessions that take place in an informal environment and can have different formats, where participants can identify challenges and opportunities for innovation within the public administration;</li><li>The Network of Experimentation Labs is an initiative in which public administration teams are given project-based training to apply in rapid prototyping cycles. They use LabX’s approach to materialise experimental projects (with a duration of up to six months), which allows these teams to accelerate transformational proposals, for both public service delivery and public sector organisations. The Network of Experimentation Labs allows to develop a ‘belt of multipliers’ which will promote and scale innovation within the public administration.</li><li>At the moment, LabX has been working with four teams of public entities of local government (three municipalities and a central organisation) through established partnerships based on protocols. </li></ul><p class="subtitle">Collaborative Work Plan Network</p><p>The Collaborative Work Plan is a framework for collaborative projects emerging organically from public leaders, aiming to tackle difficult challenges and deliver results through combined efforts and resources from several organisations, including from universities and not-for-profit organisations. The network is growing, delivering three collaborative work plans in a year, and expanding the ‘Commitment to collaborate’ signed by the involved leaders.</p><p class="subtitle">Citizen Shops</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ama.gov.pt/web/english/citizen-shop">Citizen Shops</a> are a concept of public service delivery that combines in the same physical space several public and private entities. It does so with the aim of expediting relations between citizens, companies and the public administration.</p><p>The establishment of the first Citizen Shops took place in 1999 in Lisbon and Oporto. Their opening was the first step in the direction of the one-stop-shop concept for public service delivery, since citizens now have access to a wide range of public and private services in the same place. </p><p>This model has been continuously developed to respond to the evolving needs of citizens and companies. Examples include the availability of free Wi-Fi and the possibility to automatically assess, through QR code or free SMS, the services provided in the shops. </p><p>As of 9 March 2021, the network of Citizen Shops comprises 59 one-stop-shops.</p><p class="subtitle">Citizen Spots </p><p>The <a href="https://www.ama.gov.pt/web/english/citizen-spot">Citizen Spot</a> is a multiservice physical counter where a specialised mediator assists citizens in accessing a portfolio of digital public services and further teaches them how to operate autonomously thereafter.</p><p>The services provided are essentially those already available on various websites, but some citizens may not feel capable or comfortable to use them by themselves. They include civil registration documents, forms to request the European Health Insurance Card, the Tax Authority’s land registry, social security and tax services, just to name a few.</p><p>All spots are equipped with a double-screen system (one screen for the mediator and one for the citizen) that allows citizens to follow the steps being taken by the mediator. The service is provided in a completely transparent way, allowing the citizen to learn and control all the steps and procedures done by the assistant and hence reducing the chances for abuse of power/corruption to virtually zero. </p><p>Moreover, all the operations are supported by the electronic identification tools developed by AMA, namely the PIN-protected Citizen Card and the Digital Mobile Key, thus strengthening the citizens’ trust in digital services and helping them understand the emphasis put on rights to privacy, data and consumer protection.</p><p>The combination of public digital services with the onsite assistance of a specialised mediator, in a brand-new hybrid model of service delivery, has proven to be an effective way to engage citizens in the use of digital services. It makes everyone more aware of the available services and their respective benefits, and also of online security, which is fundamental to boost public confidence in the use of ICTs in general. </p><p>As of 9 March 2021, there were 742 spots located in town halls, parishes or public libraries throughout the country (aiming to be close to citizens of all backgrounds) and also in the cities of São Paulo (Brazil), Paris (France), Brussels (Belgium) and London (UK), providing more than 230 services with nearly 7 million attendances. </p><p>The Citizen Spot concept was extended with the launch of (i) the Solidarity Citizen Spot, which specifically targets day-care centres, nursing homes and residential structures for the elderly, and comprises the operation of mobile kits by a trained mediator; and (ii) the Mobile Citizen Spot, which foresees the use of minivans to provide digital assistance in remote locations or in catastrophic situations (this project was first mobilised to the areas affected by the fires that occurred in Portugal in the summer of 2017).</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Interoperability Platform of the Public Administration</p><p>The <a href="http://www.iap.gov.pt/">Interoperability Platform of the Public Administration (iAP) </a>is a services-oriented central platform that aims to make available to all public administrations a shared tool that allows multichannel services for citizens and enterprises. The iAP comprises four independent services: (i) the ‘Integration Platform’ provides a simple and integrated delivery of cross-cutting electronic services, becoming a cornerstone in the administrative modernisation process; (ii) the ‘Authentication Supplier’ allows authentication using the Citizen Card in portals duly accredited and authorised for that purpose; (iii) the ‘Payments Platform’ enables the availability and integrated management of multiple payment methods for different channels; and (iv) the ‘SMS Gateway’ enables the sending and receiving of SMSs via short numbers between citizens and public administration bodies, thus enlarging the number of available contact channels for managing the relationship with citizens.</p><p>This shared tool for interconnection between different systems enables the provision of digital public services like dematerialised medical ePrescriptions (mandatory and fully electronic since 2016) and the automated social energy fare (automatically processing social benefits related to the energy bill by integrating data from Social Security).</p><p>The public administration’s interoperability platform has been progressively extended to the private sector, enabling the provision of services such as the dematerialised bank account opening, available since July 2018 and allowing banks and financial companies to obtain data on the professional situation of potential clients in a totally dematerialised way.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.iap.gov.pt/">iAP’s website</a> was completely revamped in 2020, with the aim to improve the communication of the services available, and the main figures and benefits. Also in 2020, the national eDelivery access point was connected to iAP, which will allow the implementation of several cross-border projects. During the first half of 2021, iAP will reach a total of 2 billion messages interchanged since 2007, a number that is increasing each year.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>Traffic Exchange Point</p><p>The <a href="https://dre.pt/pesquisa/-/search/543701/details/maximized">Resolution of the Council of Ministers No. 12/2012</a>, of 7 February 2012, approved the Global Plan for Rationalisation and Cost Reduction concerning ICT in the public administration, establishing a set of ground rules to rationalise the ICT assets used by the Portuguese government. </p><p>With regard to consolidated ICT solutions, as per Decree-Law No. 151/2015, of 6 August 2015, it was decided to build an infrastructure that supports (voice and data) communications between the public entities, in a private, secure environment and without the service-fee charged by commercial providers, i.e. a Traffic Exchange Point (PTT) that guarantees direct access to all public entities while promoting a better service and secure, faster and easier access, with lower costs.</p><p>The implementation of the PTT is still progressing towards the designated goal of covering the whole public sector: the backbone link between the ICT entities of each one of the ministries was achieved in early 2019, with more than 25 different services made available for common use. The rollout process will continue during the next years with the implementation of an increasing number of new services in the PTT. </p><p class="subtitle">Logistics Single Window </p><p>In 2020, the <a href="https://www.projeto-jul.pt/">Logistics Single Window (LSW)</a> was implemented, leading the national ports to be integrated into a computer network for administrative simplification, dematerialisation of documents, and optimisation and standardisation of procedures.

Since December 2017, citizens can also use a Digital Mobile Key app for receiving the one-time password associated with each authentication through push notifications on their smartphones. More recently, in April 2018, the Digital Mobile Key was upgraded with a remote qualified signature feature, according to the eIDAS Regulation.</p><p>The main objective is offering a complementary authentication solution through mobile devices, safer than the access via username and password (ensuring more security to the State) and simpler to the citizen (ensuring more effectiveness and efficiency to citizens and companies). As of March 2021, more than 2.4 million citizens have already been enrolled in the Digital Mobile Key system.</p><p>The eID scheme concerning the Digital Mobile Key was published in <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2020:116:FULL">OJEU 2020/C 116/01</a> with a ‘high’ Level of Assurance.  </p><p class="subtitle">ID.gov.pt</p><p>The <a href="https://id.gov.pt/">ID.gov.pt</a> app is a digital wallet available for iOS and Android that allows citizens to view, save and share certified versions of personal identification documents. The digital documents generated by the app, which requires secure authentication via the eIDAS-compliant Digital Mobile Key, have the same legal value as the original paper versions, and can be validated by public and private authorities in real time through a QR code available in the application or through the insertion of a temporary code in a reserved area of Autenticacao.gov.pt.</p><p>The undisputable identification of citizens is essential for the good provision of services.

Without this toolset, the output of these jobs would be, in most cases, outdated at birth.</p><p><img src="img/35-656.jpeg" alt="35-656.jpeg" /></p><p>	Cross-border </p><p>Digital Public Administration Services </p><p>7</p><p>	</p><h1><a id="_Toc39569814"></a>Cross-border Digital Public Administration Services for Citizens and Businesses</h1><p>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad.
