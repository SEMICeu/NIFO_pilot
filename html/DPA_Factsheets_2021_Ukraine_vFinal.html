The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><img src="img/35-526.png" alt="35-526.png" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main components (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation.

Ukraine scores above the European average for the Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility), both with a maximal score of 4, and meets the European average for every other principle. The mid-upper performance of Ukraine for Principle 12 indicates that Ukrainian public administrations could improve their evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits (Recommendation 19).  </p><img src="img/35-539.jpeg" alt="35-539.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Ukrainian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show a good performance.

Higher than the European average, Ukraine obtains a maximal score of 4 for both external information sources and services. In order to reach a higher performance in catalogues, a potential area of improvement could be to enhance the implementation of Recommendation 44, on the provision of catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions and the use of common models for describing them.</p><p>Additional information on Ukraine’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>This section of the factsheet is meant to presents the country performance on the main eGovernment indicators according to the latest eGovernment Benchmark report, which monitors the development of eGovernment in Europe. </p><p> </p><p>At the present moment, the report does not analyse the state of play of eGovernment in Ukraine. </p><img src="img/35-552.jpeg" alt="35-552.jpeg" /><p>	 Digital Public Administration Highlights </p><p>2</p><h1><a id="_Hlk34322211"></a><a id="_Toc34385557"></a>Digital Public Administration Highlights</h1><p class="subtitle">Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><p>In December 2020, the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine (MDT) presented the updated <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w4aPsZ93Xr6CGMACsaGFAZ137ivtvMgi/view">roadmap on integration of Ukraine into EU digital single market</a> for 2021-2023.

The document provided the MDT’s vision on the digital infrastructure development and the key objectives of digital transformation in Ukraine. While developing this concept note, the experts used a multi-stakeholder approach. By doing so, the main purpose of State authorities was to determine, prioritise, and coordinate the stakeholders’ interests. The draft concept underlines three priorities to be achieved by 2023. These priorities are:</p><ul><li>The enhancement of public eServices; </li><li>The development of broadband internet connections; and</li><li>The implementation of innovative technologies and optical networks. 	</li></ul><p>The enhancement of public eServices aims to facilitate the delivery of eServices to both citizens and businesses. The digitalisation of business processes in public bodies will simplify the interaction between citizens, businesses and the State, resulting in higher efficiency. </p><p>The broadband development represents the basis for the development of public digital infrastructure. In order to ensure the demand of broadband connections, the MDT insists on prioritising the connection of social infrastructure to the broadband (i.e. schools, libraries, museums, healthcare institutions, administrative service offices etc.). </p><p>The implementation of innovative technologies and optical networks is paramount to enable the development of the 5<sup>th</sup> generation connection in Ukraine.

Per the calculations based on the 23 analysed registries, the State spent an average UAH 21 million (approximately EUR 713,000) per year on the maintenance of each registry. The report stressed problems on the interconnection of base registries and the lack of proper identifiers (low level of distribution of digital ID numbers among citizens and lack of the identifiers in existing State registries). The report included a list of recommendations for improvements, i.e. readying State registries for their integration into the national interoperability system, distribution of unique registration numbers (UNRs), development and adoption of the law regulating development, functionality and maintenance of State registries, prevention from State registries data fragmentation and duplication, efficiency improvement of IT infrastructure management for State bodies.</p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>eHealth Action Plan</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kmu.gov.ua/storage/app/sites/1/17-prezentation-2019/10.2019/plan-zahodiv.pdf">eHealth Action Plan</a> was approved on 1 October 2019.

The Diia State eServices portal with its User's eCabinet was introduced in April 2020. This is an entirely new approach to the eService delivery system. This platform contains both an eServices portal (one-stop-shop platform) and an information system (middleware, or process engine). The platform provides citizens and businesses with comprehensive information on available State eServices and gives them the opportunity to obtain high-quality eServices based on a unique service design. As of March 2021, there are more than 50 eServices available on the Diia portal. During the year after its launch, the portal was visited by 3,8 million unique users. The main concept behind the creation of the User’s eCabinet is to provide a single point of entry allowing citizens to access and retrieve information about themselves. The User’s eCabinet will not store any personal data. Instead, it will display current information about the citizen from State registries and provide convenient access to other eCabinets and services without the need for additional authorisation. The User’s eCabinet will be a component within the State eServices platform. The eCabinet will also track changes and automatically notify citizens if and when their personal information has been altered or deleted. In situations where unauthorised changes have been made to personal information, the user will be able to react in a timely manner and rectify the situation by petitioning the relevant government entity responsible for the data, or by appealing to a court against the unauthorised activity. As of March 2021, there are nine public registries integrated into the User’s eCabinet on the Diia portal and thus, inside the portal’s eCabinet, registered users can find information about their vehicle ownership, land ownership, immovable property ownership and private entrepreneurship status, information about their debts (if any), voter information as well as employment records. The MDT will continue integrating more registries into the User’s eCabinet. </p><p class="subtitle">State Mobile Application Diia </p><p>The <a href="https://go.diia.app/">Diia mobile application</a> was introduced two months before the Portal, in February 2020. The first user-friendly eServices contained in the Diia mobile application are nine digital documents (i.e., electronic driver licence, electronic vehicle registration document (vehicle technical passport), Ukrainian ID (ID card), Ukrainian passports for traveling abroad, student ID, car insurance, individual tax number, birth certificate and internally displaced persons certificate). Moreover, the Diia mobile application contains such eServices as obtaining information about traffic violations tickets and paying for them as well as information about users administrative debts and payment for them directly from Diia mobile app. In total, the Diia mobile application was downloaded more than 5 million times. </p><p class="subtitle">Public Services Guide on the Diia Portal </p><p>On 27 August 2020, the MDT launched the <a href="https://guide.diia.gov.ua/">Public Services Guide</a> on the Diia eServices Portal. The guide is a registry of Administrative Services and one of the Diia portal’s modules. It is a single database of administrative services designed to provide full and accurate information about public services. Previously, there was no clear understanding of the actual number of public services available or how to obtain them. Moreover, a single service could go by different names, and State authorities could demand different documents from citizens in order to provide the same service. This would create opportunities for petty corruption and waste citizens’ time and resources. Each service in the registry is assigned a unique code that is used when users receive services through the Diia portal and in ASCs. </p><p>When necessary, the registry also allows administrators to insert or edit the service description, and the registry contains a search function based on classifiers (i.e. categories, State entities, documents, results, life events, grounds for refusal). Currently, the guide contains information on over 1,600 public services (including electronic and paper-based services). The data on these services is divided into 17 categories of business activities and is arranged among 36 life events (e.g. starting a business, changing your place of residence, having a baby, or buying a vehicle; you can find all the information about where to obtain these services, their price, terms, etc. in the guide). The guide provides citizens and businesses with easily searchable and credible information about the services as well as how to obtain them.  </p><p class="subtitle">Diia.Business Platform</p><p>In February 2020, the MDT launched a test online platform for entrepreneurs called <a href="https://business.diia.gov.ua/en">Diia.Business</a>. The Diia.Business website is a one-stop-shop — the only place where potential and active entrepreneurs can get all the information to develop their own business. The Diia.Business website has lots of functions and useful digital services for potential and existing entrepreneurs. Here you can find opportunities, over 200 services, online courses, cases and news, suggestions from partners, a map of business support infrastructure, and more.

The <a href="https://www.minfin.gov.ua/en">Ministry of Finance</a> of Ukraine performs regular monitoring of the Single Window functionality and improvements, so that it can be more accessible and useful for businesses.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>National Identification System </p><p>The <a href="https://id.gov.ua/">National Identification System</a> ensures the procedures of personal identification for users of different online services.

Fully implemented in 2016 as a hybrid system (containing both centralised public and decentralised private marketplaces), it has since been globally recognised as one of the most innovative public procurement systems delivering government services in a stakeholder-focused, transparent, effective, fair and low-cost way.</p><p>The system is managed by the Ministry for Development of Economy, Trade and Agriculture of Ukraine. According to the law <a href="https://zakon5.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/922-19">on Public Procurement</a>, <a href="https://prozorro.gov.ua">the</a> ProZorro portal is an open resource that has been providing access to database information on electronic tenders since July 2016. This system is obligatory for all State ordering customers. State organisations acting as ordering customers publish bid opportunities via the module of electronic auction, having registered themselves on authorised electronic platforms. This module ensures the transfer of information to the central database and simultaneously publishes it on the portal and other platforms. The portal database and the module of electronic auction create the single system of electronic public procurement ProZorro. Starting from the launch of the system, more than UAH 150 billion (around EUR 4.7 billion) of State budget were saved thanks to ProZorro. </p><p class="subtitle">DOZORRO</p><p>The monitoring platform <a href="https://dozorro.org/">DOZORRO</a> is a national public procurement watchdog portal that allows users to provide feedback on any procurement procedure, tender, etc. In 2020, the <a href="https://dozorro.org/community/ngo">Dozorro watchdog community</a> analysed 6,421 red flag tenders. Each high-risk tender was brought to the attention of the public purchaser, their managing entity and their oversight authorities through formal letters. Following the analyses, 6,270 tenders were brought to the attention of oversight authorities, public purchasers and their managing entities through formal complaints. 1,385 high-risk tenders (22% of the total analysed) were fixed as a result.</p><p>The DOZORRO regional community published 101 guidelines on how to use procurement monitoring instruments (such as <a href="https://bi.prozorro.org/sense/app/fba3f2f2-cf55-40a0-a79f-b74f5ce947c2/sheet/HbXjQep/state/analysis#view/q6zpiXHy">BI Prozorro</a> and the DOZORRO portal) and how to best apply them in order to be able to extract value from open data. The DOZORRO risk indicator system has the option of filtering tenders according to specific risks or groups of risk indicators. The system includes 40 AI-powered risk indicators that can point out the likelihood of corruption in a particular tender.</p><p class="subtitle">ProZorro Sale</p><p><a href="https://prozorro.sale/">Prozorro Sale</a> is a system designed for the transparent, fast and effective sales of State and communal property, as well as for fighting against corruption through equal access to data, public control and by increasing the number of potential buyers.</p><h2>ePayment</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474997"></a>National Online Platform for Digital Literacy </p><p>The <a href="https://osvita.diia.gov.ua/">National Online Platform for Digital Literacy </a>has been developed with the aim of digitally educating at least 6 million Ukrainians. The key learning approach of the platform relies on educational series. The platform currently contains 51 educational series (i.e. basic digital literacy, digital literacy for teachers, and series for parents – and on an educational series for kids, namely online security for kids, specialised courses for entrepreneurs, lifestyle courses, and courses on new digital professions etc.). More than 500,000 unique users have passed at least one course. While producing the series, the MDT experts used European standards of teaching and evaluation of digital competences. For instance, the basic digital literacy series was developed on the Digital Competence Framework for citizens DigComp. Moreover, the platform contains a free test <em>tsyfrogram</em> on general digital literacy that helps to find out one’s level of digital literacy. </p><p class="subtitle">Knowledge Management Educational Portal for Civil Servants</p><p>The <a href="https://pdp.nacs.gov.ua/">portal</a> was launched to foster the professional development of civil servants at national and municipal levels. It is a web space for convenient communication between civil servants looking for professional development and the educational services providers. Via the portal, civil servants can find the educational programmes for their personal development in different categories such as European integration, anti-corruption, decentralisation etc. Currently, there are more than 300 educational programmes available on the portal. </p><p class="subtitle">Single State Electronic Database on Education </p><p>This <a href="https://info.edbo.gov.ua/">database</a> collects, registers, processes, stores and protects data related to education. According to the <a href="https://zakon.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/2145-19">Law on Education</a>, the database contains four registries: the registry of educational institutions, the registry of educational documents, the registry of independent external assessment certificates, and the registry of student ID cards. Hence, users can check the validity of their diplomas and academic credentials and the validity of their ID cards. Additionally, users can find information about their educational establishment and its licence. One more feature of the system is the opportunity for users to find information on admissions, including the ratings of those that submitted the documents to universities and were recommended for enrolment etc. At the end of 2020, 1,132 higher educational establishments and 1,248 vocational and technical institutions were registered in the system.</p><p class="subtitle">eHealth Information System</p><p><a href="https://ehealth.gov.ua/">eHealth</a> is an information system that allows patients to receive high-quality medical assistance from healthcare centres and monitor the efficiency of the State budget.

This information system was designed for the registration, accumulation, processing, analysis and storage of information about State registries and information systems. The RoR contains data on the composition, content, location and conditions to have access to these electronic information resources. The creation of such a system allows for the efficient and timely analysis of State registries, as well as the information systems in central ministries, their departments and subordinate agencies. Its capability helps to prevent an increasing duplication of data while improving the efficiency of how State information is used. </p><p>According to the draft law <a href="http://w1.c1.rada.gov.ua/pls/zweb2/webproc4_1?pf3511=64437">on Public Electronic Registries</a>, the four basic registries include: the State demographic registry, the business registry, the State registry of immovable property rights, and the State land cadastre.</p><h2>Emerging Technologies</h2><p>No particular emerging technology has been reported to date.</p><p>	</p><img src="img/35-900.jpeg" alt="35-900.jpeg" /><p>	Cross-border </p><p>Digital Public Administration Services </p><p>7</p><h1><a id="_Toc34385562"></a>Cross-border Digital Public Administration Services</h1><p>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad.
