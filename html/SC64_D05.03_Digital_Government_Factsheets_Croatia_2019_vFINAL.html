The Strategy was made in accordance with already applicable strategies and Croatian laws, professional Recommendations and Directives from the European Union, primarily from the Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE), as the first of the seven flagship initiatives within the programme of Europe 2020.</p><p>The aim was to create a coherent, logical and efficient information system of the state by providing high quality and cost-effective eServices both at national and European levels. It ensured interoperability between existing and new ICT systems in the public administration, while at the same time eliminating the duplication of their functionality. The achievement of its objectives will be measured based on the percentage of citizens and businesses using public eServices and the level of customer satisfaction.</p><p>In addition to national resources, the Strategy partly relied on European Union funds reserved for the 2014-2020 period. </p><p class="subtitle">The Programme of the Croatian Government for the Period 2016 – 2020 </p><p>The <a href="https://vlada.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/ZPPI/Dokumenti Vlada/Program_Vlada_RH_2016_2020.pdf">Programme for the period 2016-2020</a>, developed by the Government of the Republic of Croatia, represented a systematic and methodical overview of instruments the Government used to achieve political stability, legal security, economic growth and social solidarity. As part of the Programme, efforts were made to achieve a functional and accessible public administration and further digitisation. Further, for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of institutions, measures included the simplification of rules and acceleration of the work of administration through the digitisation of all processes for the purpose of expanding eServices to citizens and businesses, interconnecting all state administration bodies and establishing a uniform manner of communication between citizens and state administration bodies. </p><p>One of the Programme’s objectives relating to public administration was the accomplishment of the digitisation of public services as a specific objective. The plan involved establishing a Central Government Information System, optimisation of resources, centralised management of all information systems and services in one place, and the introduction and use of eID for all citizens. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Open Data Policy</p><p>On 19 July 2018, the Government of the Republic of Croatia adopted the <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/SDURDD-dokumenti/POLITIKA OTVORENIH PODATAKA.pdf">Open Data Policy</a>. The Open Data Policy provided the strategic direction for further development of the policy of openness and transparency of public administration.

The main purpose of the strategy was to achieve a systematic and coordinated implementation of the activities necessary for improving Croatia’s capabilities in the area of cyber security, with a view to building a safe society in cyberspace. The goal of the strategy was to take advantage of the full market potential of information society as a whole, and especially of cyber security products and services. </p><p>Recognising the importance of security of cyberspace as a shared responsibility of all<br />segments of society, in October 2015 the Croatian Government adopted a <a href="http://www.uvns.hr/en/legislation/national-security">Cyber Security Strategy</a> together with an Action Plan. Its purpose was systematic and coordinated implementation of activities necessary to raise the capacity of the Republic of Croatia in the field of cybernetic security, in order to build a safe society in cyberspace. The aim of this Strategy was also the use of market potential of the information society in general and, in particular, products and cyber security services. Since it was the first comprehensive Strategy in the Republic of Croatia in the field of cybernetic security, the primary objective was to identify organisational problems in its implementation and disseminated an understanding of the importance of this issue in society. Encouraging the coordination and cooperation of all state bodies and legal persons with public authorities, but also other sectors of society, it was necessary in order to establish new functionalities, raise the efficiency of relevant stakeholders, use more existing resources effectively, planning usage needs better and realising new resources.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle">The Public Administration Development Strategy 2015 – 2020</p><p>The <a href="http://infoz.ffzg.hr/INFuture/2015/images/papers/1-05 Lepri, Croatian Strategy for the Development of Public Administration 2015-20.pdf">Public Administration Development Strategy 2015 – 2020</a> was adopted by the Croatian Parliament in June 2015. The Strategy presented a strategic framework for public administration development and an orientation towards enhancing administrative capacities and a better organisation of public administration. The development of a modern public administration was conducted in three main directions: the simplification and modernisation of administrative procedures to ensure the reliable and fast support of public administration to citizens and economic entities, the improvement of the development and management of human resources with the aim of creating a modern public service and reforming the administrative system to align it with European Standards.  </p><p>Taking into account the need to harmonise the Action Plan with the Public Administration Development Strategy 2015 – 2020, the Government Programme 2016 – 2020 and the prerequisites for the fulfilment of ex ante conditionalities, the Croatian Government adopted The Action Plan for the implementation of the Public Administration Development Strategy 2017 – 2020 in December 2016.</p><p class="subtitle">National Health Care Strategy 2012 - 2020</p><p><a href="https://zdravlje.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/Programi, projekti i strategije/Skracena Nacionalna strategija razvoja zdravstva - HRV - za web.pdf">National Health Care Strategy 2012-2020 i</a>s the umbrella document determining the context, vision, priorities, goals and key measures in health care in the Republic of Croatia in the period. The time horizon until 2020 was selected because it provides sufficient time for implementation and evaluation of the strategic measures, and it coincides with key strategic documents of the European Union (EU) and World Health Organisation (WHO).</p><p>Part of this strategy focuses on the Informatisation and eHealth within the Central Health Care Information System in Croatia (CEZIH). CEZIH, with more than 17,000 users and a large number of information systems makes a good basis for informatisation of the entire health care system in Croatia. On 2 January 2011, ePrescription was introduced and complete national coverage was achieved, which was a significant step towards achieving a “paperless office”. On 15 January 2011, full national coverage of eReferral was achieved for biochemical laboratories, and since then millions of electronic referrals and results of laboratory examinations have been exchanged in the system. Another effect of modernisation was the increase in information technology literacy among health care workers. Overall there were five key purposes of the informatisation of the health care in Croatia:</p><p>To contribute directly to the improvement of health care service quality, safety and consistency.</p><p>To provide better communication between all participants in the health care through central management of patients’ data, in primary, secondary and tertiary care (electronic medical record), centralised managing of processes in the health care system (e.g. eAppointment) and connecting all health care registers.</p><p>To achieve complete availability of the health care to patients through quick and secure access to their own health record, as well as to information on health services and the quality of health care.</p><p>To enhance administration efficiency and improve the management of the health care system by building an advanced reporting system, including all data in the health care system. This would support health care authorities and decision makers and allow for a more efficient spending of resources.</p><p>To align the health system with the political goals of digitalisation of the public sector and provision of electronic services to the population, in coordination with other state administration bodies and in accordance with the strategy of the Republic of Croatia and eCroatia.</p><p class="subtitle">eJustice</p><p>Strengthening the efficiency of the judiciary was one of the objectives in the <a href="https://pravosudje.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/Strategije, planovi, izvjeÅ¡Äa/Planovi/StrateÅ¡ki plan Ministarstva pravosuÄa za razdoblje 2019 do 2021..pdf">Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Justice for the period 2019-2021</a>, emphasising the use of solutions based on complex algorithms and artificial intelligence in order to increase the efficiency of the proceedings. Also, electronic communication in courts is advancing and currently all commercial courts are now equipped for eCommunication with lawyers, notaries and prosecutors. Online payment of Court fees is incentivised by offering a 50 % discount in case of immediate payment and online submission of a claim. As of 2019, personal and corporate insolvency documents should be delivered from the Financial Agency to the courts electronically.

Through the pilot project, the schools are equipped with LAN, digital classrooms and tablets. Digital educational content and drafts for STEM subjects were made for primary schools and high schools. eServices of digital educational content repositories, education organisation applications, classroom management system, and an IT system for computerisation of the business of the institution were created. The framework for digital maturity of schools and the digital competence of principals, teachers and professional associates were developed. Due to the success of the first phase of the "eSchool" project, the second phase of the project is being rolled out for the remaining schools in 2019.

The process of informatisation in the Republic of Croatia has so far been characterised by partial solutions, which met the needs of various domains of public administration, without interoperability of the whole system, which has negative consequences on the provision of eServices. For this reason, the adoption of the Law on State Information Infrastructure, the <a href="https://uprava.gov.hr/strategija-e-hrvatska-2020/14630">Strategy of e-Croatia 2020</a> and the related <a href="https://uprava.gov.hr/strategija-e-hrvatska-2020/14630">Action Plan</a>, first established the legislative framework, and subsequently the objectives of the new electronic administration activities. Priority was given to customer satisfaction, rationalisation of administrative procedures and the preparation and provision of modern eServices in order to improve the quality of life of citizens and the consequent further growth of the Croatian economy. Such integrated informatisation supports the implementation of an optimal state model by creating and developing new public services as well as enabling citizens, entrepreneurs and the public administration to access electronic services as useful, simple, accessible and secure tools, compatible with different technologies.</p><p>The National Information Infrastructure Act is the basis for interoperability, implementing the eCitizens system as a one-stop-shop for eServices in the virtual world, and a portal providing access to public sector information.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Statement on Cooperation for Artificial Intelligence</p><p>In July 2018, Minister of Economy, Entrepreneurship and Crafts signed a Statement on Cooperation in the field of artificial intelligence.

This provided a recognition of electronic identities of Croatian citizens to access cross-border public services in the EU online.</p><p>In this way, all the prerequisites for login to public eServices that will be provided in other Member States for Croatian citizens with the Croatian Electronic Identity Card (eOI) are fulfilled. Currently, technical connection of the infrastructure is in progress, but all prerequisites, including a detailed check of the technical security criteria, have been met. Among the first cross-border services that Croatian citizens can access with their eID card will be German services, and soon all other services of the countries (Sweden, Italy, Spain, Estonia, Luxembourg and Belgium) who have successfully configured their systems for providing electronic public services. </p><p>It is also possible for some EU citizens (from countries which have completed the notification process) to access the electronic services of the Croatian administration.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Metaregistry</p><p>The <a href="https://metaregistar.gov.hr/metareg/html/">Metaregistry</a> is a public register which is part of the SII and is used to control the system of all public registers. It contains detailed information on public registers, the data they hold, and communicates this to users through a single point. In this way, it provides an overview of the structured public registers, the type of data that is collected and hosted, as well as how to connect with other systems. The Metaregistry makes sure to be in compliance with the applicable regulations on personal data protection, data confidentiality and the right to access information. As previously mentioned, the Metaregistry is still not fully operational, but Croatia’s increased efforts in recent years should ensure its functionality at the earliest convenience.</p><p>The Metaregistry is a prerequisite for a country with ‘paperless administration’ ambitions and the realisation of the ‘once-only’ principle. A paperless state creates a single administrative location with connected registration systems to ensure the data availability. This relieves the administrative burden on citizens, who do not have to transfer documents between different institutions themselves.</p><p class="subtitle">Shared Services Centre (SSC)</p><p>According to the Decree, the SSC is an organisational business model for providing shared services to public sector bodies and other users, consisting of a normative framework and a governance structure in accordance with the Regulation and the acts adopted pursuant to this Decree. SSC provides services of common business solutions and common services of information communication technology (hereinafter ICT), and its establishment, extension, maintenance and management is within the competence of the central state administration body responsible for eCroatia affairs.  </p><p>SSC aims to increase the use of ICT in communication between citizens and public administrations through the establishment of an ICT coordination and software solution. The expected outcome is to increase the level of use of eGovernment services by citizens, which is assessed in terms of the frequency of use of eGovernment services by individuals and increasing the number of residents communicating with public institutions. Specific results to be achieved include the functioning of the state cloud and the strengthening of the use of eServices in specific sectors defined in the digital strategy, i.e. the increase in the percentage of public institutions integrated in the cloud and the number of complex eServices provided to users.</p><p class="subtitle">Cadastral data browser</p><p>The <a href="http://www.katastar.hr/dgu/ind.php">browser for cadastral data</a> provides insight into the central cadastre database of Croatia, which incorporates all cadastral offices. The eCadastre service enables checking of cadastre plots, authentication of data entries, as well as the latest data changes and documentation based on the modifications performed. </p><p class="subtitle">eCourt registry</p><p>The <a href="https://sudreg.pravosudje.hr/registar/f?p=150:1">eCourt registry</a> contains all entities that are being founded, including trading companies, co-ops and institutions. Through automation of certain administrative and accounting judicial operations and access to criminal and minor offence records, it enables simpler registration of business entities (full online company registration) and simpler access to court registry data.</p><p class="subtitle">eCREW</p><p>The <a href="https://eplovilo.pomorstvo.hr/">eCREW system</a> enables all legal and natural entities who rent yachts and boats to register, prior to putting out to sea, their crew and passengers via the Internet using smart cards with a digital certificate based on acquired user rights. The aim is to expedite business processes at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Infrastructure with business subjects (charter companies) relating to charter vessels, to secure a complete monitoring over the procedure of renting vessels by all authorised bodies of the State Administration, and in that way, prevent illegal chartering. </p><p class="subtitle">Central Database Registry on Personal Data</p><p>Registry offices in the country keep national records on registries of births, marriages and deaths. Data on citizens’ personal status is entered into local databases and replicated into the <a href="http://www.azop.hr/page.aspx?PageID=11">central registry</a> at the Ministry of Public Administration. </p><p class="subtitle">Personal Identification Number (OIB/PIN) Registry</p><p>Personal identification numbers are given to natural and legal persons. The <a href="https://oib.oib.hr/SaznajOibWeb/fizickaOsoba.html">Personal Identification Number (OIB/PIN) Registry</a> receives updates on natural persons from the registry of births, deceased and marriage registries and about legal persons from registries of non-profit institutions (8 registries) and from the court registry on legal entities. In doing so, the data exchanged gives a clear indication of changes in the life events and status of Croatia’s citizens. This information is then shared (on request basis or notification basis) with other relevant registries, such as the Pension Registry or the Tax Administration. All relevant government bodies involved in the implementation of the OIB/PIN project carry out the adjustment of its information systems in which it is necessary to include processes related to the personal identification number. The Tax Administration (which also performs duties of a Tax Registry), Land and Commercial Registries are centralised by default.</p><p class="subtitle">HITROnet</p><p><a href="https://uprava.gov.hr/o-ministarstvu/ustrojstvo/uprava-za-e-hrvatsku/aktualni-projekti/hitronet/873">HITROnet </a>is the communication system that represents the backbone of the public administration network.
