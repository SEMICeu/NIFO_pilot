Areas of improvements are mainly concentrated in the Principles 3 (Transparency), 6 (User-centricity), 9 (Multilingualism) and 10 (Administrative simplification) for which the scores of 1, 2 and 3 show a low to medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Particularly, the low degree of internal visibility and provision of external interfaces for European public services (Principle 3 – Recommendation 5) and the lack of mechanisms involving users in analysis, design, assessment and further development of European public services (Principle 6 – Recommendation 12) could be improved to enhance Montenegro’s implementation of the recommendations of Scoreboard 1. </p><img src="img/35-509.jpeg" alt="35-509.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Montenegrin results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall good performance, with majority scoring 3 and 4. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance, organisational interoperability and semantic interoperability. More specifically, the score of 1 for Montenegro in Recommendation 21, stating that processes should be put in place to select relevant standards and specifications, evaluate them, monitor their implementation, check compliance and test their interoperability and in Recommendation 28, stating that business processes should be documented using commonly accepted modelling techniques to ensure their alignment, lower the overall implementation of the recommendations related to the EIF layers for Montenegro.</p><img src="img/35-513.jpeg" alt="35-513.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Montenegro’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model, internal and external information sources and services, base registries and external information sources and services., despite the lack of data for open data and security and privacy. However, improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to the catalogues. Precisely, the lack of catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions that use common models for describing them (Recommendation 44) hinders the overall Montenegrin score on the conceptual model.</p><p>Additional information on Montenegro’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p> </p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p> </p><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

In this way, the basis was laid to harmonise business processes to comply with the European dimension in terms of provision of public services, security policies, privacy and storage of electronic records, without imposing any specific technology.</p><p>The interoperability framework is not conclusive and requires periodic adjustments in line with the technological changes that occur, the change of applicable standards, and the changes in the environment in which business processes are implemented. This is why a new <a href="http://www.mju.gov.me/ResourceManager/FileDownload.aspx?rid=398232&amp;rType=2&amp;file=Nacionalni okvir interoperabilnosti 2019.pdf">National Interoperability Framework</a> was adopted in 2019. Through its adoption, the government of Montenegro provided a set of recommendations to support the public administration in implementing interoperability activities, establishing relationships among private and public organisations, and simplifying procedures to guarantee efficient and effective digital services while ensuring that existing and new legislations do not undermine the interoperability initiative. </p><p class="subtitle">Montenegrin Health System Interoperability Framework</p><p>Although the provision of public services in almost all cases includes data exchange between information systems, interoperability is a wider concept that includes the possibility of organising joint work on commonly-agreed goals catering to shared interests. Interoperability is also a prerequisite and mitigating factor for the efficient provision of public services, and addresses the need for:</p><ul><li>Cooperation between public administration institutions;</li><li>Exchange of information to meet legal requirements;</li><li>Exchange and re-use of information to increase administrative efficiency and reduce administrative burdens on citizens and businesses; </li><li>Better provision of public services to citizens and businesses on a one-to-one principle (one-stop government); and</li><li>Reducing costs for the public administration, businesses and citizens through the effective and efficient provision of public services.</li></ul><p>The ultimate goal of the National Interoperability Framework is to ensure stable and technology-based interoperability of the public administration system, in accordance with the principles of user-oriented administration.
