The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below. </p><p> </p><img src="img/35-419.png" alt="35-419.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021 </a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Estonia in 2021.</p><img src="img/35-455.png" alt="35-455.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Estonia’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Possible areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the alignment of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies with the EIF and the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><img src="img/35-466.png" alt="35-466.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Estonian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall very strong performance with scores of 4 in each layer with the exception of the interoperability governance area. More specifically, the score of 3 for Estonia derives from Recommendation 21, stating that countries should put in place defined processes for the selection and adoption of standards and specifications and from Recommendation 23, stating that relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level should be consulted when procuring and developing IT solutions. </p><img src="img/35-476.png" alt="35-476.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Estonia’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with internal and external information sources and services, base registries, open data and catalogues. However, there is room for improvement with regard to security and privacy and the conceptual model itself, where Estonia’s score of 2 and 3 respectively, are below those of the EU average. More specifically, the use of trust services to ensure secure data exchange in public services (Security and Privacy - Recommendation 47) and the existence of a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components (Conceptual Model – Recommendation 35) hinder the overall Estonian score with regard to security and privacy and the conceptual model.</p><p>Additional information on Estonia’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1035577"></a><a id="_Toc1474948"></a>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The current version of the act can be found <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112072014051">here</a>. </p><p>The PDPA protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons with respect to the processing of their personal data, in accordance with the right of individuals to obtain freely any information that is disseminated for public use.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12909389">2008 version</a> of the act introduced several changes. First, the previous classification of personal data into three groups (non-sensitive personal data, private personal data and sensitive personal data) was replaced by two data categories, namely ‘personal data’ and ‘sensitive personal data’, with the latter being the sub-class under special protection. Second, all processed personal data are protected and registered by chief processors (i.e. controllers) with the <a href="http://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a>, the data protection supervision authority. Finally, the new PDPA extended all general principles applying to the processing of personal data to the processing of the personal identification code (the unique number assigned to every Estonian citizen and resident). </p><p>From 1 January 2015, the Data Protection Inspectorate may submit reports to the Constitutional Committee of the <em>Riigikogu</em> and to the Legal Chancellor concerning significant matters which have an extensive effect or need prompt settlement emerging in the course of supervision over compliance with the act. </p><p class="subtitle">System of Security Measures for Information Systems </p><p>On 1 January 2008, the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/13125331?leiaKehtiv">regulation</a> establishing the system of security measures for information systems used for processing the data contained in State and local government databases and related information assets entered into force. The system consists of the procedure to specify security measures, and the description of organisational, physical and IT security measures to protect data. Importantly, however, the regulation does not apply to the security of information systems processing State secrets.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474968"></a>Interconnection of Base Registries</h3><p class="subtitle">Estonian Base Registries</p><p>In Estonia, the concept of base registries has been phased out and replaced by the basic data principle. Databases are regulated by <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/529032019012/consolide">law</a> (some of them being established by government regulation in secondary laws) as primary sources of basic data, that is unique data. Hence, in Estonia all registries are base registries involving unique data collected in the respective registries.</p><p>Furthermore, the Business Registries of Estonia and Finland were interconnected with the use of the <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/state-information-system/x-tee.html">X-Road</a> infrastructure. In February 2019, the Estonian Ministry of Justice and the Finnish Patent and Registration Office signed an agreement in Helsinki, providing that data can be exchanged automatically between the Business Registries of the two countries. No amendment to the national legislation was needed to that purpose.</p><p class="subtitle">Business Registry</p><p>The Business Registry is regulated by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/128122011050?leiaKehtiv">Commercial Code</a> and its <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/504042014002/consolide">amendment</a>, establishing the basic principles of Estonian entrepreneurship and regulating the setting up of companies in the country.

The purpose of this act is to ensure the collection of the main personal data of the subjects of the Population Registry in a single database to be used by the State and local governments to perform their functions.</p><p class="subtitle">Land Registry</p><p>The Land Registry is regulated by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12769835">Land Registry Act</a>, stipulating provisions with regard to the maintenance procedure, the data content, the entries, the reservation, the documents necessary for registration, the correction of entries, access and extracts, etc.</p><p class="subtitle">Vehicle Registry</p><p>The Vehicle Registry is established by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/compare_original?id=507012014005">General Traffic Act</a>, specifying the content of the Registry, the Ministry governing it, what data it contains and who may access it.</p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">Public Procurement Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/505092017003/consolide/current">Public Procurement Act</a> came into force in May 2007, with the current version transposing the EU Directives on public procurement. The act includes legal provisions enabling the further development of eProcurement (eAuctions, Dynamic Purchasing System, eCatalogues, etc.) to offer better opportunities to reach a fully electronic procurement tendering process. </p><p>Importantly, the <a href="http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/X40095K2.htm">previous version</a> of the Public Procurement Act (October 2000) had already established rules for the eNotification of public tenders through the country’s Public Procurement State Register.</p><p class="subtitle">Act on Amendments to the Accounting Act </p><p>On 20 February 2019, the Estonian Parliament approved a bill providing that the accounting of the State was to fully switch to electronic invoicing. Starting from July 2019, the public sector could only accept eInvoices. In other words, the <a href="https://www.riigikogu.ee/tegevus/eelnoud/eelnou/667615bb-4a13-4a02-812f-550c5dedeef3/Raamatupidamise seaduse muutmise seadus">Act on Amendments to the Accounting Act</a> (795 SE), initiated by the government, made machine-processable invoices mandatory in invoicing with the public sector, aiming to reduce the workload and the time required in invoicing within the public sector. The act also transposed the EU Directive on eInvoicing. An electronic invoice is a machine‑readable document drawn up on the basis of a common standard, sent from one software system to another to avoid entering data by hand.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474969"></a>Domain-Specific Legislation</h2><p class="subtitle">Information Society Services Act </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/504112013008/consolide/current">Information Society Services Act</a> was passed on 14 April 2004 and entered into force on 1 May 2004, implementing <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML">Directive 2000/31/EC on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market</a>.

The business account is aimed at small companies (one-man private limited companies and self-employed persons) in order for them to operate without bureaucracy. In particular, the act enables a natural person to open a business account with 20% of the balance automatically transferred to the Tax and Customs Board. Therefore, the account holders disclose themselves to the Tax and Customs Board and, in return, need not submit annual reports and tax returns.</p><p class="subtitle">Principles for Managing Services and Governing Information </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/507072017004/consolide/current">Principles for Managing Services and Governing Information</a> (a government regulation) entered into force in March 2021, obliging all authorities to ensure:</p><ul><li>Management and quality of direct public services;</li><li>Management and quality of processes;</li><li>Information governance and quality thereof; and</li><li>Every sub-activity of information governance and quality thereof.</li></ul><p>The regulation aims to establish a common view on how to develop, maintain and provide high-quality public services. With this regulation, Estonia adopted a new approach to developing public services: from now on, public services must be life event-based and, where possible, proactive. Estonia is currently developing a methodology on how to develop and offer such public services.</p><p>The problem that authorities often face is that they do not have a clear view of their services (as defined in the second article of the regulation). For this reason, the regulation obliges authorities providing public services to maintain an up-to-date list of their own direct public services and of support services provided to other authorities, containing at least significant services. Furthermore, the management of the processes behind the services must have a clear owner. </p><p>The regulation also established a network of coordinators:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.mkm.ee/en">Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications</a> is responsible for the management of direct public services, including determining, sharing and exchanging the information necessary for providing such services;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a> is responsible for organising access to and protection of information; and</li><li>The <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/">Estonian Information System Authority</a> is responsible for the implementation of the requirements applying to the architecture of the State Information System and the key components of the State Information System.</li></ul><p>While executing their tasks, the coordinators have the following functions:</p><ul><li>Planning the main directions for development and the activities supporting such development;</li><li>Issuing guidelines and recommendations;</li><li>Monitoring the implementation of planned activities and the application of guidelines;</li><li>Managing communication;</li><li>Cooperating with other coordinators; and</li><li>Engaging other parties, as necessary.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Regulation on the Cross-Border Exchange of Information Regarding Health Services </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/120112018003">Regulation on the Cross-border Exchange of Information regarding Health Services</a> came into force in November 2018, aiming to enable people abroad to have better access to medical care and medicines thanks to the electronic exchange of prescription data between countries. Estonia and Finland became the first two countries in Europe to exchange medicine prescription data. Since January 2019, the first EU patients have been able to use digital prescriptions issued by their home doctor when visiting a pharmacy in another EU country: Finnish patients are now able to go to a pharmacy in Estonia and retrieve medicines prescribed electronically by their doctor in Finland. The initiative applies to all ePrescriptions in Finland and to the Estonian pharmacies that have signed the agreement. The novelty of this initiative is that the ePrescriptions are visible electronically to participating pharmacists in the receiving country via the new eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure, without the patient having to provide a written prescription.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474971"></a>Emerging Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Big data </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud computing</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance computing</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><img src="img/35-749.jpeg" alt="35-749.jpeg" /><p> </p><p>	 Digital Public Administration Governance </p><p>5</p><p>	</p><h1><a id="_Toc37953385"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><p>For more details on Estonia’s responsible bodies for digital policy and interoperability, its main actors, as well as relevant digital initiatives, please visit the <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/digital-public-administration-and-interoperability-national-level-estonia">NIFO collection</a> on Joinup.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474973"></a>National </h2><p class="subtitle">Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications</p><p>The <a href="http://www.mkm.ee/en">Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications</a> holds political responsibility for the development of the State information policy.

More in detail, EEBone is a government-wide backbone network connecting more than 20 000 computers from all government offices across the country, and providing secure access to the internet and the government’s intranet. </p><p>The network was launched in October 1998, and was developed based on ASONet, the backbone network elaborated by the Border Guard Administration, the Customs Board and the Police Board in 1993. The network currently provides approximately 50% of all administrative services to the various associations. The use of the backbone network is financed centrally from the State budget and is free of charge for subscribed clients. Clients only need to pay to access the backbone network and to determine the access connection service themselves.</p><p>RIA is highly involved in running the network, either as a mediator of customised value-added data services, or as a provider of customer services. </p><p class="subtitle">Management System of the State Information System</p><p>The creation and maintenance of government databases is governed by the <a href="http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/X40095K2.htm">Public Information Act </a>of 2007, establishing a <a href="http://www.ria.ee/index.php?id=27314">Management System for the State Information System (RIHA)</a> where all databases and information systems must be registered. The objective of the RIHA is to ensure the interoperability of public sector information systems, and the reuse of technical, organisational and semantic resources, so as to give a clear view of the State registers and the related services. The system of integrated registers also allows for the application of new principles to administrative arrangements, such as citizen-orientation, flexibility, swiftness, and cost and time effectiveness for both citizens and the State.</p><p>The RIHA includes metadata about existing public sector databases, ranging from information on the administrators of the databases to the eServices offered and the technical data concerning the environment/platform. In the same web-based environment, requests to other information systems can be made to launch a new X‑tee‑based service. </p><p class="subtitle">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><p>Estonia uses the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/testa_en">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA)</a> network as the main cross-border infrastructure to communicate digitally among the EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">HOIA </p><p><a href="https://hoia.me/en/">HOIA</a> is a decentralised, free contact tracing mobile application that was developed by the Estonian government and private sector companies. The purpose of the app is to inform the close contacts of those infected with the coronavirus and provide them with initial instructions on how to proceed thereafter. In this way, users can quickly find out about possible close contacts with a COVID-19 infected person, allowing them to take steps to protect their own health and the health of others. The application was developed as open source software and the <a href="https://koodivaramu.eesti.ee/tehik/hoia">source code</a> is available for further reuse. </p><p class="subtitle">X-Road Middleware</p><p>Launched in December 2001, the <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/state-information-system/x-tee.html">X-Road</a> (referred to as <a href="https://www.ria.ee/et/riigi-infosusteem/andmevahetuskiht-x-tee.html">X-tee</a> in English since 2018) is a middle-tier data exchange layer enabling government databases to communicate with each other and serving as main interoperability solution inside Estonia. In particular, the use of X-tee is the mandatory solution for data exchange between public sector information systems. </p><p>Initially developed as an environment facilitating the formulation of queries to different databases in a standardised way, the system allows officials, as well as legal and natural entities, to search data from national databases over the internet, within the limits of their authority, using a unified user interface.</p><p>In addition, the system has been further developed to enable the creation of eServices capable of simultaneously using data stored in different databases. As a result, several extensions have been developed for the X-tee system, such as writing operations in databases, transmitting huge datasets between information systems, performing successive data search operations in different data sheets and providing services via web portals. </p><p>More in detail, the X-tee, as one of the cornerstones of the Estonian State Information System, offers the following services: (i) authentication; (ii) authorisation; (iii) MISP (mini-portal system); (iv) registering of simple queries; (v) queries to various databases and registers; (vi) opportunities to write registers; (vii) sending of large amounts of data over the internet; (viii) secure data interchange, recording of logs and search tracking option; (ix) running of the citizen’s portal and operator’s portal; and (x) central and local monitoring and collection service description in a special database (WSDL mode).</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic ID Card</p><p>Estonia started issuing <a href="http://www.id.ee/?lang=en">national eID cards</a> in January 2002. The card, fulfilling the requirements of Estonia’s Digital Signatures Act, now replaced by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/527102016001/consolide">Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act</a>, is mandatory for all Estonian citizens and residing foreigners over 15 years of age. The eID card is meant to be the primary document for identifying citizens and residents, and is used for all activities – governmental or private. In particular, the <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/">eID card</a> can be used to vote electronically (since 2005), create a business, verify banking transactions and access medical history (since 2010), and can work as a virtual ticket. Furthermore, the eID card is a valid travel document within the EU. Since 1 January 2007, the card issued by the Citizenship and Migration Board (CMB) has become valid for five years (instead of ten years previously). In January 2020, more than 1.3 million people in Estonia (almost 98% of inhabitants) had eID cards. </p><p>In addition to being a physical identification document, the card features advanced electronic functions facilitating secure authentication and providing a legally binding digital signature for public and private online services. An electronic processor chip contains a personal data file, a certificate for authentication, a certificate for digital signature and the associated private keys, protected with PIN codes. The certificates contain only the holder’s name and personal code (national ID code). </p><p class="subtitle">Mobile-ID</p><p>The <a href="http://id.ee/?lang=en&amp;id=36881">mobile-ID</a> is the ID card-based identity verification and digital signature solution for users of mobile phones in Estonia. The mobile phone, based on a standardised SIM application, acts as a secure signing device. Thus, similarly to the eID card, the mobile-ID enables authentication and digital signing of documents, bearing the same legal value. The user’s certificates are maintained on the telecom operator’s SIM card and require the user to enter a PIN code to be used.</p><p class="subtitle">Smart-ID</p><p>As an alternative to the mobile-ID, Estonia has a new private sector-offered solution for secure authentication, called <a href="https://www.smart-id.com/">smart-ID</a>.

The portal allows for digital signatures, verification of the validity of digital signatures, and documents to be forwarded to and received from other users of the portal.</p><p>The Dokobit portal provides a quick and easy way to raise the security of any web service to meet the highest demands, making it possible to carry out authentication based on strong authentication devices from different vendors and providing service providers with the opportunity to enter legal signatures on any created data within their service. That way, the portal provides long-term validity and proof of action in courts across the EU. Finally, the portal enables to gather digital signatures for documents that need to be signed by multiple parties, including entrepreneurs, government officials and individuals.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474994"></a>Public Procurement Registry</p><p>The <a href="https://riigihanked.riik.ee/rhr-web/#/">Public Procurement Registry</a> offers an innovative, free, self-service working environment for buyers (i.e. contracting authorities) to organise and tenderers (i.e. economic operators) to participate in public procurements.

The DHX relies on <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/state-information-system/x-tee.html">X-Road</a> version 6 as transport-level infrastructure. </p><p>The automatic document exchange in the Estonian public sector began in 2006. Due to an irregular internet connection, sending documents from one document management system to another was challenging. For this reason, the State created a central solution, i.e. the Document Exchange Centre, where documents would be temporarily stored in such situations. The Document Exchange Centre was used by all Ministries and agencies in their area of government, county governments, agencies and inspectorates, but also by most of the local governments and educational establishments, and other institutions of the public sector. In 2009, the European Consortium for Electronic State Awards recognised the Document Exchange Centre as a good service and strategic initiative.</p><p>The transition to the new means of document exchange began in 2017, with the Document Exchange Centre closed at the end of 2018 and the new distributed solution for the exchange of documents, the DHX, implemented at the beginning of 2019.
