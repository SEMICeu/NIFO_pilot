The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-265.png" alt="35-265.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Belgium in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-291.jpeg" alt="35-291.jpeg" />	</p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Belgian results in Scoreboard 1 stand for an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles. Belgium performs above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality). Potential areas of improvement relate to the implementation of Principles 3 (Transparency) for which the score of 3 could be further improved to reach the European average. Particularly, the provision of internal visibility and external interfaces for European public service to make administrative procedures available and accessible online (Principle 3 – Recommendation 05) is partial and could be improved to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p><img src="img/35-304.jpeg" alt="35-304.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Belgium’s scores in Scoreboard 2 illustrate an overall good performance of the country with scores of 3 and 4 in all the interoperability layers. Areas of improvement to strengthen the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 concern the interoperability governance, the integrated public service governance and the legal interoperability. More specifically, with regard to the interoperability governance, Belgium has a lower middle performance in the use of structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assessing and selecting standards and specifications (Recommendation 22). Furthermore, concerning the integrated public service and governance, the score of 2 in the implementation of interoperability and coordination over time when operating and delivering integrated public services (Recommendation 25) could be further improved to achieve the EU average. </p><p><img src="img/35-316.jpeg" alt="35-316.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Belgian results in relation to the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance of the country, despite the lack of data on base registries.

The programme set three goals, to be achieved by 2020, namely turning Belgium into one of Europe’s top three digital economies, generating 1 000 new start-ups, and creating 50 000 jobs for the national economy.   </p><p>Digital Belgium outlined the government’s long-term digital vision for the country, which was then translated into specific policy goals. Belgium identified five major priorities that contained three to six priority projects each in the areas of:</p><ol><li>Digital economy;</li><li>Digital infrastructure;</li><li>Digital skills and jobs;</li><li>Digital trust and digital security; and</li><li>Digital government.</li></ol><p>A number of new initiatives were introduced. The Start-up Plan, for example, was a concrete first step to encourage young and beginner entrepreneurs to set up new businesses in innovative sectors via initiatives such as tax shelters for start-ups and fiscal incentives for crowdfunding. Another initiative aimed to roll out eInvoicing for suppliers. Further initiatives are to be launched, such as the National Alliance for Digital Skills and Jobs, a plan for a high-speed internet roll-out, the Digital Health Valley, the Digital Act (a series of legislative proposals enabling, among other things, the use of electronic signatures and digital archiving, in order to replace paper-based solutions), the deployment of the federal cloud, a mobile authentication for eGovernment applications, a multi-directional digital communication platform and an open data strategy.</p><p>On 20 November 2020, the Belgian government announced to the Chamber of Representatives that the drafting of the action plan Digital Belgium 2.0 was ongoing.</p><p class="subtitle">Federal eGovernment Strategy for the Social Sector (2009−present)</p><p>The Federal <a href="https://www.ksz-bcss.fgov.be/en">eGovernment Strategy</a> for the social sector aims to create a single virtual public administration while respecting the privacy of users, as well as the specificities and competences of all government bodies and administrative layers.</p><p>Its main objective is to improve the delivery of public services for citizens and businesses by rendering it faster, more convenient, less constraining and more open. </p><p>The current strategy is outlined as follows: </p><ul><li>Formulation of specific objectives, such as optimal service delivery to citizens, limitation of administrative burden and optimisation of the efficiency and effectiveness of public services;</li><li>Explicit choice to opt for stakeholders’ collaboration in order to create added value for users of eGovernment services;</li><li>Common vision for the use of information in terms of information modelling, mandatory reporting of supposed errors, electronic exchange of information, single collection of information;</li><li>Use of a common vision for information security and protection of privacy;</li><li>Maximum use of common elements for networks, eID, interconnected middleware and related basic services;</li><li>Role of the <a href="https://www.ksz-bcss.fgov.be/en">Crossroads Bank for Social Security</a> (CBSS) as driver for eGovernment development in the social sector; and</li><li>Establishment of a strong partnership among all social security institutions.</li></ul><p>To meet the above-mentioned objectives, the Belgian eGovernment Strategy was based in the past on four main strategic streams:</p><ul><li>1<sup>st </sup>stream: re-engineering and integrating service delivery. </li></ul><p>This first stream focused on user needs, life events and simplification of all administrative procedures. </p><ul><li>2<sup>nd</sup> stream: cooperation among all levels of government to provide integrated services across organisational boundaries and administrative layers. </li></ul><p>The second stream was based on two documents. The first one, the eGovernment Cooperation Agreement, was signed in March 2001 by the federal, regional and local authorities. It laid down a cooperation framework according to which all layers of government committed to using the same standards, the same identification infrastructure and the same eSignature. The second one, the Cooperation Agreement on the Principles of a Seamless eGovernment, signed in April 2006, set the objective of using those information and communication technologies (ICTs) that provide information to all citizens, businesses and public institutions in a user-friendly way.</p><ul><li>3<sup>rd</sup> stream: simplification of administrative procedures for citizens and businesses, which requires an increased exchange and sharing of both data and information among government departments and agencies.</li><li>4<sup>th</sup> stream: back office integration and protection of personal data.</li></ul><p>The department or agency requiring specific data will be considered most frequently as a trusted source by other administrations that may need such data. Hence, the department or agency in question will be responsible for maintaining a personal data repository.</p><p class="subtitle">Communication Campaign on eBox</p><p>In February 2019, a <a href="http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=fr&amp;la=F&amp;cn=2019022708&amp;table_name=loi">new law</a> introduced <a href="https://www.passezaudigital.be/ebox">eBox</a>. eBox is an electronic mailbox that can be used by public actors to send electronic communications to Belgian citizens and registered companies and organisations, including registered mail. During the second half of 2019, the Belgian government developed a communication campaign on social media to promote private partners in the eBox ecosystem. These private partners offer to their clients the possibility to consult government documents with their applications. <a id="_Hlk35856017"></a>During this campaign, the following partners were promoted: Doccle, bpost bank, Trusto. In December 2019, the government released a communication campaign on national television and radio aimed to raise awareness around eBox. In 2020, the Flemish government and local governments also started to use the eBox as their electronic mailbox for sending official government documents.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Wallonia (2015 − present)</p><p>On 6 December 2018, the Walloon government adopted the second version of its <a href="https://www.digitalwallonia.be/fr/publications/2019-2024">Digital Wallonia Strategy</a> for the period 2019−2024. The strategy set the direction to allow the region of Wallonia to seize the socio-economic opportunities of the digital transformation. Just like the first version of 2015, which was based on the contributions of more than 100 actors and organizations, Digital Wallonia 2019−2024 is the result of the work of the Digital Wallonia Champions.</p><p>This strategy is structured around five major goals: </p><ol><li>Digital sector: the goal is to create a strong technological sector by means of a growth programme, which aims to give Wallonia’s digital sector an international dimension; </li><li>Digital economy: the goal is to increase the digital capabilities of companies, which is essential for the development of connected commerce;</li><li>Connected and intelligent territory: the goal is to achieve full high-speed connectivity in Wallonia; </li><li>Open utilities: the goal is to foster open and transparent digital public services; and </li><li>Skills and employment: the goal is developing Wallonia’s citizens’ digital skills.</li></ol><p>More than 20 projects have been implemented as part of the Digital Wallonia Strategy. For example, <a href="https://www.digitalwallonia.be/fr/publications/digitalwallonia4-ai-home">Digital Wallonia 4 AI</a> is now the roadmap for the development of Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, while <a href="https://www.digitalwallonia.be/en/tags/industry-of-the-future-2020#digitalSectors">Digital Wallonia Industry of the Future</a> is the framework for the adoption of the industry 4.0 by factories of the manufacturing sectors, Digital Wallonia Giga Region defines the priorities to offer high-speed fixed and mobile networks to all citizens and companies in Wallonia.</p><p>The strategy marked the Walloon government’s stated ambition to transform Wallonia into a connected and smart territory, where technological companies are recognised as leaders and as the driving force behind the region’s successful industrial transformation. </p><p>In 2019, the new regional government confirmed Digital Wallonia as the digital roadmap for Wallonia. Consequently, the Digital Wallonia Strategy is now fully integrated into the political declaration of the Walloon government.</p><p class="subtitle">Master Plan and Digital Vision of the Ministry of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation</p><p>In May 2016, the Belgian government <a href="http://www.federation-wallonie-bruxelles.be/index.php?id=strategie">signed</a> the first Master Plan of the Ministry of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation (MFWB). This <a href="http://www.federation-wallonie-bruxelles.be/index.php?eID=tx_nawsecuredl&amp;u=0&amp;g=0&amp;hash=73fd7c902140eaefc79e39c16c2a726934577a2f&amp;file=fileadmin/sites/portail/uploads/Illustrations_documents_images/A._A_propos_de_la_Federation/4._Ministere/4.3._Plan_du_management/CA_FWB_version-integrale.pdf">Master Plan</a> for public services represented a first-time effort to set up a global, integrated and consistent roadmap with precise goals, proper governance and adequate funding. </p><p>The digital part of the Master Plan is divided into eight areas, which constitute the pillars of the government’s digital vision. The first pillar aims to work on the user experience, which includes both external users of the public service (e.g., citizens, non-marketers) and internal users. The second pillar concerns data, which represent a relevant component of the entire digital approach. The third pillar is mainly internal and focuses on the digital workplace. The fourth pillar is dedicated to innovation. The fifth pillar concerns digital governance. The sixth pillar targets the digital culture of the organisation, including the acquisition of digital skills and management changes . The seventh pillar is devoted to the necessary resources, including the IT infrastructure. The eighth and most important pillar is the digital platform. It consists of all the IT capabilities of the MFWB. </p><p class="subtitle">Flanders eGovernment Strategy </p><p>As to the Flemish Region, the eGovernment Strategy is under the responsibility of the Minister-President of the Flemish government. It is managed by the Flanders Information Agency, which was created in 2015 by merging the Flemish eGovernment Coordination Cell (CORVE), the <a href="http://www.vlaamseinfolijn.be/"><em>Vlaamse Infolijn</em></a> (the Flemish government call-centre), the <a href="https://www.agiv.be/">Flanders Geographical Information Agency</a> (AGIV) and part of the Department for Administrative Affairs. This agency was responsible for the eGovernment programme <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/praktisch/digitale-werkplek/programma-vlaanderen-radicaal-digitaal"><em>Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaal</em></a> (Radically digital Flanders), an investment programme that ran from 2015 till 2017. The programme substantially increased the digital maturity of the Flemish government digital service provision. It also ensured that the Once-Only data collection principle (known in Flanders as the MAGDA principle) was adopted by the whole Flemish administration. In 2021, a follow-up investment programme, <a href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/uw-overheid/werking-en-structuur/hoe-werkt-de-vlaamse-overheid/informatie-en-communicatie/vlaanderen-radicaal-digitaal-ii"><em>Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaal II</em></a>, has been launched that will again invest EUR 30 million in the creation of a state-of-the-art digital government.</p><p>The main responsibility of the Flanders Information Agency is to determine the strategic aims and priorities for the transformation of the Flemish government into a data-driven government, while taking part in eGovernment projects in an advisory and supportive role. The agency is also in charge of developing eGovernment-related knowledge and skills, coordinating and providing incentives, and creating a generic eGovernment infrastructure to facilitate cooperation among the different entities within the Flemish administration. This generic eGovernment infrastructure consisted of a number of eGovernment building blocks (electronic identification and trust services, electronic documents, eProcurement, authentic sources, etc.) that can be used as shared systems to improve existing (electronic) service delivery and streamline government operations. The agency provides additional funding for cross-departmental eGovernment projects (<em><a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/radicaal-digitaal">Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaal</a> II</em> projects).</p><p>A key policy element in this eGovernment policy is the continued development of authentic sources of information (base registries). These are databases that can be used to obtain complete, correct and up-to-date data on businesses, natural persons, addresses, plots, buildings, maps, etc. A comprehensive system of Flemish authentic data sources and related services is still in the process of being built. </p><p>The Flemish eGovernment strategy 2014−2019 aimed to ‘radically digitally’ transform the Flemish administration, by opting for a digital-first approach in the (increasingly mobile) delivery of new (or existing) Flemish government services. The new Flemish eGovernment strategy 2019−2024 aims to turn the Flemish government into a state-of-the-art digital government, by becoming more data-driven and further adopting the Once-Only principle to proactively deliver digital services to citizens and enterprises.</p><p class="subtitle">eGovernment Strategy of the Brussels-Capital Region</p><p>In May 2014, after the elections, the government <a href="http://www.parlbruparl.irisnet.be/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Accord-de-majorite-REG-FR.pdf">unveiled its policy</a>. Highlights included:</p><ul><li>Brussels Smart City: make Brussels the digital capital;</li><li>progressing as much as possible in terms of online administrative management;</li><li>hotspots at every public transport stop; and</li><li>extension and simplification of Irisbox, the regional one-stop-shop.</li></ul><p>In July 2019, the Brussels government brought forward the <a href="http://www.parlement.brussels/texte-de-la-declaration-de-politique-generale-du-gouvernement-bruxellois/">new policy</a> that, among other digital measures, seeks to address inequalities and poverty by automatically granting derivative rights resulting from the social status of the citizens. Furthermore, the new policy includes an entire section on the ambition of the Brussels Region to become a smart city. The transition towards becoming a smart city has multiple purposes:</p><ul><li>to democratise the access to digital wealth;  </li><li>to improve the quality, the performance and the synergies across public services;</li><li>to reduce the costs and the consumption of available resources; and</li><li>to streamline and improve the interactions between citizens and public administration. </li></ul><p class="subtitle">Strategic Plan of the Steering Organization of the Flemish Information and ICT Policy</p><p>In June 2020, a new <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/digitale-overheid/stuurorgaan-vlaams-informatie-en-ict-beleid/stuurorgaan-vlaams-informatie-en-ict">Strategic Plan</a> of the Steering Organization of the Flemish Information and ICT Policy was adopted by the Flemish government (VR 2020 2606 DOC.0643/1). The plan outlines the priorities with regards to information and ICT policy for the Flemish administration and local authorities for the period 2020−2024. The plan also implements the <em>Vlaanderen Radicaal Digitaa</em>l II Investment Programme which will be used from 2021 on to pursue the objectives of this strategic plan. The management and follow-up of the Strategic Plan is under the responsibility of the Steering Body of the Flemish Information and ICT Policy.

The decree is now being adapted to take into account the new obligations introduced by <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1024">Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information</a>.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474968"></a>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">Law on Public Procurement and Several Public Works Contracts, Public Supply Contracts and Public Service Contracts </p><p>The <a href="https://www.publicprocurement.be/fr/documents/loi-du-17-juin-2016">Law of 17 June 2016 on Public Procurement</a>, published in the Belgian Monitor of 14 July 2016, was last amended by the <a href="https://www.publicprocurement.be/sites/default/files/documents/2019_04_07_loi_wet_fact_elec_3.pdf">Law of 7 April 2019</a>. The changes concerned the inclusion of the definition of eInvoice as well as its essential elements. The new law provided several amendments to the third chapter of the Law of 17 June 2016 concerning Concession Contracts. </p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing Legislation</p><p>In Belgium, the responsible entity for eInvoicing is the Federal Public Service Policy. However, other public services at federal and regional levels may share part of the responsibility. </p><p>There is no overall legislation in place for the country as a whole. In Flanders, B2G eInvoicing is mandatory for regional contracting authorities. At federal level, the Law of 7 April 2019, published in the Belgian Monitor of 16 April 2019 and transposing Directive 2014/55 into national law, requires contracting authorities to receive and process electronic invoices, following the European standard. </p><p>Despite not being mandatory, economic operators are encouraged to submit eInvoices, and central, regional as well as local contracting authorities and entities are encouraged to receive them. </p><p>A <a href="https://einvoice.belgium.be/en">website</a> has been created by the federal Agency for administrative simplification to guide enterprises, private persons and governments through the concept of electronic invoicing and its future applications.</p><p>In 2016, the European Interoperability Framework PEPPOL was implemented in Belgium, with the Directorate-General Digital Transformation of Federal Public Service Policy and Support (FPS P&amp;S) taking up the roll of PEPPOL Authority (PA) for Belgium.  </p><p>The central gateway between private and public sectors (B2G) is the <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/mercurius-en-peppol">Mercurius</a> platform, which acts as an electronic mailroom for invoices sent to all Belgian public entities. This platform is accompanied by a web portal, which allows public service suppliers who have not yet adopted e-Invoicing to send their electronic invoices in the required structured format. For the receipt of incoming invoices, the Flemish Region has decided to collaborate with the federal level and to also use the Mercurius platform.</p><p>At federal level, the <a href="https://einvoice.belgium.be/en/article/convert-structured-invoices-pdf-hermes">Hermes Platform</a> will be made available to companies in Belgium. This free tool will allow them to convert electronic XML invoices to PDF format. This should be seen as an incentive to initiate structured exchanges, while waiting for the IT sector to develop the appropriate reception and processing tools and market them in attractive terms.</p><p class="subtitle">Law on the Acceptance of Bids, Information to Candidates and Tenderers, and Time Limits on Public Procurement and Several Public Works Contracts, Public Supply contracts and Public Service Contracts </p><p>The , related to public procurement, was <a href="https://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/change_lg.pl?language=nl&amp;la=N&amp;table_name=wet&amp;cn=2013061701">amended</a> several times over the last few years. </p><p>It transposed into Belgian law the EU Directives on public procurement, the Directive 2014/25/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and repealing Directive 2004/17/EC, Directive 2014/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on public procurement and repealing Directive 2004/18/EC, and Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the award of concession contracts. They defined the use of electronic tools in public procurement and concession contracts, such as electronic publications of tender opportunities, electronic accessibility of procurement documents, electronic submissions of tenders, acceptance of electronic invoices and electronic means of procurement as having the same legal value as that of traditional means. In addition, they defined new concepts based on public procurement directives, more specifically electronic auctions and the Dynamic Purchasing System. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474969"></a>Domain-Specific Legislation</h2><p class="subtitle">Decree on Primary Care</p><p>The new <a href="http://docs.vlaamsparlement.be/pfile?id=1475222">Decree on Primary Care</a>, which was adopted by the plenary on 3 April 2019, laid down the provisions for the organisation of primary care in Flanders and introduced a digital care and support plan for patients.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474971"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><p><img src="img/35-483.jpeg" alt="A picture containing outdoor, sky, flag

The municipalities (and the Immigration Office for the last category of the population) are the ones responsible for recording the information. Everyone whose data is maintained in the National Registry has a unique identification code, the national registry number. The Once-Only principle is applied to the registry. The consultation of data in the National Registry is subject to authorisation from the relevant sectoral committee established within the Commission for the Protection of Privacy, which is competent to grant access to the National Registry information or communication thereof.

The service has been fully integrated through the <a href="http://www.webdiv.inmotiv.be/nl/home">WebDIV</a> application that allows insurance companies and car dealers to register cars online.

Originally, it served both as institutional site of the Federal government and as eGovernment portal providing a single and multilingual entry point to information and services provided by the Federal government to citizens, businesses and civil servants. </p><p>A new version of the portal was released in May 2008, following a review of the entire system. The objective was to simplify the way citizens and businesses communicated and interacted with the administration. The information, available in Dutch, English, French and German, is displayed in a more user-friendly manner, according to the main life events of both citizens and businesses. Apart from this new user-centric presentation, a powerful search engine allows to perform searches not only within the portal, but also outside of it. A major section of the new portal contains links to all the <a href="http://www.belgium.be/fr/services_en_ligne/">public services available online</a> (eServices). Users looking for a specific eService can refine their search by theme, target group and/or level of government involved. Several of these eServices are secured and thus require authentication (site token or electronic ID card).</p><p>The upgrade process was technically managed by the <a href="http://www.fedict.be/">Federal Government Department for Information and Communication Technology</a> (Fedict). The Fedict has been incorporated into the FPS Policy and Support (BOSA – DG Digital Transformation). On the other hand, the external communication service of the Chancellery of the Prime Minister provided the content, in close collaboration with other federal government departments.</p><p class="subtitle">FedWeb Portal</p><p><a href="http://www.fedweb.belgium.be/fr/">FedWeb</a>, primarily meant for government and administrations’ staff, offers general information about working conditions, news, regulations, publications, online services, etc. The FedWeb newsletter, <a href="http://www.fedweb.belgium.be/fr/newsletter/">FedWeb Light</a>, offers regular information regarding personnel and organisation.</p><p class="subtitle">Single Point of Contact Portal </p><p>The Belgian government launched the first version of the <a href="http://www.business.belgium.be/en">Single Point of Contact Portal</a> for businesses in 2016. It contains practical information that helps users to set up business activities in Belgium. It is continuously updated with more services being added. </p><p class="subtitle">Social Security Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://www.socialsecurity.be/">Social Security Portal</a> offers citizens an extensive, completely updated website structured around three main themes: private life, professional life and health. Every page offers easy navigation to theme-related subjects, external organisations and institutions. The website is the result of a collaboration between all public social security institutions and the Federal Public Service Social Security.</p><p class="subtitle">MyHealth Portal</p><p><a href="https://www.mijngezondheid.belgie.be/#/">MyHealth</a> is a secure online health portal, also called Personal Health Viewer.

The portal maintenance is under the responsibility of the Wallonia Digital Agency, which is member of the Open Data Coordination Committee.</p><p>In March 2021, the portal summed up around 650 datasets which have been consulted by more than 11 000 users. Coordination with the federal level, especially the FPS Policy and Support, is also organised to provide data for the Open Data Common Portal. </p><h3>Subnational Portals</h3><p class="subtitle">Walloon Regional Portal </p><p>The <a href="https://www.wallonie.be/en">Walloon Regional Portal</a> is the main source of information about Wallonia for citizens and businesses. It contains a series of information, ranging from a general overview of Wallonia to more specific step-by-step guidance for citizens and businesses for completing tax declarations. It also has a <a href="https://www.wallonie.be/fr/guide/guide-services/15955">detailed guide</a> to the main institutions of the Walloon region, a RSS feed of the main news in the region, a <a href="https://www.1890.be/">dedicated page for entrepreneurship in Wallonia</a>, and a special personal space that requires a login. </p><p>At the beginning of 2021, the eGovernment portal of the Walloon Public Service was expanded with new features. New services are now available, including online payment, and the offer of electronic procedures has been increased. Work on the UX design based on the user experience has been carried out, with a view to improving accessibility in mobile responsive. The Walloon Portal is connected to eBox, the secure federal mailbox. In July 2021, the platform will also be connected with other Belgian portals such as My MinFin and MySanté. A new roadmap for this portal has been validated for five years (2021−2025) in the framework of the EU funded "Modernisation of the single electronic service" which is part of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/recovery-plan-europe_en">Recovery Plan for Europe</a>. The pace of evolutions will be accelerated and will integrate processes and components from other Walloon public sector platforms.</p><p class="subtitle"><em>Mon Espace </em>Walloon Portal</p><p><a href="https://monespace.wallonie.be/"><em>Mon Espace</em></a><em> </em>(My space)<em> </em>is Wallonia’s personal space for citizens and businesses to interact with their public administrations.

Built around its users’ life events to best meet their needs, this portal provides citizens and businesses easy access to information and regional public services in Dutch. The portal is constantly being updated and can be seen as a reference point for all Flemish government organisations that want to make their digital services simpler, more recognisable and optimally accessible for their customers and for citizens. An important new addition to this portal is <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/ontdek-mijn-burgerprofiel"><em>Mijn Burgerprofiel</em></a> (My citizen profile), a user-friendly and scalable plug-and-play website feature that allows for data consultation in a safe and reliable manner, allowing citizens to see what the government knows about them and what the government has done and is doing for them. <em>Mijn Burgerprofiel </em>is accessible both through the portal and through local governments websites, thus achieving the no-wrong-door goal of integrated government service delivery.</p><p class="subtitle">Brussels Regional Be Home Portal </p><p>The <a href="https://be.brussels/">eGovernment Portal Be Home </a>(<em>Chez Vous</em>) of the Brussels-Capital Region provides a range of information in Dutch, English, French, German and Spanish, as well as regional online services arranged by theme; it is available in English, Dutch and French.</p><p>Many on-line forms and procedures can be processed electronically via the <a href="https://irisbox.irisnet.be/">Irisbox</a> one-stop-shop. On 17 November 2011, the Brussels government decided that all forms should be available through that platform.</p><p class="subtitle">Accueil des Enfants Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.accueildesenfants.be/">Portal <em>Accueil des Enfants</em> </a>was launched by Wallonia within the broader context of social and professional mobility and the equal opportunities' framework, as well as the support of childcare and family policies. It is supported by more than 25 regional communities and offers valuable information on day-care centres, nurseries, youth centres, homework aid schools, youth camps, youth associations, traineeships, cultural and sport centres and other forms of childcare within the borders of the province.</p><p class="subtitle">Business Support Portal for the Walloon Region </p><p>The Business Support Portal, managed by the <a href="http://as-e.be/">Enterprise and Innovation Agency</a> (ex-ASE - Economic Stimulation Agency), offers to businesses and entrepreneurs all kinds of information about management, financing, development, and support by public authorities. </p><p class="subtitle">Fédération Wallonie – Bruxelles </p><p>The <a href="http://www.federation-wallonie-bruxelles.be/">new portal</a> of the French Community was launched in September 2014 and provides information both to business and citizens related to the competences within the scope of the WBF. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.odwb.be/">Open Data Wallonie-Bruxelles (ODWB) Portal</a> is an open data portal shared by the Walloon Region and the Wallonia-Brussels Federation. It is part of a proactive approach to data governance, aimed at facilitating access to information managed or generated by their public service agencies, as a basis for transparent public action. It represents both a tool for increased citizen participation and an incentive to create innovative services.</p><p>The data gathered within this portal are aggregated at the level of the <a href="https://digiplace.sharepoint.com/sites/WE-EUROPEANCOMMISSION-ABCIVSC263NIFO/Shared Documents/D04.01 Digital Government factsheets and infographics/Country factsheets 2020/Belgium/data.gov.be">federal portal </a>(as is the case for the Flemish and Brussels portals), which is itself taken up at <a href="http://data.europa.eu/">European level</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">German-Speaking Community of Belgians Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.dglive.be/">eGovernment Portal</a> of the German-speaking Community provides a range of information both to businesses and citizens concerning the community’s administrative procedures and services, as well as administrative forms to download.</p><p class="subtitle">Flemish Portal for Enterprises </p><p>The new <a href="https://www.vlaanderenonderneemt.be/">Flemish Portal for Enterprises and Entrepreneurs</a> uses the federal <a href="file:///C:/Users/arentsha/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/TKVWTY72/, https:/economie.fgov.be/en/themes/enterprises/crossroads-bank-enterprises">Cross-Roads Bank for Enterprises</a> as a base registry.

Belnet connectivity includes access to the pan-European research network <a href="http://archive.dante.net/Backbones/GEANT/Pages/GEANT.aspx">Géant</a> and the American <a href="http://www.internet2.edu/">Internet2</a>.</p><p>Belnet also operates a central infrastructure for exchanging internet traffic for internet service and content providers and large private companies, called the Belgian National Internet Exchange or BNIX. Other activities include the Federal Metropolitan Area Network (<a href="http://www.fedict.belgium.be/de/Images/FEDMAN-CASE_tcm463-119515.pdf">FedMAN</a>), the supercomputing network GRID, and the Belgian National Computer Emergency Response Team.</p><p class="subtitle">FedMAN</p><p><a href="http://www.fedict.belgium.be/en/infrastructure/network_access/fedman">FedMAN</a>, launched by the <a href="http://www.fedict.be/">Federal Department for ICT (Fedict, currently known as FPS BOSA DG DT)</a> in September 2002, is the Federal Metropolitan Area Network which connects the administrations of 15 federal ministries and government service buildings in Brussels. FedMAN offers to 80 000 federal civil servants a shared high-speed network and a number of related services supporting the delivery of eGovernment, including access to the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/5014/5584.html">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA)</a> network of the European Union. The first level of FedMAN is a central platform, while the second level enables the creation of virtual networks for each federal administration. Federal departments have the right to use the central platform to create their own security environments.</p><p>An upgraded version of FedMAN, FedMAN II, whose capacities are ten times superior to the original version, has been operational since March 2006. It is intended to allow for the launch of new services, such as the Voice over IP and for infrastructure-sharing between different federal departments.</p><p class="subtitle">Federal Service Bus</p><p>The <a href="http://registry.fsb.pr.belgium.be/web/service-catalog/partner/homepage">Federal Service Bus (FBS)</a>, which started in 2006, is service-oriented and allows for a simplified connection among the various applications and the federal administration’s IT data files. At the same time, FSB is set to ensure the follow-up of specific processes. Access should also be open to private companies, by means of an authorisation.</p><p>Together with the newly available Database Centre of Fedict, the FSB is intended to contribute to the achievement of the Connected Government architecture of Fedict. Fedict, in turn, foresees a sound basic structure for eGovernment as users can access all the web services of the various government departments via a single contact point. </p><p class="subtitle">IRISnet</p><p><a href="http://www.irisnet.eu/en?set_language=en">IRISnet</a> is the name of the Brussels-Capital Region broadband network, designed to simplify telecommunications among regional public bodies. It is built upon fibre optic cables and uses the latest technologies to support data, voice and video streaming flows. The version 2.0 of the IRISnet network was approved by the Belgian government and became operational in 2012.</p><p class="subtitle">Urbizone</p><p>Complementary to IRISnet and designed to close the digital divide, a Wi-Fi network called <a href="http://www.urbizone.be/">Urbizone</a> has been deployed on several Brussels university campuses, in numerous town halls, in the meeting rooms of a series of public administrations and in six ministerial cabinets. An access point is available for refugees who are lining up in front of the administrations in charge of welcoming them.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Federal Service Bus</p><p>The <a href="https://dtservices.bosa.be/fr/faq/01-generalites-le-federal-service-bus-fsb-cest-quoi">Federal Service Bus (FSB)</a> aims to be the gateway to the main (authentic) data sources of the federal government. More specifically, the service puts a platform at the disposal of the federal administrations, bodies, and institutions performing a task of general interest, to allow for the consultation or standardised exchange of data, from application to application, via the Internet. The platform makes web services available in a harmonised and secure manner that offer seamless access to (authentic) data sources.</p><p class="subtitle">Kruispuntbank Vlaanderen</p><p><a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/informatie-vlaanderen/ontdek-onze-producten-en-diensten/kruispuntbank-vlaanderen"><em>Kruispuntbank Vlaanderen</em></a> (Flanders Crossroad Bank) is the new Flemish Data Exchange Platform. The new platform fulfils three basic functions: it makes data easily accessible in the form that best suits everyone's needs (to this aim, standardised APIs are used); it ensures the quality of the data (by using standards elaborated within OSLO or INSPIRE); it ensures the integrity of the data, meaning that no third party has the possibility to change the data during transport and, in case of personal data, it supports its partners in the confidential and secure processing of the data throughout the entire process. The platform results from the merger of the existing MAGDA and GDI platforms.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Belgian eID card</p><p>The <a href="http://eid.belgium.be/">Belgian eID</a> card contains all the information included on the traditional identity card and serves as an identification and travel document. It is a smart card containing two certificates: one for the authentication and another one for generating digital signatures. The Belgian eID thus gives access to restricted online services making Internet use safer by providing an online means of identification and enables the electronic submission of official documents as well as other related services. The national registry number, that is the unique identification number for Belgian citizens, appears on the eID card and its microchip. It is used as unique identifier in the certificate of the eID card.</p><p>It is to be noted that almost all of the electronic signature applications in the Belgian eGovernment sector make use of the Belgian eID card. On the federal <a href="https://my.belgium.be/nl">eGovernment Portal</a>, multiple levels of security exist, depending on the type of eService delivered: (1) no password required; (2) password required; (3) password and token required; (4) eID only; (5) unconnected eID; and (6) mobile authorisation (time based one-time password (TOTP). The eID card can only be issued for natural persons.</p><p>On 16 March 2009, Belgium introduced an electronic ID card for the under-12s (Kids-ID), which, in addition to the classic ID functions, can provide access to children-only Internet chat rooms and to a range of emergency phone numbers, should the child be in danger. Furthermore, since July 2008, foreign nationals living in Belgium are entitled to replace their old paper identity card with versatile and smart electronic identity cards. These cards come in two varieties: for EU and non-EU citizens.</p><p>The federal administration approves wireless alternatives to the wired eID reader. A first solution was approved in 2015 and integrated in the Federal Authentication Service (FAS). eGovernment applications that make use of the FAS can benefit from the new wireless authentication service. This is already the case for the Irisbox one-stop-shop of the Brussels Region.</p><p class="subtitle">Federal Signing Box</p><p>The <a href="https://sign.belgium.be/">Federal Signing Box application</a> allows users to sign files electronically and verify signed files by means of their eID.</p><p class="subtitle">eSignBox</p><p>The <a href="https://signature.wallonie.be/eSign/">eSignBox tool</a>, created by the Walloon public authorities, allows for easy digital signing of electronic documents and files. In practice, users can sign a file but also check an existing signed file and its certificate.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Signature Platform of Flanders</p><p>The <a href="https://www.vlaanderen.be/nl">Digital Signature Platform of Flanders</a> was launched on 20 September 2010 by the Flemish eGovernment and ICT-Management Unit (<em>Entiteit eGovernment en ICT-Beheer</em> (e-IB). Since then, all public authorities of the regional government of Flanders have been able to digitally sign documents in a legal way via the platform. More specifically, the platform converts the files it receives into ready-to-sign PDF documents which can be distributed to and signed by the various parties using their Belgian electronic identity cards (eID). Citizens, businesses and the external partners of the Flemish government benefit from many advantages such as legal validity, user friendliness, the possibility of signing by multiple parties, support for different document formats, open standards and a greener ICT.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Certificates</p><p>The commercial certification authorities' <a href="http://www.belgianchambers.be/en/">certificates</a> can be used in a number of eGovernment applications, as an alternative to eID card signatures. Since 2007, the federal government has recognised three private certification authorities complying with the required standards regarding qualified certificates, as defined in the Belgian eSignatures Act. Their certificates were used for certain eGovernment applications, in particular tax and social security eServices. Like the eID, these digital certificates contained certain identity data, the public key connected with the certificate holder, the public key usage, the validity and the category of the certificate. They were issued to natural persons and legal entities. </p><p class="subtitle">Biometric Passports</p><p>In November 2004, Belgium scored a world first by becoming the first country to start issuing <a href="https://diplomatie.belgium.be/en/services/services_abroad/belgian_passport/applying_passport">electronic passports</a> complying with the recommendations of the <a href="http://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)</a>.

The eProcurement platform can be used by federal, regional as well as local public entities for public procurement purposes. Companies can access the platform for new public contracts, for submitting their offers and in order to follow the status of the process. </p><p class="subtitle">eNotification Platform</p><p>Launched in 2002 as the instrument used by the federal government for the electronic publication of calls for tender, the <a href="https://enot.publicprocurement.be/home.do">platform</a> presents all federal and non-federal entities’ calls for tender. The platform assists public bodies in drafting their calls for tender and submitting them electronically to the official publication organisations, enabling them to notify invitations to tender, contract awards, as well as other documents such as minutes of clarification meetings or technical notes. On the other hand, it allows businesses to browse and search tender opportunities and related documentation. This platform communicates with the eTendering platform in order to communicate all notices published to everyone.</p><p class="subtitle">eTendering Platform</p><p><a href="https://eten.publicprocurement.be/etendering/home.do">eTendering</a> is an open, secure, interoperable and re-configurable eProcurement platform based on open European standards and EC directives. Via the platform, contracting authorities and economic operators can perform some of their daily eProcurement activities.</p><p class="subtitle">eCatalogue Platform</p><p>The <a href="https://ecat.publicprocurement.be/ecat/home.action">eCatalogue Platform</a> offers a collaborative environment for businesses to upload their catalogues and manage dossiers while enabling the reception of electronic orders and modification of the status of the orders.</p><p class="subtitle">Development of an eOrdering Portal in OpenPEPPOL in the Flemish Region</p><p><a href="https://peppol.eu/about-openpeppol/what-is-openpeppol/">OpenPEPPOL</a> is a non-profit international association under Belgian law consisting of public and private sector members. The purpose of OpenPEPPOL is to enable European businesses to easily deal with any European public sector buyers electronically in their procurement process. It made it possible for economic operators to receive orders electronically from any public sector awarding entity in Europe. The region of Flanders makes use of the PEPPOL-model for <a href="https://overheid.vlaanderen.be/e-ordering">eOrdering and eCatalogues</a>. </p><p class="subtitle">Regional eTendering Portal of the Walloon Region and the French Community </p><p>Some regional, community and local authorities have developed their own eTendering portals. For instance, the Walloon Region and the French Community share the same portal.</p><p class="subtitle">eInvoice</p><p>In 2013, the Council of Ministers launched a pilot project for inbound e-invoicing to the public authorities. This pilot project gave rise to several positive developments including the launch of the Mercurius inter-federal platform.</p><p>In 2019, <a href="https://einvoice.belgium.be/en">eInvoice</a> was launched by BOSA to guide users through the concept of electronic invoicing, its future applications and implications for Belgium. The website uses the PEPPOL model of eInvoicing to support both B2G and the B2B eInvoicing. At federal level, BOSA became a <a href="https://peppol.eu/who-is-who/peppol-authorities/">PEPPOL Authority</a>.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474997"></a>Databases/Authentic Sources System</p><p>Belgian eGovernment strategies rest on an authentic-source system by which federal public departments gather and manage their own databases with information provided by citizens, businesses and civil servants. These databases, known as authentic sources, can be consulted by other federal services in need of this type of information. This way, citizens and businesses will be asked to convey data only once. Among the operational authentic sources there are:</p><ul><li>The <a href="http://www.ibz.rrn.fgov.be/index.php?id=34&amp;L=0">National Registr</a>y: managed by the Interior Department, the National Registry gathers basic data relating to all persons holding the Belgian nationality; and</li><li>The <a href="http://economie.fgov.be/fr/entreprises/BCE/index.jsp">Crossroads Bank for Enterprises</a>: managed by the Economy Department, CBE is an integrated business registry that contains all authentic sources of all Belgian enterprises such as company name, company number, postal and email address, legal form, activities performed within the company, professional skills of the company staff etc. </li></ul><p>Similar infrastructure elements are implemented at regional level. For instance, in February 2006, the Flemish eGovernment Coordination Cell (CORVE) launched <a href="http://www.corve.be/producten/magda-diensten/ondernemingsgegevens/scherm/index.php">VKBO-GO</a>, the online application of the Flemish Crossroads Bank for Enterprises.</p><p>In Wallonia and in the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, <a href="http://www.ksz-bcss.fgov.be/fr/bcss/page/content/websites/belgium/security/security_05.html">a Crossroad Bank for Data Exchange</a> (<em>BCED - Banque Carrefour d'échange de données</em>) was launched in May 2013.</p><p>It is an exchange platform facilitating the sharing of data among administrations of Wallonia and WBF. The Bank acts as an independent entity and offers services that increase the reliability of electronic data exchange and data recording.  BCED follows rules regarding the protection of privacy and computer security in general. The staff are composed of members of eWBS, Etnic and DTIC. </p><p>BCED's mission is to create authentic sources in Wallonia and in the Wallonia Brussels Federation. The following will soon be designed as authentic sources: a centralized inventory of Wallonia's addresses and streets (ICAR); SEVESO companies in Wallonia; and signage for students (SIEL) in compulsory education.</p><p>The Brussels Region has also rolled out a similar exchange platform called <a href="https://bric.brussels/en/our-solutions/infrastructure-solutions/fidus?set_language=en">Fidus</a>.

In the last 15 years, the MAGDA Platform has continued to grow: in 2020, the number of transactions via the MAGDA web services rose to 288 million, a 40% increase compared to the previous year.</p><p>The MAGDA Platform ensures that data from authentic sources can be extracted from databases in a secure manner. Thanks to the platform, citizens and businesses do not have to submit their data to the government more than once. </p><p>MAGDA is connected with base registries at federal level through the relevant service integrators. When receiving the data in various formats, it transforms it to a single MAGDA format, thus ensuring that all users have to deal with a single data format only. It also handles data privacy issues making this process transparent for users. </p><p>MAGDA contains non-geographic data, while the Geographic Digital Infrastructure (GDI) allows for access to geospatial data. The MAGDA Platform together with the GDI are now part of the new Flemish data-exchange platform, the <em>Kruispuntbank Vlaanderen</em>.</p><p class="subtitle">beConnected</p><a id="voorwie"></a><p><a href="https://fedweb.belgium.be/nl/over_de_organisatie/kennismanagement/beconnected">beConnected</a> is an electronic platform that allows all staff members of federal organisations and social security actors to collaborate and manage documents remotely. beConnected enables its users to:</p><ul><li>Share and edit documents;</li><li>Manage versions;</li><li>Send messages and links; and</li><li>Give access to whomever they want, with the rights they want.</li></ul><p>Additionally, beConnected is ideal for supporting networks and projects with external parties: this allows users to collaborate remotely and exchange information with other federal organisations and social security institutions, but also with people who do not work for the federal government.</p><p>Since 2010, beConnected has replaced eCommunities, a groupware application that had been made accessible to civil servants since April 2003 through the<a href="http://www.belgium.be/"> eGovernment portal. </a>It aimed to enable communication, cooperation, knowledge management and sharing within cross-departmental networks of expertise.

In order to avoid typing the same information several times (or typing any information at all), IWF automatically displays auto-filling suggestions. Once the user is logged in, the system shows the information in compliance with the content of the National Registry. </p><p>In addition, upon users’ authorisation, the tool is able to retrieve new information and categorise it by type of data. The application follows the snowball effect - each time citizens or business owners allow storage of new information, the potential for reuse is ramped up and the amount of time to fill the next form is exponentially reduced. As a secondary effect, the quality and consistency of the information supplied is only expected to improve.</p><p>This tool can have a significant impact in terms of time saved, considering the potential number of users and the number of online forms that can use this application.</p><h2>Cross-border Platforms</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Association to the European Business Registry</p><p>Belgium is a member of the <a href="http://www.ebr.org/index.php/member-countries/european-interactive-map/belgium/">European Business Registr</a>y, which is a network of national business registries. </p><p class="subtitle">EUCARIS</p><p>Belgium has been a member of the <a href="https://www.eucaris.net/countries/belgium/">European Car and Driving Licence Information System (EUCARIS)</a> since 1994, which it uses to provide vehicular information.
