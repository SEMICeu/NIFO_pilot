The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-198.png" alt="35-198.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Ireland in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-236.x-emf" alt="35-236.x-emf" />	</p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Ireland’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and 9 (Multilingualism). Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 4 (Reusability), 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility), and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) whose results show an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. For instance, by working on Recommendation 6, which concerns the reuse, share, and cooperation in the development of joint solutions when implementing European public services, the overall score for Principle 4 would be improved.</p><p><img src="img/35-247.x-emf" alt="35-247.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Irish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an excellent performance, with a score of 4 in all layers. In order to furher improve its performance, the country should focus on ensuring holistic governance of interoperability activities across administrative levels and sectors (Interoperability governance – Recommentation 20).</p><p><img src="img/35-260.x-emf" alt="35-260.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Ireland’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an overall good performance, achieving a higher score than the EU average concertning external information sources and services. However, some areas of improvement have also been identified. Particularly, recommendations related to the conceptual model could be improved by deciding on a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components and puting in place and maintaining the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining European public services (Conceptual Model – Recommendation 35). In addition, Ireland should use trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (Secuity and Privacy – Recommendation 47) in order to achive an higher score in this component. </p><p>Additional information on Ireland’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity:</strong> indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services:</strong> indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers:</strong> indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The act comes in the wake of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018, with the aim to clarify and strengthen the data-sharing rights and obligations of public bodies. The act paves the way for more efficient and cost-effective service delivery by public bodies by providing a clear legal basis for the sharing of personal data in certain circumstances. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden associated with the need for individuals to provide their personal data to numerous public bodies. The act allows for the sharing of personal data between public bodies where the sharing is for the performance of a function of either of the public bodies. In addition, the act provides for the establishment of a Personal Data Access Portal that would allow individuals to view their personal data as well as information in relation to any data breaches affecting their personal data and the data-sharing agreements under which their personal data is processed. Besides, the act allows the Minister to designate base registries for use by public bodies so that they can access personal data without having to collect it directly from service users.

The act prescribes the provisions for the various types of companies in existence as well as the allowed organisational frameworks within which they can function.

This is mostly due to historical reasons, as separate registries were kept for each of these different life events. For example, ‘Part 3 Registration of Births and Stillbirths’ states: “In this Part, ‘the register’ means, as the context requires, the register of births or the register of stillbirths and cognate words shall be construed accordingly”.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474969"></a>Domain-specific legislation</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Commerce Act </p><p>The <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0027/index.html">Electronic Commerce Act</a> became law on 20 September 2000, implementing the EU Directive on a Community framework for electronic signatures <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31999L0093:EN:HTML">(1999/93/EC)</a> and, in part, the EU Directive on electronic commerce <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML">(2000/31/EC)</a>. </p><p>The act provides (with some exceptions) for the legal recognition of electronic signatures, electronic writing and electronic contracts.

This network is a privately managed Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS), wide area multi-carrier, national network (WAN) that supports multiple Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for public sector bodies. Key tenets of the GN are high speed, high capacity and resilient connections. The enhanced resilience that is built into GN through the use of MPLS is designed to ensure, in so far as is possible, that public sector bodies have several secure resilient paths both within and external to their own agency traffic be that voice, video or data. GN offers a number of potential cost and operational benefits: inter-agency collaboration and delivery of joined-up government services; access for all agencies to network capability and products/technology (regardless of size); execution of a number of standard day-to-day infrastructure services allowing agencies to focus on their core programmes and services; improvement of security for government information systems; internet access for agencies; and commercial advantages of an aggregated procurement approach, resulting in reduced costs and high quality services. </p><p>In 2018, through a coordinated and innovative nationwide approach to the delivery of connectivity, economies of scale have been achieved with standardised services to agencies in cities, towns and more remote locations where previously only limited services existed. The GN also supports centralised voice services and centralised corporate and guest Wi-Fi services, facilitating public service bodies to deploy secure wireless networks in multiple locations with minimum investment in infrastructure. This network also hosts the Gateways to the European Network of Administrations sTESTA. </p><p>Under the revised National Development Plan 2021-2030, a shared <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/68cc8-sustainability-and-climate-action-at-the-heart-of-key-ndp-funded-opw-projects/">Government Data Centre</a> is being built to aid in the upgrading of the Government’s digital infrastructure and is anticipated to be completed by 2025. </p><p>The Government Networks Programme Board is currently undertaking a project to ensure that public administrations maximise the benefit from 5G technologies. This project consists in building a low latency platform with a high speed backbone using edge compute nodes to enable a faster response. This Platform will interconnect with the local access technologies of the carriers, including Stand-alone 5G as it becomes available nationwide, and will connect to Government and Commercial Datacentres as well as Cloud providers. This will allow for processing of data at the appropriate location, be that at an edge compute node, a regional compute node, or in the Cloud.</p><p>A variety of public services shall be subsequently developed, tested and deployed using the platform, notably for Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) and “test before invest” for SMEs and start-ups. The analysis and processing of information at the appropriate point will enable faster, more informed responses to incidents than human-reliant monitoring could provide. The Public Sectors and staff that will benefit from the proposal are public health, veterinary/agriculture inspectors, social workers, policing and local authorities etc. as the platform enables the provision of country-wide edge compute, enabling effective and responsive public services.</p><p class="subtitle">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><p>Ireland uses the Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) network as the main cross border infrastructure to communicate digitally among the EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">COVID Tracker Ireland</p><p><a href="https://covidtracker.gov.ie/">COVID Tracker Ireland</a> is a free contact-tracing mobile application that was developed by the Irish government, the Health Service Executive (HSE), and NearForm using open source software.

The platform is used by the public service including the OGP and its Central Purchasing Body (CPB) partners in the health, defence, education and local government sectors; central government Departments and agencies; local government and health sector organisations; and the wider public sector comprising semi-state organizations, both commercial and non-commercial, and voluntary and community groups that are funded by EU or state bodies. </p><p>eTenders currently has approximately 155 600 registered entities – 5 900 Contracting Authorities and 149 700 Economic Operators - and it is a key interface between the public, businesses and the government for public procurement. The OGP sets the policy on site content and functionality. However, day-to-day site management and maintenance, as well as its development, have been outsourced to a private platform service provider company.</p><p>eTenders displays, on a daily basis, all Irish public sector procurement opportunities currently being advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), as well as other lower-value contracts uploaded to the site from awarding authorities. At any given time, the portal will contain all open opportunities in the form of Tender Notices, Prior Indicative Notices (PIN) and Contract Award Notices (CAN). eTenders also provides associated tender documents (where available) which can be downloaded from the site.</p><p>eTenders has the functionality to allow Awarding Authorities to publish notices on the site which are then sent to the OJEU automatically. Other functionalities include: facility for conducting online clarifications via Q&amp;A; online submission of tenders; user and notice management facilities to awarding authorities; and email alerts and response management facilities to suppliers. Comprehensive notice search and help functions are also available. </p><p>eTenders is central to the reform and ongoing digital transformation of public procurement. The service is free of charge to contracting authorities or suppliers. The eTenders site is also freely available for use by the public to view tender notices published by public Contracting Authorities.</p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing Ireland Programme</p><p>The <a href="https://ogp.gov.ie/einvoicing/">eInvoicing Ireland Programme</a> was established in the OGP. In 2019, the OGP, through the eInvoicing Ireland Programme and in collaboration with public sector partners, established a National Framework for the Procurement of eInvoicing Systems and Services by Public Bodies. The Framework offers compliant eInvoicing services and solutions for shared services and coordinating facilities as well as individual public bodies, to receive and process eInvoices in accordance with the European Standard and the national approach for the implementation of the directive. The services and solutions range from online portals that facilitate basic compliance to more integrated straight-through-processing options.</p><p>Since 18 April 2019, central government contracting authorities and entities are required to receive and process eInvoices that comply with the European Standard on eInvoicing in public procurement. Since 18 April 2020, all contracting authorities and entities are required to receive and process eInvoices that comply with the European Standard on eInvoicing in public procurement.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.  <a id="_Toc1474996"></a></p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle">Build to Share Applications</p><p>Build to Share Applications are built and maintained by the <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/6ee40f-office-of-the-government-chief-information-officer-ogcio/">OGCIO</a>, which delivers a suite of corporate support applications common across Departments. The central development of a common applications suite for use by all Departments was identified in the <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/65eb49-public-service-ict-strategy/">Public Service ICT Strategy</a> as an opportunity to drive efficiencies and savings.
