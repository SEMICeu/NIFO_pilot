The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-780.png" alt="35-780.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Croatia in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-781.jpeg" alt="35-781.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Croatia’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall medium to good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring at the European average for most of the Principles. Areas of improvement are concentrated in the Principles 5 (Technological neutrality and data portability), 6 (User-centricity) and 10 (Administrative simplification), for which the scores of 2 and 3 show a medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the country should not impose any technological solutions on citizens, businesses and other administrations that are technology-specific or disproportionate to their real needs (Principle 5 – Recommendation 08). In addition, Croatian public administrations should foster the use of multiple channels to provide public services, so as to ensure that users can select the channel that best suits their needs (Principle 6 – Recommendation 10) and ask users of European public services once-only and relevant-only information (Principle 6 – Recommendation 13). Lastly, Croatia should simplify its processes and use digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users’ requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens (Principle 10 – Recommendation 17).</p><p><img src="img/35-783.jpeg" alt="35-783.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Croatian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance with mostly scores of 4. The only potential area of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 is concentrated on interoperability governance, where Croatia scored 3. The lower score is due to the lower score for Recommendation 24, whereby Croatia should improve its participation in standardisation work relevant to citizens’ or businesses’ needs, to ensure that their requirements are met. </p><p><img src="img/35-785.jpeg" alt="35-785.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Croatia’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a medium performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with internal and external information sources and services and open data. However, to align with the European average, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to the conceptual model itself, to base registries as well as in the area of security and privacy. Precisely, the lack of a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components and putting in place the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining public services (Conceptual Model - Recommendation 35) hinders the overall Croatian score on the conceptual model. In addition, Croatia could improve the implementation of the recommendations related to Security and Privacy, by identifying measures for the provision of each public service according to risk management plans (Recommendation 46) and to foster the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services (Recommendation 47).</p><p>Additional information on Croatia’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The Implementation Programme is a short-term act of strategic planning related to the multi-annual budget prepared by the Ministry of Justice and Administration within 120 days of the formation of the new government. The programme refers to the mandate period, and describes priority measures and activities for implementing the goals set in the 2020 programme of the government of the Republic of Croatia, national development plans and other relevant acts of strategic planning of national importance. </p><p>During this mandate of the government of the Republic of Croatia, the Ministry of Justice and Administration continues with activities aimed at further strengthening the efficiency of the judiciary and public administration, and further preventing corruption, so that the judiciary and public administration meet the needs of citizens and economic operators.

As part of the Programme, efforts were made to achieve a functional and accessible public administration and further digitisation. Moreover, for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of institutions, measures included the simplification of rules and the acceleration of the work of the administration through the digitisation of all processes with a view to expanding eServices to citizens and businesses, interconnecting all State administration bodies and establishing a uniform manner of communication between citizens and State administration bodies. </p><p>One of the programme’s objectives relating to public administration was the accomplishment of the digitisation of public services. The plan involved establishing a Central Government Information System, the optimisation of resources, the centralised management of all information systems and services in one place, and the introduction and use of electronic identification (eID) for all citizens. </p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk66194043"></a>National Plan for Recovery and Resilience</p><p>The goals of the digital transition of the Croatian society and economy defined in the National Plan for Recovery and Resilience (NPRR) are planned to be achieved through the implementation of reforms and related investments. The proposed reforms are also based on the three main objectives of the EU's Digital Future Strategy (Shaping Europe's Digital Future), which should ensure that Europe seizes the opportunity of the digital transition and gives its citizens, businesses and governments control over digital transformation. The three main objectives are (i) technologies in the interest of citizens; (ii) a fair digital economy that encourages competition; and (iii) an open, democratic and sustainable society. The proposed reform called Digital Croatia Strategy and the Strengthening of Inter-Institutional Cooperation and Coordination for a Successful Digital Transition of Society and Economy is aimed at overcoming the existing challenges in monitoring and coordinating the digitisation process. These challenges are also caused by the lack of strategic guidelines for ensuring the systematic digital transformation of the society and economy. Therefore, a strategic framework needs to be defined for the digitisation of Croatia, which should also be harmonized with the EU Digital Future Strategy and in particular with the goal of an open, democratic and sustainable society.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">National Plan for Recovery and Resilience</p><p>The proposed reform called Improving the Interoperability of Information Systems will focus on the further development of public services and national information infrastructure, and on the establishment of a central interoperability system. This initiative will also contribute to the goal of the European Data Strategy of creating a single data market and to the smooth flow of data across various sectors at the EU, but also at the Croatian, level, for the benefit of companies, researchers and public administration. </p><p>The goal is to establish the interoperability of public registers and information systems, and implement a central data warehouse and a platform for the exchange of Internet of Things (IoT) data. The introduction of a centralised IoT integration platform would enable the central collection and sharing of large amounts of data from various sensors, and make all necessary tools available to the public and private sectors. The platform would be able to host applications whose function is to process and share available data in real time.</p><p class="subtitle">National Development Strategy 2030</p><p>In the National Development Strategy 2030, under the strategic goal ‘Digital Transition of Society and Economy’, investments in the State information infrastructure will continue in order to facilitate the development of new business models based on digital technologies by introducing interoperable solutions. The proposed reform called Improving the Interoperability of Information Systems, under the NPRR, will focus on the establishment of a central interoperability system, and the interoperability of public registers and information systems as well as the implementation of a central data warehouse and a platform for the exchange of IoT data.</p><p class="subtitle">Shared Services Centre</p><p>Under the project aimed at the establishment of a <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/uspostava-centra-dijeljenih-usluga/1596">Shared Services Centre</a>, a central interoperability platform was introduced. Currently, about ten registers are integrated in the Government Service Bus (GSB) with a view to developing eServices. The GSB is the technical solution that was established in the Shared Services Centre, that represents the component of the Central Interoperability System. The GSB provides the functionality of securely receiving, forwarding, recording, encrypting and validating messages and documents between individual public sector bodies. </p><p>The available eServices include the eEnrolment and eRenovation services. The eEnrolment service is available in educational institutions. The process of integrating public registers in the GSB started precisely to develop a complex eService of electronic registration and enrolment in educational institutions. This project envisages the integration of eight registers (veterans' register, birth register, residence register, etc.) through the GSB. The process includes the publication of the application service (application programming interface or API) on the GSB and the use of this application service in order to retrieve data from public registers.</p><p>The second eService that is important in this context is eRenovation, i.e. a digital system that enables the submission of requests for renewal attaching all necessary documentation, monitors the implementation of the renewal procedure, displays renewal data on the Geoportal and provides reports according to various criteria. The following principles have been applied in the development of the system: (i) minimize the amount of data required from applicants; (ii) create a link to the records of other public authorities for the purpose of data exchange; (iii) do not search for data already existing in the records of other public authorities; (iv) introduce changes, if necessary, in source systems (registers); (v) promote a process approach to developing the required functionalities with the aim of maximally reducing  points with the possibility of making discretionary decisions; (vi) communicate in an electronic way, that is faster, easier, cheaper and more precise than paper; and (vii) aim to ensure that the user always selects from a set of known values, i.e. to minimize the possibility of free entry.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Open Data Policy</p><p>On 19 July 2018, the government of the Republic of Croatia adopted the <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/SDURDD-dokumenti/POLITIKA OTVORENIH PODATAKA.pdf">Open Data Policy</a>.

For authorised users, an online review and approval process is available;</li><li><strong>Real Property Registration and Cadastre Joint Information System</strong> (JIS OSS) – It allows users to submit their land registry (LR) extracts from the main book or books of deposited contracts for real estate rights. Digitally signed documents are created and downloaded in the OSS system upon payment of fees;</li><li><strong>Registration of a company via the internet</strong> – This service enables the submission of requests and documents for registering a limited liability company via the internet. The service will provide the founders with the registration decisions and other documents in electronic form via a notice sent to an eCitizen Personal Mailbox or per e-mail;</li><li><strong>Consent in the procedures under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior</strong> – According to the law, in the Republic of Croatia both parents must participate in the process of issuing passports or identity cards for minors. Also, both parents have to agree on the minors’ address of permanent residence. This new eService offers the possibility for one parent, EU/EEA citizen, to give his/her consent to the other parent to complete the process of issuing ID documents (ID card or passport) for their child or to change the child’s address of permanent residence. eServices also offer the possibility for EU/EEA citizens, who are owners or part-owners of real estate on the territory of the Republic of Croatia, to give their consent to another adult person for registration of permanent residence at the address of that real estate property. These eServices require a high-level electronic identity credential;</li><li><strong>eNautics</strong> – This service enables online notification of the arrival of foreign vessels or Croatian boats in Croatian territorial waters, with a view to paying the safety or navigation fees, and the download of the electronic receipt as proof of payment;</li><li><strong>eSeafarer</strong> – This service enables submission of applications for boat skipper exams. Upon passing the exam, the candidate will receive a certificate of competency as a boat skipper;</li><li><strong>eVessels</strong> – This service is intended for owners of Croatian-flagged vessels and provides the possibility to search and view data from the Register of Ships. In particular, it enables owners of vessels to have a complete insight into information about their vessels, such as applicable fees and charges and conducted technical inspections, and it enables owners of vessels to submit an application for a regular technical inspection; and</li><li><strong>Electronic Public Procurement System of the Republic of Croatia</strong> – The system (EOJN RH/EPPS) is a platform for conducting public procurement procedures in accordance with the Public Procurement Law and announcing procedures in accordance with the Law on Concessions. The EPPS gives all interested entities unrestricted and immediate access, and enables them to search, view and download public procurement notices and related tender documents. The EPPS enables economic operators to prepare and submit bids, and contracting authorities and economic operators can communicate and exchange information by electronic means through the EPPS.</li></ul><p>Currently, 19 services are available through the eCitizen portal for EU/EEA citizens.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle">National Strategy on Cybersecurity</p><p>Recognising the importance of security of cyberspace as a shared responsibility of all segments of society, in October 2015 the Croatian government adopted a <a href="https://www.uvns.hr/en/legislation/information-security-290/cyber-security">National Strategy on Cybersecurity</a> together with an Action Plan. Its purpose was a systematic and coordinated implementation of activities necessary to raise the capacity of the Republic of Croatia in the field of cybersecurity, in order to build a safe society in the cyberspace. The general aim of this strategy was also to exploit the market potential of the information society, in particular of cybersecurity products and services. Since it was the first comprehensive strategy in the Republic of Croatia in the field of cybersecurity, the primary objective was to identify organisational problems in its implementation and raise awareness in society about the importance of this issue. It was necessary to encourage the coordination and cooperation of all State bodies and public authorities, but also other sectors of society, in order to establish new functionalities, raise the efficiency of relevant stakeholders, use existing resources more effectively and better plan usage needs. </p><p>In 2017, the government of the Republic of Croatia renewed its <a href="https://www.uvns.hr/en/legislation/national-security">National Security Strategy</a>. Strategic goals of the strategy are: achieving the highest level of security and protection of the population and critical infrastructure, establishing and developing a homeland system security, developing and maintaining a strong and active defence, eco Croatia and developing a strong and sustainable economy, demographic renewal and revitalisation and the Croatian society, developing citizen-friendly public administration and strategic communication, protecting, strengthening and promoting highest constitutional values and the Croatian national identity, increasing the international reputation and influence of the Republic of Croatia. The Republic of Croatia will develop measures of strengthening resistance of information and communication systems in cyberspace as well as of reducing negative consequences of their endangering or incapacitation. The emphasis is on the key systems for normal functioning of the state institutions, storage, transmission and exchange of the classified and personal data of the citizens. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle">Public Administration Development Strategy 2015–2020</p><p>The <a href="http://infoz.ffzg.hr/INFuture/2015/images/papers/1-05 Lepri, Croatian Strategy for the Development of Public Administration 2015-20.pdf">Public Administration Development Strategy 2015–2020</a> was adopted by the Croatian Parliament in June 2015. The strategy presented a strategic framework for public administration development, and an orientation towards enhancing administrative capacities and a better organisation of public administration. The development of a modern public administration was conducted in three main directions: (i) the simplification and modernisation of administrative procedures to ensure the reliable and fast support of public administration to citizens and economic entities; (ii) the improvement of the development and management of human resources with the aim of creating a modern public service; and (iii) the reform of the administrative system to align it with European standards.  </p><p>Taking into account the need to harmonise the Action Plan with the 2015–2020 Public Administration Development Strategy, the 2016–2020 Government Programme and the prerequisites for the fulfilment of ex-ante conditionalities, the Croatian government adopted the Action Plan for the implementation of the 2017–2020 Public Administration Development Strategy in December 2016.</p><p class="subtitle">2012–2020 National Healthcare Strategy</p><p>The <a href="https://zdravlje.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/Programi, projekti i strategije/Skracena Nacionalna strategija razvoja zdravstva - HRV - za web.pdf">2012–2020 National Healthcare Strategy </a>is the umbrella document determining the context, vision, priorities, goals and key measures in healthcare in the Republic of Croatia in the period 2012–2020. The time horizon until 2020 was selected because it provides sufficient time for implementation and evaluation of the strategic measures, and it coincides with key strategic documents of the EU and World Health Organisation (WHO).</p><p>Part of this strategy focuses on the informatisation and eHealth within the Central Healthcare Information System in Croatia (CEZIH). CEZIH, with more than 17 000 users and a large number of information systems, makes a good basis for the informatisation of the entire healthcare system in Croatia. On 2 January 2011, the ePrescription was introduced and complete national coverage was achieved, which was a significant step towards achieving a ‛paperless office’. On 15 January 2011, full national coverage of eReferral was achieved for biochemical laboratories, and since then millions of electronic referrals and results of laboratory examinations have been exchanged through the system. Another effect of modernisation was the increase in information technology literacy among healthcare workers. Overall, there were five key purposes of the informatisation of the healthcare in Croatia:</p><ul><li>To contribute directly to the improvement of healthcare service quality, safety and consistency;</li><li>To provide better communication between all participants in the healthcare sector through central management of patients’ data, in primary, secondary and tertiary care (electronic medical record), a centralised process management in the healthcare system (e.g. eAppointment) and a connection to all healthcare registers;</li><li>to achieve complete availability of healthcare to patients through quick and secure access to their own health records, as well as to information on health services and the quality of healthcare;</li><li>to enhance the efficiency of the administration and improve the management of the healthcare system by building an advanced reporting system, including all data in the healthcare system. This would support healthcare authorities and decision makers, and allow for a more efficient spending of resources; and</li><li>to align the health system with the political goals of digitisation of the public sector and provision of electronic services to the population, in coordination with other State administration bodies and in accordance with the strategy of the Republic of Croatia and eCroatia.</li></ul><p>Since 2019, Croatia can send and receive ePrescriptions across borders and receive patient summaries of citizens coming from other European countries. The ePrescription service allows any EU citizen to obtain medicines or other types of medications in any pharmacy located in another Member State. In addition, the patient summaries provide background information on important health-related issues that a patient could have, such as allergies, treatments, previous surgeries, etc., making it accessible to all doctors in case of a medical emergency in another Member State. </p><p class="subtitle">eJustice</p><p>Strengthening the efficiency of the judiciary was one of the objectives in the <a href="https://pravosudje.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti/Strategije, planovi, izvjeÅ¡Äa/Planovi/StrateÅ¡ki plan Ministarstva pravosuÄa za razdoblje 2019 do 2021..pdf">S</a>trategic Plan of the Ministry of Justice for the period 2019–2021, emphasising the use of solutions based on complex algorithms and AI in order to increase the efficiency of the proceedings. Also, electronic communication in courts is advancing and all commercial courts are now equipped for eCommunication with lawyers, notaries and prosecutors. Online payment of court fees is incentivised by offering a 50% discount in case of immediate payment and online submission of a claim. As of 2019, personal and corporate insolvency documents should be delivered from FINA to the courts electronically. A pilot project is testing the central postal delivery of court documents.</p><p class="subtitle">eSchool</p><p>As part of a new curriculum in 2018, obligatory ICT classes were introduced in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> grades of primary school. <a href="https://www.carnet.hr/o_carnetu/eu_projekti/e-skole">eSchool: Establishing a System for Developing Digitally Mature Schools (pilot project)</a> was a successful pilot project in the Republic of Croatia in the field of eEducation which was completed in August 2018. Through the pilot project, the schools were equipped with local area networks (LAN), digital classrooms and tablets. Digital educational content and drafts for science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects were prepared for primary schools and high schools. Several eServices were created, including digital repositories of educational content, education organisation applications, classroom management systems and an IT system for the digitisation of the institutions. The framework for the digital maturity of schools and the digital competence of principals, teachers and professional associates was developed. By ensuring more advanced, transparent and interlinked administrative and teaching processes in schools, the necessary preconditions for the use of ICT were created.</p><p>Based on the experience and results of this pilot project, the Croatian Academic and Research Network (CARNET) started implementing the second phase of the programme, i.e. eSchools: Development of a System of Digitally Mature Schools (Phase II) in September 2018. Phase II of the programme will last until 31 December 2022 and its purpose is to implement the comprehensive system into public schools in the Republic of Croatia. The programme’s budget is worth HRK 1.3 billion. Like the pilot project, the second phase of the programme is financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under the Operational Programme ‘Competitiveness and Cohesion’ and the European Social Fund (ESF) under the Operational Programme ‘Effective Human Resources’. </p><p>In digitally mature schools, teachers use technology to improve teaching, develop their own digital content, and support independent learning and development of critical skills among students, who are at the core of the teaching process. Students thus actively participate in teaching with increased motivation to learn and continue their education, and thus become more competitive in the labour market. The management of eSchools is efficient and transparent, and communication and exchange of eDocuments between the school, its stakeholders and founders are much simpler.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Statement on Cooperation for Artificial Intelligence</p><p>In July 2018, the Minister of Economy, Entrepreneurship and Crafts signed a Statement on Cooperation in the field of Artificial Intelligence. In this way, the Republic of Croatia committed itself to cooperating on a comprehensive and integrated European approach to AI, and agreed to promote European technology and industrial capacity in AI, including better access to public sector information.</p><p>Regarding the development of AI, the <a href="https://cai.fer.hr/">Centre for Artificial Intelligence (CAI)</a> was established in October 2019 and is the largest research centre in the field of AI in Croatia, bringing together more than 100 researchers (faculty and doctoral students) from 18 research laboratories at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb, Croatia. The CAI has three primary goals. The first one is to advance the theoretical foundations of AI and to make progress in areas related to AI, such as machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, financial analytics, robotics, the IoT, bioinformatics, cybersecurity and referral systems. The second objective is to collaborate with industry through the transfer of AI technology to develop new innovative knowledge-based products and services. The third goal is to provide cutting-edge AI education at the undergraduate, graduate and doctoral levels, as well as continuing education for the industry.</p><p>As for high-performance computing, Croatia has signed the European High-Performance Computing (HPC) Declaration, aimed at developing European high-performance computers that will be among the three strongest computers in the world by 2022–2023. Currently, Croatia is working on the establishment of HPC competence centres that could be used by companies and public administration.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.srce.unizg.hr/hr-zoo/">Croatian Scientific and Educational Cloud (HR-ZOO)</a> project is ongoing, with the objective of building a distributed national eInfrastructure consisting of computing, storage and network resources for the purpose of building the research, development and innovation (RDI) capacity of the Croatian Scientific and Academic community. The total value of the project is EUR 25 895 058 (with an EU co-financing of EUR 22 010 799) over a timeframe from 1 July 2017 until 1 September 2021. HR-ZOO is recognised as an important prerequisite for the development of the Croatian research and higher education area, as well as a common infrastructure for the needs of modern science and education, and internationally relevant research, but also as an instrument of integration into the European Research Area (ERA) and the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). The University Computing Centre (SRCE) coordinates the project. Other key institutions from the science and education sectors are involved in the project, such as: Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, University of Rijeka, University of Split, University of Zagreb, CARNET and the Ruđer Bošković Institute.</p><p><img src="img/35-795.jpeg" alt="A gavel on a desk

During the project, a reporting system will also be developed.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474997"></a>Central State Office for the Development of the Digital Society</p><p>Following the Law on the Organisation and Scope of Ministries and Other Central Government Bodies, which entered into force in November 2016, the Digital Information Documentation Office became a part of the <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/">Central State Office for the Development of the Digital Society</a>.</p><p>The former Digital Information Documentation Office was the official government service for the dissemination of information, documentation and referral. It provided a central information and documentation portal for public official information and documents. The documentation included laws, regulations, State documents, official studies and other similar data. The storage was permanently allocated in DAMIR, the Digital Archives of Web Sources of the Republic of Croatia. The Digital Information Documentation Office ensured the availability of public official data, information and documents while promoting their use. </p><p class="subtitle">Higher Education Institutions Information System - Undergraduate Studies (ISVU)</p><p>The <a href="http://www.isvu.hr/javno/hr/index.shtml">Higher Education Institutions Information System - Undergraduate Studies (ISVU)</a> is a network-oriented system intended for the informatisation of all student services at higher education institutions that offer graduate education. It offers access via the internet, regardless of user data and location, and serves as a powerful integration solution at tertiary level through the creation of a data warehouse. The Ministry of Science and Education provides funding for the development and the daily operations of ISVU and monitors the system performance. </p><p class="subtitle">EUROVOC Thesaurus</p><p><a href="https://op.europa.eu/fr/web/eu-vocabularies/th-dataset/-/resource/dataset/eurovoc">EuroVoc</a> is a multilingual, multidisciplinary thesaurus covering the activities of the EU in general, and the European Parliament in particular. It contains over 6 600 structurally organised and controlled terms (descriptors) in 22 EU languages, including Croatian. The Croatian equivalent (<em>CROVOC</em>) was translated by the<strong> </strong>Digital Information Documentation Office for subject indexing of official documentation in the Republic of Croatia. </p><p>The Digital Information Documentation Office and the Library of the Croatian Parliament have developed a Croatian Addendum, which includes: </p><ul><li>A glossary of the names of Croatian government bodies, political parties and geographic terms, accompanied by the special designation <em>CROVOC</em> added to the end of the hierarchical structure of the thesaurus as a separate field; and</li><li>Descriptors incorporated into the structure of the original, accompanied by the special designation <em>CROVOC</em>. </li></ul><p class="subtitle">Croatian National Educational Standard</p><p>The <a href="https://mzo.gov.hr/istaknute-teme/odgoj-i-obrazovanje/nacionalni-kurikulum/125">Croatian National Educational Standard (CNES)</a> was created to foster change in the teaching programme and work methods of the elementary school system, in order to develop schools tailored to pupils. The purpose of the CNES is to reduce the workload by abandoning redundant educational programmes, and to introduce modern teaching methods based on research-based classes, and individual and group work, as well as applicable knowledge and skills.</p><p class="subtitle">Project for the establishment of integrated systems for the management of official documents</p><p>The <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/eu-projekti/uspostava-integralnog-sustava-za-upravljanje-sluzbenom-dokumentacijom-republike-hrvatske/330">project for the establishment of integrated systems for the management of official documents</a> is carried out by the Central State Office for the Development of the Digital Society. The implementation of the project includes the establishment of an integrated system to manage the official documentation of the Republic of Croatia, the availability of documents to end users, the development of the search engine Cadial and better awareness of civil servants’ legal obligations under the Law on Access to Information.</p><p>The project is directly funded under priority axis 4 ‘Good Governance’, specific goal 11.i.1 ‘Increasing Effectiveness and Capacity in Public Administration through Improved Service Provision and Human Resources Management’, of the 2014–2020 Operational Programme ‘Effective Human Resources’. </p><p>The project aim is to ensure a higher level of openness, transparency and availability of official documents through permanent availability, and the possibility to reuse public official documents and information for all interested parties under equal conditions, impartially and free of charge.</p><p class="subtitle">Project for process informatisation and establishment of an integral electronic service for admission in education institutions</p><p>The <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/informatizacija-procesa-i-uspostava-cjelovite-elektronicke-usluge-upisa-u-odgojne-i-obrazovne-ustanove/1574">project for process informatisation and establishment of an integral electronic service for admission in education institutions</a> was prepared in collaboration with the Ministry of Labour and Pension System for the purpose of applying for co-financing through the ESF within the 2014–2020 Operational Programme ‘Effective Human Resources’. The start of implementation was expected at the beginning of 2019 and the whole project should be completed within three years. </p><p>The goal of the project is to digitise processes in educational institutions and enable Croatian citizens to enrol in programmes that these institutions offer through electronic services, entirely without the need to fill out forms. The data required for admission in education institutions will be obtained electronically from the bodies responsible for these data, in accordance with the provisions of the State Information Infrastructure Act.</p><p>The service will digitalise the processes of application to and enrolment in institutions of early and pre-school education, in primary schools, in secondary schools, in dormitories and in higher education institutions, as well as the registration in the State graduation register and the national adult education information system.</p><p>The electronic services developed by the project will be made available to citizens through the eCitizen system, with the first visible deliveries in 2020. The project implementation period is from 12 March 2019 until 12 March 2022, with a total project value of HRK 40 002 019.64.</p><h2>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle">Cooperation Network</p><p>Regarding the eID, the process of eIDAS notification (application) of the NIAS with the <a href="https://www.eid.hr/hr/eoi">Croatian Electronic Identity Card</a> (eOI), as national scheme for other Member States via the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/EIDCOMMUNITY/Cooperation+Network+Resources">Cooperation Network</a>, is successfully completed. This provided a tool for the recognition of the electronic identities of Croatian citizens to access online cross-border public services in the EU. In this way, all the prerequisites for Croatian citizens to log in to public eServices in other Member States using the eOI are fulfilled. </p><p>Currently, the Croatian eIDAS node is connected in production with the eIDAS nodes of the following seven Member States: Belgium, Luxembourg, Latvia, Estonia, Slovakia, Spain, and Italy, forwarding the identification data on the authenticated EU user to the selected public eService which the user wants to access through NIAS. Currently, about ten more Member States are in the testing phase in order to connect the Croatian eIDAS node with their nodes.</p><p>At the same time, some EU citizens (from countries which have completed the notification process) can access the electronic services of the Croatian administration.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Metaregistry</p><p>The <a href="https://metaregistar.gov.hr/metareg/html/">Metaregistry</a> is a public register which is part of the Central Interoperability System (SII) and is used to control the system of all public registers. It contains detailed information on public registers and the data they hold and communicates this to users through a single point. In this way, it provides an overview of the structured public registers, the type of data that is collected and hosted, as well as how to connect with other systems. The Metaregistry is in compliance with the applicable regulations on personal data protection, data confidentiality and the right of access to information. The Metaregistry is still not fully operational, but Croatia’s increased efforts in recent years should ensure its functionality as soon as possible.</p><p>The Metaregistry is a prerequisite for a country aiming for a paperless administration and the implementation of the Once-Only principle. A paperless State creates a single administrative location with connected registration systems to ensure the availability of data. This relieves the administrative burden on citizens, who do not have to transfer documents between different institutions themselves.</p><p class="subtitle">Shared Services Centre</p><p>According to the applicable decree, the Shared Services Centre is an organisational business model for providing shared services to public sector bodies and other users, consisting of a normative framework and a governance structure in accordance with the regulation and the acts adopted pursuant to the decree. The Shared Services Centre provides common business solutions and common ICT services, and its establishment, extension, maintenance and management is within the competence of the central State administration body responsible for eCroatia affairs.  </p><p>The Shared Services Centre aims to increase the use of ICT in communication between citizens and public administration through the establishment of an ICT coordination and software solution. The expected outcome is to increase the use of eGovernment services by citizens, which is assessed in terms of the frequency of use of eGovernment services by individuals, and to increase the number of residents communicating with public institutions. Specific results to be achieved include the functioning of the State cloud and the strengthening of the use of eServices in specific sectors defined in the digital strategy, i.e. the increase in the percentage of public institutions integrated in the cloud and the number of complex eServices provided to users.</p><p class="subtitle">Cadastral Data Browser</p><p>The <a href="https://www.katastar.hr/#/">Cadastral Data Browser</a> provides insight into the central cadastre database of Croatia, which incorporates all cadastral offices. The eCadastre service enables control over cadastre plots, authentication of data entries, as well as the latest data changes and documentation based on the modifications performed. </p><p class="subtitle">eCourt Registry</p><p>The <a href="https://sudreg.pravosudje.hr/registar/f?p=150:1">eCourt Registry</a> contains all existing entities, including trading companies, co-ops and institutions. Through automation of certain administrative and accounting judicial operations, and access to criminal and minor offence records, it enables simpler registration of business entities (full online company registration) and simpler access to Court Registry data.</p><p class="subtitle">eCREW</p><p>The <a href="https://eplovilo.pomorstvo.hr/">eCREW</a> system enables all legal and natural entities who rent yachts and boats to register their crew and passengers via the internet, prior to putting out to sea, using smart cards with a digital certificate based on acquired user rights. The aim is to expedite business processes at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Infrastructure with business subjects (charter companies) relating to charter vessels, to secure a complete monitoring over the procedure of renting vessels by all authorised bodies of the State administration, and, in that way, to prevent illegal chartering. </p><p class="subtitle">Central Database Registry on Personal Data</p><p>Registry offices in the country keep national records on Registries of Births, Marriages and Deaths. Data on citizens’ personal status is entered into local databases and replicated into the <a href="https://mpu.gov.hr/drzavne-matice-24504/24504">Central Database Registry on Personal Data</a> at the Ministry of Justice and Administration. </p><p class="subtitle">Personal Identification Number Registry</p><p>Personal identification numbers are given to natural and legal persons. The <a href="https://oib.oib.hr/SaznajOibWeb/fizickaOsoba.html">Personal Identification Number (OIB/PIN) Registry</a> receives updates on natural persons from the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages, and about legal persons from the Registries of Non-profit Institutions (eight registries) as well as from the Court Registry on Legal Entities. The data exchanged gives a clear indication of changes in the life events and status of Croatia’s citizens. This information is then shared (upon request or by submitting a notification) with other relevant registries, such as the Pension Registry or the Tax Administration Registry. All relevant government bodies involved in the implementation of the OIB/PIN project update their information systems whenever necessary to include processes related to the personal identification number. The Tax Administration (which also performs the duties of a Tax Registry), the Land and the Commercial Registries are centralised by default.</p><p class="subtitle">HITRONet</p><p><a href="https://uprava.gov.hr/o-ministarstvu/ustrojstvo/uprava-za-e-hrvatsku/aktualni-projekti/hitronet/873">HITRONet </a>is the communication system that represents the backbone of the public administration network. By linking public authorities at national level, it is the core of a comprehensive communications system, which fulfils the needs associated to eGovernment and is also an indispensable infrastructure for its further development. Access to the network is enabled by a virtual private network model through an internet communication environment. In addition, HITRONet is connected to the STESTA network (Secured Trans-European Services for Telematics between Administrations), a separate EU network, which is Croatia’s point of connection to the EU.</p><p><img src="img/35-825.jpeg" alt="A person holding a trophy
