These indicators are clustered within four main top-level benchmarks:</p><ul><li><strong>User Centricity</strong> – indicates the extent to which (information about) a service is provided online and how this is perceived.</li><li><strong>Transparency</strong> – indicates the extent to which governments are transparent regarding: i) their own responsibilities and performance, ii) the process of service delivery and iii) personal data involved.</li><li><strong>Cross-Border Mobility</strong> – indicates the extent to which EU citizens and businesses can use online services in another country.</li><li><strong>Key Enablers</strong> – indicates the extent to which five technical pre-conditions are available online. There are: Identification (eID), Electronic documents (eDocuments), Authoritative Sources, and Digital Post. Digital Post refers to the possibility that governments communicate electronically-only with citizens or entrepreneurs through e.g. personal mailboxes or other digital mail solutions.</li></ul><p>These top-level benchmarks are measured using a life-events (e.g. mystery shopping) approach.

There is such a central component in Bulgaria - the <a href="https://e-gov.bg/bg/143">Registry Information Exchange System</a> (RegiX). The environment is managed by the State eGovernment Agency.</p><p>RegiX is an infrastructure that enables the automated interconnections between multiple Bulgarian registries (currently 62), as well as information systems, in the form of machine-to-machine services. RegiX has been developed as part of the central eGovernment system. The environment for automated interconnections between registries is defined as a way of facilitating interaction between administrations, with the goal of providing integrated administrative services. This would lead to administrative authorities that provide public services, not to require citizens or organisations to provide more than once the data that the administration already has. Instead, they must collect it officially from the primary administrator of the data. Via RegiX, notification and request for data is done electronically and automatically as an internal electronic administrative service. Transactions have increased more than 16 times.</p><h1><a id="_Toc13221565"></a>Digital Government Services for Citizens </h1><p>The information in this section presents an overview of the basic public services provided to the citizens.
