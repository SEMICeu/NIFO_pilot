The focus for 2018—2021 was:</p><ul><li>Increasing self-services through the national portal Island.is;</li><li>Strengthening the IT infrastructure; and</li><li>Increasing public agencies cooperation with the help of IT e.g. cloud solutions.</li></ul><p>The Parliament announced the political strategy for digital efforts in the <a href="https://www.stjornarradid.is/library/01--Frettatengt---myndir-og-skrar/FJR/FJR_Fjarmalaaetlun_V5.pdf">fiscal plan for 2021—2025.</a> </p><p>The focus of the coming semesters will be threefold:</p><ul><li>Urgent investments to reduce operational risk and meet the requirements for the basic services of institutions;</li><li>Strengthening technological infrastructure that contributes to increased operational efficiency, increased safety, flexibility or capacity; and</li><li>Definition of opportunities that contribute to increased development and utilisation of new technologies for improved service, increased security and efficiency. Such projects are related to e.g. strong co-operation with the Nordic and Baltic countries, in line with the Digital North declaration of cooperation. The EU also recently launched the Europe Fit for the Digital Age programme, which aims to systematically build digital infrastructure and facilitate the widespread deployment of digital technologies for government, citizens and businesses. Iceland fully participates in the programme.</li></ul><p>A policy on public digital services was published in the consultation portal in April 2021. It outlines the government’s vision for the use of information technology and digital services to provide excellent services in a secure manner. It is also intended to strengthen Iceland's competitive position and increase prosperity through innovation and a more efficient society.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Iceland </p><p>The technical policy of Digital Iceland was published in 2019. The policy sets a technical framework for all projects carried out under the leadership of both the Ministry of Local and Economic Affairs and the task force Digital Iceland, in cooperation with all agencies, municipalities, ministries and enterprises. The strategy is an important part of the government's plan on improved digital communication to the public. It also supports the objectives defined in the Nordic/Baltic Partnership, as stated in the Digital North Declaration. </p><p>To ensure progress, in the wide range of public digital projects planned, Digital Iceland published a tender in December 2019. In the tender, Digital Iceland requested to enter an agreement with up to eighteen teams to work on digital public solutions for the national portal <a href="https://island.is/">Island.is</a>.</p><p>A revamped portal for public services, <a href="https://island.is/">Island.is</a>, was launched in 2020 and it aims to be the central point of access for most digital public processes.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital North</p><p>The ministerial declaration <a href="https://www.norden.org/en/declaration/nordic-baltic-region-digital-frontrunner">Digital North</a> was signed in 2017 by the Ministers for Digital Development of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Greenland, Åland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.

The <a href="https://www.government.is/news/article/2018/01/18/Fjarskipti-Island-ljostengt/" target="_blank">Iceland Rural Fibre Project</a> is a government initiative to roll out fibre to nearly all legal homes in rural areas from 2016 to 2021. The State contributes to the funding of the project, and local governments can apply for subsidies that depend on their own contributions. The project is overseen by the Telecommunications Fund. Fibre-rollout in rural areas also plays a role in upgrading core communications systems nationwide, which is a prerequisite for greater reliability, coverage, and data-transmission speed across all mobile networks for the whole country. The project will end successfully in 2021 and will contribute to the main broadband policy goal, namely that 99.9% of households and businesses nationwide have access to fibre connections by the end of 2025. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">Unique IT Supplier for the Entire Public Sector</p><p>On 1 June 2019, Iceland became the first country to sign a contract which will make Microsoft the sole IT supplier for its entire public sector. The country teamed up with a single IT partner for the provision of a common cloud platform: Microsoft 365.</p><p>The introduction of Microsoft 365 aims to consolidate all services into a single license, while guaranteeing increased communication and collaboration between institutions. </p><p>Peter Quarfordts Skov, Public Sector Director at Microsoft Denmark &amp; Iceland, commented that the contract marked a shift in the way public sector and public services are perceived. He added that, as more countries digitalise their public services, there is an increasing need to enhance services, products and processes, not to mention the level of security. Even though the decision should lead to an increased interoperability among different public bodies, the risk of a vendor lock-in is higher.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk67487692"></a>National Interoperability Framework </p><p>National research on how to improve interoperability has indicated that interoperability can only be enhanced through comprehensive harmonisation and communication between systems, suggesting the need for new strategies and corresponding frameworks. Several parties, led by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, are involved in the establishment of a framework including all government levels, public institutions and private entities.</p><p>One part of the framework, namely the ‘<a href="https://www.stjornarradid.is/efst-a-baugi/frettir/stok-frett/2020/10/27/Landsarkitektur-upplysingaoryggis-i-samradsgatt-/">Coordination of the public entities arrangements regarding information security</a>’, was put in a <a href="https://samradsgatt.island.is/oll-mal/$Cases/Details/?id=2817">general consultation process</a> in the government's consultation portal in the second half of the 2020.</p><p>The <a href="https://samradsgatt.island.is/Skrar/$Cases/GetCaseFile/?id={dec2a011-8417-eb11-9b9b-005056bcce7e}">National Architecture on Information Security</a> is intended to guide institutions on how they can strengthen network security and harmonize working methods across the public sector. It is one of the eight chapters in the technical architecture of public entities:</p><p> </p><ul><li>Architecture is managed at the appropriate level based on a common framework</li><li>Architecture promotes harmonization, innovation and efficiency</li><li>Architecture and legal environment support each other</li><li>Security, privacy and confidentiality are guaranteed</li><li>Processes between public bodies are efficient and automatic</li><li>Data is shared between public bodies and reused</li><li>IT solutions and systems work seamlessly together</li><li>Data is delivered and services are provided reliably</li></ul><p>The National Architecture on Information Security is therefore a more detailed definition of the fourth chapter in the technology architecture. Work on other chapters is ongoing and they will be published as the work progresses and will thus form one whole.</p><p>As reported in chapter 6.3, Iceland has adapted the X-Road data exchange layer which is based on API structure.

The strategy was meant to cover the period 2015—2026. The strategy established the Cyber Security Council, which was assigned a key role in implementing the strategy and its action plan. It is composed of representatives from ministries and authorities in charge of cyber-related issues. It has proven to be a very useful platform for information exchange and coordination. Furthermore, the strategy established the Cyber Security Forum, a platform for cooperation between the public and private sectors. </p><p>In June 2019, the Parliament of Iceland agreed on a parliamentary resolution put forward by the government containing new strategies for cyber security, as well as for communication, postal services and Registers Iceland. The resolution was prepared by the Minister for Transport and Local Government, who is responsible for cyber security within the government. This <a href="https://www.althingi.is/altext/149/s/1688.html">new cybersecurity strategy</a> is valid for the years 2019—2033 and therefore replaces the previous one. The Parliament also approved a corresponding resolution containing an <a href="https://www.althingi.is/altext/149/s/0544.html">action plan</a> for the same time period. The new strategy pursues similar goals to the previous one, but it has more political weight as it was put forward by the government and approved by Parliament.</p><p>A secure cyber space is considered one of the main cornerstones for economic prosperity in Iceland.

The report concluded that Iceland is well placed to deal with the development and use of artificial intelligence due to the following elements:</p><ul><li>Citizens have high trust in public bodies and businesses operating in public services;</li><li>Public bodies and businesses are technically advanced and IT based;</li><li>The public sector possesses technological infrastructures and has been collecting data for several decades; </li><li>Institutions have based their activities on IT and access to knowledge; and</li><li>Good cooperation between employers’ associations, labour unions and the government facilitates the reorganisation of the labour market, adapting it to the changes brought about by the fourth industrial revolution. </li></ul><p>The status report pointed out that, as the Icelandic community is characterised by trust and respect for fundamental values such as human rights and privacy, it is necessary for the government to develop an artificial intelligence policy which preserves the rights and freedoms of the individuals. </p><p>The government should focus on the following guiding principles:</p><ul><li>The development of artificial intelligence should respect the society’s moral values as well as human rights and democracy;</li><li>The development and use of artificial intelligence should guarantee the integrity and fairness of communication and decision-making processes;</li><li>Artificial intelligence research, development and use should promote and ensure responsible and trusted solutions.

Katrín Jakobsdóttir, Prime Minister, has appointed a committee to submit proposals for a clear vision for the future on how the Icelandic society can work with AI for the benefit of all. The committee is intended to answer the following questions:</p><ul><li>What are the rights of Icelanders towards new technology?</li><li>What should be the role of AI technology in Icelandic society?</li><li>What value should Icelandic society have in mind when introducing new technology? and</li><li>At what level will Iceland discuss and resolve issues that arise regarding the implementation or use of new technology?</li></ul><p>The project is part of an action plan for Iceland in the fourth industrial revolution, and the committee consists of individuals with diverse backgrounds and expertise, including ethics, technology, the labour market and societal changes due to new technology.

The network supports multicast and traffic prioritisation and is also connected to the <a href="http://www.rhnet.is/english/">University and Research Network</a> (RH Net).</p><p class="subtitle">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><p>Iceland uses the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/testa_en">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</a> (TESTA) network as the main cross border infrastructure to communicate digitally among the EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk67487775"></a><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>Straumurinn/X-Road</p><p>On 30<sup> </sup>November 2018, Iceland signed an agreement with the NIIS Institute (Nordic Institute for Interoperability Solutions), which co-operates with Estonia and Finland, to start using <em>Straumurinn</em> data line. <em>Straumurinn</em> is based on the Estonian X-Road platform and it has already been implemented and tested in Estonia and Finland.</p><p>This system will foster synergies between the different public bodies’ IT systems by streamlining and automating data exchange processes. <em>Straumurinn</em> is the Icelandic way to grant efficiency and security in information exchanges. The basic set-up phase has been concluded and the first services are available through the X-Road environment, enabling government agencies and ministries to exchange information through a standardised and secure solution. <em>Straumurinn</em> also allows for a more secure and flexible data exchange with businesses, as well as a more efficient communication. <em>Straumurinn</em> improves the interoperability between IT systems of different public organisations, so that information can be provided once only, and the government can easily retrieve it. </p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a><em>Íslandsrót</em> Certification Authority</p><p><a href="http://www.islandsrot.is/"><em>Íslandsrót</em></a> (Iceland Root) is the certification authority responsible for issuing and distributing eCertificates. It is controlled by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and stands at the top of the organisation pyramid of electronic identification, constituting the trust source in the system of distributed electronic certificates. Thanks to Iceland Root, temporary certificates can be issued and used as such while waiting for the issue of the final certificates. The final certificates can be linked to a specific person, as is the case for private certificates or employee certificates. Various government departments too issue digital certificates. For example, the 1996 amendment to the <a href="http://www.althingi.is/altext/stjt/1996.069.html">Customs Act</a> imposed electronic submissions using digital certificates for all import and export companies. </p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>Tendsign</p><p><a href="https://tendsign.is/login.aspx">TendSign</a> is a Swedish eProcurement platform used by many Swedish and Norwegian public entities. eProcurement, from eNotice to eAward, are implemented with this system. <a href="https://www.rikiskaup.is/">Rikiskaup</a>, the central public procurement entity for government bodies in Iceland, has implemented this platform at national level and is also in the process of implementing eOrdering based on xml standards. </p><p class="subtitle">Financial Management Authority</p><p><a href="https://www.fjs.is/en">The Financial Management Authority (FJS)</a> is an independent agency under the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs.

For over 1 000 years, Icelandic has served not only as the language of Icelanders, but as the medium through which one of Europe’s greatest literary treasures has been preserved: <strong>the medieval sagas</strong>. However, since the advent of computers, Icelandic, like many other languages, has found itself under increasing pressure, particularly due to the extensive use of English. One of the main roles of the centre is to collect information on language technology in Iceland and make it available online to <strong>facilitate</strong> both cooperation among interested parties and the use of available resources.</p><p class="subtitle">Icelandic Library Consortium </p><p>The Icelandic Library Consortium runs a union <strong>catalogue </strong>of<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.landskerfi.is/">Icelandic libraries</a>, known as Gegnir. The company, which was founded in November 2001, is owned by the Icelandic government and a series of municipalities around the country. Its purpose is to run a central, web-based library system for most of the libraries in Iceland, thus making the best possible use of the country’s modest library and information resources. The contract between Ex Libris and the Consortium of Icelandic libraries entails that the new library system is used by all or almost all the approximately 400 libraries in the country, and that legacy data is added to the new system in steps, based on existing systems.</p><p class="subtitle"><em>Vísindavefur </em></p><p>The <a href="http://www.visindavefur.hi.is/">Icelandic Web of Science</a> was established in 2000.

It is now upgrading to the eIDAS node to comply with the eIDAS Regulation and CEF funding, to federate the Icelandic eID systems to the EU eID ecosystem. This will enable the exchange of ID attributes from the Member States’ Population Registries for cross-border identification and authentication.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a><a id="_Hlk67487862"></a>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Current Status</p><p>As to base registries, data accessibility and reusability, some registries - such as the Land Registry, Address Registry and the Map of Estimated Farmland Registry - make their data available free of charge on the <a href="http://www.opingogn.is">open data portal</a>.
