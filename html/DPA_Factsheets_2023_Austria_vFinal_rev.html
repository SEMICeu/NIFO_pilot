The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below. </p><p><img src="img/32-100.png" alt="32-100.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022 </a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Austria in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021.  </p><p><img src="img/32-114.x-emf" alt="32-114.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Austria’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average in Principles 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Although Austria scores at the European average for all the other Principles, the two areas of improvement could be related to Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and Principle 9 (Multilingualism), where Austria received the score of 3. This is due to an incomplete implementation of the corresponding recommendations. Indeed, measures to ensure that Austria’s national interoperability framework and strategies are aligned with the EIF should be improved, as well as measures to further use information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service. These measures would help the country reach the maximum score of 4 in all Principles of the EIF.</p><p><img src="img/32-127.x-emf" alt="32-127.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Austrian results for the implementation of the interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance. The remaining potential area of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 is Interoperability governance. Particularly, the score of 2 for Austria in Recommendations 24, stating that Austria should actively participate in standardisation work relevant to the country’s needs to ensure its requirements are met, lowers the overall interoperability governance result for Austria. Similarly, the same score related to Recommendation 22, which encourages the use of a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assessing and selecting standards and specifications, hinders the country’s results with regard to Interoperability governance.</p><p><img src="img/32-140.x-emf" alt="32-140.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Austria’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an overall good performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations, much aligned with the EU average and also scoring above the EU average in the area of Catalogues. Some improvements to reach the score of 4 in all areas could be made, particularly in relation to Security and Privacy and External information sources and services. For instance, in accordance with Recommendation 47, Austria should further make use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services.</p><p><img src="img/32-148.x-emf" alt="32-148.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Austria concerning Cross-border interoperability in Score 4 show a higher performance of the country in 16 indicators. Particularly, Austria has a high performance with the maximum score of 4 in most areas, with results going significantly above the EU average for Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) as well as Base registries and Internal information sources and services. Nevertheless, Austria still has margin for improvement in relation to Interoperability governance and Security and Privacy. Efforts could focus on consulting relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level, in accordance with the country’s NIF and relevant DIFs, when procuring and developing ICT solutions (Recommendation 23).</p><p>Additional information on Austria’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p> </p><p><img src="img/32-159.png" alt="32-159.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc35533395"></a><a id="_Toc138927066"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk6480820"></a>Digitalisation Strategy - Digital Action Plan Austria</p><p>The vision ‘<a href="https://www.google.at/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjz7oqLjZH2AhXHQ_EDHdPfC58QFnoECA4QAQ&amp;url=https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/dam/jcr:dbf01b8f-1973-4d55-9120-b2d255037809/Bericht_Ziele_barrierefrei_v1.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw3g8sqQlU0zFnawGU9g2GP3">Digital Austria in 2040–2050</a>’ outlines the necessary values and characteristics of a digital responsible society, based on a series of guidelines and principles.

In doing so, Austria pursues the goal to establish and further ensure its role as a leading digital nation, and to guarantee and expand prosperity, job opportunities and quality of life in the long term. As such, the DAA is based on the fundamental consideration that digitisation is not a value in itself, but an enabler to achieve substantial progress in individual policy areas (e.g. climate policy, security policy, economic policy, cultural policy, etc.) from which the general public benefits.</p><p>The DAA consists of thematic action plans, which contain concrete measures and implementation steps on specific priority topics, the most prominent being at the moment <a href="https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/dam/jcr:b931544d-a9be-40d6-b75e-1e2232145177/Die GroÃe Daten-Chance.pdf">data economy</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalaustria.gv.at/dam/jcr:0db5d185-8927-4830-8041-9ed3d5c5cdc7/dia_aktionsplan_wirtschaft_wachstum_RZ.pdf">resilience</a>, although other thematic action plans are foreseen (such as one on sustainability).

The strategy was developed in a collaborative process with the relevant eGovernment stakeholders at national and regional level and pursues an efficient implementation of electronic government services. It is based on the basic premise that all businesses and citizens must be able to perform all the procedures of public administration quickly and easily, electronically and without any specific technical expertise. To achieve this goal, the Federal eGovernment Strategy promotes the involvement of and close cooperation between the federal State, cities and municipalities. The first concrete implementation priorities are to be the broad introduction of ID Austria, the interconnection of service portals and the digital sovereignty. </p><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Austrian government signed the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other European Union (EU) Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc973043"></a><a id="_Toc1035599"></a>Austrian Interoperability Framework</p><p>The establishment of the Austrian public services has been an important initiative representing a common goal among the different initiatives to which the federal government has agreed to. </p><p>The approval of the <a href="https://neu.ref.wien.gv.at/at.gv.wien.ref-live/documents/20189/79767/Austrian_Interoperability_Framework__AIF-1.0.0_.pdf/4bc872de-2f08-4749-b7b9-6aa341ad8ad7?version=1.0">Austrian Interoperability Framework (AIF)</a> in January 2015 set a mutual goal to guide, promote and support the delivery of Austrian public services by fostering cross-border, cross-organisation and cross-sector interoperability. The framework addresses issues such as its underlying principles, the conceptual model for public services, the interoperability levels, the interoperability agreements and the interoperability governance.</p><p>More specifically, the purpose of the AIF is: </p><ul><li>To promote and support the delivery of Austrian public services by fostering cross-border, cross-organisation and cross-sector interoperability; </li><li>To guide public administrations in their work to provide Austrian public services to businesses and citizens; and</li><li>To complement and tie together the various Organisational Interoperability Frameworks (OIFs) at Austrian level. </li></ul><p>This non-technical document is addressed to all those involved in defining, designing and implementing Austrian public services. The AIF should be taken into account when making decisions on Austrian public services that support the implementation of Austrian policy initiatives. It should also be considered when establishing public services that in the future may be reused as part of the Austrian public services. </p><p class="subtitle">Once-Only Principle</p><p>The federal government has identified the Once-Only principle, and herewith the reduction of administrative burdens for citizens and companies, as a key issue to be addressed in the current <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjqrvO45KLvAhXMC2MBHSPPAAMQFjAAegQIAxAD&amp;url=https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/dam/jcr:ab5e616e-f1e8-4755-9cf5-82ea24619593/33_14_mrv.pdf&amp;usg=AOvVaw2LtXhwhHAcb_MPPv5iAIrw">legislative period (2020–2024)</a>. This includes several measures to alleviate the burden of information obligations on businesses and citizens, that should provide their data only once to the administration.</p><p>Thanks to the smart use of back-office data available to a growing number of public authorities, it has become possible to provide citizens with ‘no-stop’ procedures in which visits to or contacts with authorities have been eliminated entirely. For example, Austria grants a family allowance for which no application is necessary, i.e., citizens automatically receive the benefits that they are entitled to without having to complete or send in any form. Since the implementation of the measure in May 2015, families have automatically received the allowance granted at the birth of a child without having to apply for it. Overall, an estimated 80 000 families a year benefit from this ‘no-stop shop’ solution.</p><p>At the same time, the Austrian government places strong emphasis on improving the framework conditions for companies. This includes taking concrete measures to reduce the information obligations for businesses, thus alleviating their administrative burden. </p><p>Following the adoption of the Business Service Portal Act - that entered into force on 27 July 2021 - the Once-Only Platform was implemented, including the Register and System Network (<a href="https://www.usp.gv.at/rsv-hilfe.html">dadeX - Digital Austria Data Exchange</a>) and the <a href="https://www.usp.gv.at/ivdb-hilfe/datenschutz.html">Information Obligation Database</a>. Based on this infrastructure, the following use cases were implemented between the second quarter of 2022 and the first quarter 2023:</p><ul><li>Criminal records and financial criminal records are checked automatically via dadeX when issuing a business license, leading to a faster process for more than 90 000 business licenses each year;</li><li>The continued entitlement to the family allowance is checked automatically via dadeX for school kids and apprentices, thereby reducing the submission of forms and paperwork;</li><li>When a one-person limited company is started, the company register evidence is traded automatically via dadeX between the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance; and</li><li>The proof of income for reduced kindergarten fees for the city of Graz is checked automatically via dadeX, so that parents do not have to submit the proof personally.</li></ul><p>Other use cases will follow in the near future.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key Enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>Open Government Data</p><p>Fostering the provision and use of open government data to increase transparency and create new opportunities for companies is a major cornerstone of the Austrian government programme ‘<a href="https://www.wienerzeitung.at/_em_daten/_wzo/2020/01/02/200102-1510_regierungsprogramm_2020_gesamt.pdf">In Responsibility for Austria - Government Programme 2020–2024</a>’.

Thus, certain information (birth certificates, proof of citizenship, proof of residency or documents from the Commercial Registry) need no longer be provided by the person concerned but can, with the person’s consent or with legal authorisation, be directly requested by the authority from an electronic register.

In 2008 and 2009, the first two privately run delivery services that complied with legal regulations and technical specifications for electronic delivery became operational. Currently, <a href="https://www.bmdw.gv.at/Services/ElektronischeZustellung/Allgemeine-Information-zur-eZustellung.html">five privately run delivery services</a> are active on the market, with 4.5 million deliveries in 2022.

The system brings many advantages to citizens, businesses and public authorities. Just like the letterbox in the paper world, recipients only need one system to receive official notifications as well as private mail in the electronic world. As such, the revised electronic delivery offers great saving potential for public authorities, citizens and businesses (e.g. postage costs, printing costs and time). This central system is called MyPostbox (<em>meinpostkorb</em>). The display module MyPostbox bundles documents from different delivery systems into a common view and allows for a single point of registration.

An electronic file is created for every written request requiring an answer and every internal project of possible future interest. In this way, every procedure can be easily audited anytime by viewing the file. At the federal level, ELAK means that many procedures can now be conducted more efficiently, facilitating inter-administrative transactions, which can now be processed using just one medium. The introduction of ELAK has brought about significant savings.</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, an Electronic File System was launched with further useful features (e.g. team rooms for cross-sector collaboration with private sector partners) and a modernised design.</p><p><img src="img/32-273.png" alt="A picture containing night sky
