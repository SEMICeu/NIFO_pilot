The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-380.x-emf" alt="32-380.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Estonia in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-402.x-emf" alt="32-402.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Estonia’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Possible areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the alignment of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies with the EIF and the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p><img src="img/32-413.x-emf" alt="32-413.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Estonian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall very strong performance with scores of 4 in each layer with the exception of the interoperability governance area. More specifically, the score of 3 for Estonia derives from Recommendation 21, stating that countries should put in place defined processes for the selection and adoption of standards and specifications and from Recommendation 23, stating that relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level should be consulted when procuring and developing IT solutions.</p><p><img src="img/32-425.x-emf" alt="32-425.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Estonia’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with internal and external information sources and services, base registries, open data and catalogues. The implementation of recommendations in the areas of security and privacy have enabled to move from a score of 2 to 3 in 2022. However, there is still room for improvement with security and privacy as well as the conceptual model, where Estonia’s score of 3, are below the one of the EU average. More specifically, the use of trust services to ensure secure data exchange in public services (Security and Privacy - Recommendation 47) and the existence of a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components (Conceptual Model – Recommendation 35) hinder the overall Estonian score with regard to security and privacy and the conceptual model.</p><p><img src="img/32-438.x-emf" alt="32-438.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Estonia concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at least upper-middle performance of the country in 16 indicators despite the lack of data of several indicators. However, Estonia has still margin for improvement. For instance, efforts could focus on putting in place processes to select relevant standards and specifications, evaluate them, monitor their implementation, check compliance and test their interoperability (i.e. Interoperability governance -Recommendation 21) and on the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (i.e. Security and Privacy - Recommendation 47).</p><p>Additional information on Estonia’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="img/32-450.png" alt="32-450.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc140672422"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Joint Declaration on Cooperation for Powering Digital Transformation</p><p>In October 2020, Estonia signed a Joint Declaration of Intent titled<a href="https://toolkit-digitalisierung.de/en/ict-building-blocks-cooperation-digital-transformation/"> ‘Cooperation for Powering Digital Transformation</a>’, so as to cooperate in accelerating the digital transformation and digitalisation of public administration for the achievement of the sustainable development goals.

Since 1 January 2008, the act has also been regulating the field covered by the former <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/32230">Databases Act</a> (in force from 1997 to 2007). A newly revised and updated<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12900546">Public Information Act</a> entered into force on 1 January 2015, starting the transposition of the provisions of the revised <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013L0037">Directive (2013/37/EU)</a> into national law. The full transposition of this Directive is currently under way. The act is enforced by the <a href="https://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a>.</p><p> </p><p>The Public Information Act covers State and local agencies, public law legal entities, and private entities that are performing public duties, including education, healthcare and social or other public services. Any person can make a request for information, which is then registered; the holder of the information has to respond within five working days. Fees are waived if the information is requested for research purposes. Departments and other holders of public information are required to offer websites and post an extensive list of information on the web. These entities are also required to ensure that information is not outdated, inaccurate or misleading. Email requests are treated as official requests for information. </p><p>Further amendments to the Public Information Act came into force in December 2018, introducing requirements regarding the accessibility of websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies. The aim is to improve accessibility so that the public as a whole, but especially people with special needs, can communicate with the government and use digital government services more conveniently and effectively.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/529032019012/consolide">Public Information Act</a> ensures that citizens, businesses and other branches of the public administration have access to information meant for public use. The aim is to create public control mechanisms with regard to the fulfilment of public duties. </p><p class="subtitle">Archives Act </p><p>The <a href="http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/X2058K5.htm">Archives Act</a> entered into force on 1 May 1998, setting the principles that apply to collecting, evaluating, archiving, preserving and accessing archival documents, as well as to archiving activities. In particular, the Archives Act provides guidelines for private records entered in the archives’ register and the transfer of ownership of private records entered in the archives’ register.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474966"></a>Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/527102016001/consolide">Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act</a> was adopted on 12 October 2016, effectively transposing Regulation (EU) No.°910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (eIDAS Regulation). The act also replaced the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/114032014012">Digital Signatures Act</a> (DSA), which had entered into force on 15 December 2000 and had been revised in 2014. The DSA gave digital and handwritten signatures equal legal value and set an obligation for all public institutions to accept digitally signed documents.</p><p>In January 2019, the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/527102016001/consolide/current">amendments to the Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act</a> entered into force.

The act establishes the requirements applying to the maintenance of the network and information systems which are essential for the functioning of the society and the State, as well as of local authorities’ network and information systems. The act also provides for liability and supervision provisions, and serves as a basis for the prevention and resolution of cyber incidents.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474967"></a>Personal Data Protection Act </p><p>The first <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112072014051">Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)</a> entered into force on 19 July 1996. The act was amended in 2003 to be made fully compliant with the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML">EU Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC)</a>, then <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12909389">amended</a> again in January 2008 and <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/523012019001/consolide">renewed</a> in 2019. The current version of the act can be found <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112072014051">here</a>. </p><p>The PDPA protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons with respect to the processing of their personal data, in accordance with the right of individuals to obtain freely any information that is disseminated for public use.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12909389">2008 version</a> of the act introduced several changes. First, the previous classification of personal data into three groups (non-sensitive personal data, private personal data and sensitive personal data) was replaced by two data categories, namely ‘personal data’ and ‘sensitive personal data’, with the latter being a sub-class under special protection. Second, all processed personal data are protected and registered by chief processors (i.e. controllers) with the <a href="http://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a>, the data protection supervision authority. Finally, the new PDPA extended all general principles applying to the processing of personal data to the processing of the personal identification code (the unique number assigned to every Estonian citizen and resident). </p><p>From 1 January 2015, the Data Protection Inspectorate may submit reports to the Constitutional Committee of the <em>Riigikogu</em> and to the Legal Chancellor concerning significant matters which have an extensive effect or need prompt settlement emerging in the course of supervision over compliance with the act. </p><p class="subtitle">System of Security Measures for Information Systems </p><p>On 1 January 2008, the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/13125331?leiaKehtiv">regulation</a> establishing the system of security measures for information systems used for processing the data contained in State and local government databases and related information assets entered into force. The system consists of the procedure to specify security measures, and the description of organisational, physical and IT security measures to protect data. Importantly, however, the regulation does not apply to the security of information systems processing State secrets.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474968"></a>Interconnection of Base Registries</h3><p class="subtitle">Estonian Base Registries</p><p>In Estonia, the concept of base registries has been phased out and replaced by the basic data principle. Databases are regulated by <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/529032019012/consolide">law</a> (some of them being established by government regulation in secondary laws) as primary sources of basic data, that is unique data. Hence, in Estonia all registries are base registries involving unique data collected in the respective registries.</p><p>Furthermore, the Business Registries of Estonia and Finland were interconnected with the use of the <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/interoperability-services/x-road/">X-Road infrastructure</a>. In February 2019, the Estonian Ministry of Justice and the Finnish Patent and Registration Office signed an agreement in Helsinki, providing that data can be exchanged automatically between the Business Registries of the two countries. No amendment to the national legislation was needed to that purpose.</p><p class="subtitle">Business Registry</p><p>The Business Registry is regulated by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/128122011050?leiaKehtiv">Commercial Code</a> and its <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/504042014002/consolide">amendment</a>, establishing the basic principles of Estonian entrepreneurship and regulating the setting up of companies in the country. In Estonia companies can be registered electronically. </p><p class="subtitle">Population Registry</p><p>The Population Registry is regulated by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/516012014003/consolide">Population Registry Act</a>, providing information regarding its data composition, the procedure for the introduction and maintenance of the Registry, the processing of and access to data, the entry of data on residence, and the supervision over the maintenance of the registry. The purpose of this act is to ensure the collection of the main personal data of the subjects of the Population Registry in a single database to be used by the State and local governments to perform their functions.</p><p class="subtitle">Land Registry</p><p>The Land Registry is regulated by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12769835">Land Registry Act</a>, stipulating provisions with regard to the maintenance procedure, the data content, the entries, the reservation, the documents necessary for registration, the correction of entries, access and extracts, etc.</p><p class="subtitle">Vehicle Registry</p><p>The Vehicle Registry is established by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/compare_original?id=507012014005">General Traffic Act</a>, specifying the content of the Registry, the Ministry governing it, what data it contains and who may access it.</p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">Public Procurement Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/505092017003/consolide/current">Public Procurement Act</a> came into force in May 2007, with the current version transposing the EU Directives on public procurement. The act includes legal provisions enabling the further development of eProcurement (eAuctions, Dynamic Purchasing System, eCatalogues, etc.) to offer better opportunities to reach a fully electronic procurement tendering process. </p><p>Importantly, the <a href="http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/X40095K2.htm">previous version</a> of the Public Procurement Act (October 2000) had already established rules for the eNotification of public tenders through the country’s Public Procurement State Register.</p><p class="subtitle">Act on Amendments to the Accounting Act </p><p>On 20 February 2019, the Estonian Parliament approved a bill providing that the accounting of the State was to fully switch to electronic invoicing. Starting from July 2019, the public sector could only accept eInvoices. In other words, the <a href="https://www.riigikogu.ee/tegevus/eelnoud/eelnou/667615bb-4a13-4a02-812f-550c5dedeef3/Raamatupidamise seaduse muutmise seadus">Act on Amendments to the Accounting Act</a> (795 SE), initiated by the government, made machine-processable invoices mandatory in invoicing with the public sector, aiming to reduce the workload and the time required in invoicing within the public sector. The act also transposed the EU Directive on eInvoicing. An electronic invoice is a machine‑readable document drawn up on the basis of a common standard, sent from one software system to another to avoid entering data by hand.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474969"></a>Domain-specific Legislation</h2><p class="subtitle">Information Society Services Act </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/504112013008/consolide/current">Information Society Services Act</a> was passed on 14 April 2004 and entered into force on 1 May 2004, implementing <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML">Directive 2000/31/EC on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market</a>. More in detail, the act established the requirements pertaining to information society service providers, as well as the organisation of supervision and liability in case of violation of these requirements. </p><p class="subtitle">Simplified Business Income Taxation Act </p><p>On 1 January 2018, the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/522122017001/consolide">Simplified Business Income Taxation Act</a> entered into force, establishing the concept of business account. The business account is aimed at small companies (one-man private limited companies and self-employed persons) in order for them to operate without bureaucracy. In particular, the act enables a natural person to open a business account with 20% of the balance automatically transferred to the Tax and Customs Board. Therefore, the account holders disclose themselves to the Tax and Customs Board and, in return, need not submit annual reports and tax returns.</p><p class="subtitle">Principles for Managing Services and Governing Information </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/507072017004/consolide/current">Principles for Managing Services and Governing Information</a> (a government regulation) entered into force in March 2021, obliging all authorities to ensure:</p><ul><li>Management and quality of direct public services;</li><li>Management and quality of processes;</li><li>Information governance and quality thereof; and</li><li>Every sub-activity of information governance and quality thereof.</li></ul><p>The regulation aims to establish a common view on how to develop, maintain and provide high-quality public services. With this regulation, Estonia adopted a new approach to developing public services: from that moment on, public services must be life event-based and, where possible, proactive. Estonia is currently developing a methodology on how to develop and offer such public services.</p><p>The problem that authorities often face is that they do not have a clear view of their services (as defined in the second article of the regulation). For this reason, the regulation obliges authorities providing public services to maintain an up-to-date list of their own direct public services and of support services provided to other authorities, containing at least significant services. Furthermore, the management of the processes behind the services must have a clear owner. </p><p>The regulation also established a network of coordinators:</p><ul><li>The <a href="https://www.mkm.ee/en">Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications</a> is responsible for the management of direct public services, including determining, sharing and exchanging the information necessary for providing such services;</li><li>The <a href="https://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a> is responsible for organising access to and protection of information; and</li><li>The <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/">Estonian Information System Authority</a> is responsible for the implementation of the requirements applying to the architecture of the State Information System and the key components of the State Information System.</li></ul><p>While executing their tasks, the coordinators have the following functions:</p><ul><li>Planning the main directions for development and the activities supporting such development;</li><li>Issuing guidelines and recommendations;</li><li>Monitoring the implementation of planned activities and the application of guidelines;</li><li>Managing communication;</li><li>Cooperating with other coordinators; and</li><li>Engaging other parties, as necessary.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Regulation on the Cross-Border Exchange of Information Regarding Health Services </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/120112018003">Regulation on the Cross-border Exchange of Information regarding Health Services</a> came into force in November 2018, aiming to enable people abroad to have better access to medical care and medicines thanks to the electronic exchange of prescription data between countries. Estonia and Finland became the first two countries in Europe to exchange medicine prescription data. Since January 2019, the first EU patients have been able to use digital prescriptions issued by their home doctor when visiting a pharmacy in another EU country: Finnish patients are now able to go to a pharmacy in Estonia and retrieve medicines prescribed electronically by their doctor in Finland. The initiative applies to all ePrescriptions in Finland and to the Estonian pharmacies that have signed the agreement. The novelty of this initiative is that the ePrescriptions are visible electronically to participating pharmacists in the receiving country via the new eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure, without the patient having to provide a written prescription.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474971"></a>Innovative Technologies </h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Big Data </h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud Computing</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>GovTech</h3><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><p><img src="img/32-508.png" alt="32-508.png" /></p><p>4</p><p>Digital Public Administration Infrastructure </p><h1><a id="_Toc140672424"></a>Digital Public Administration Infrastructure </h1><h2>Platforms and Applications</h2><h3>National Platforms and Applications</h3><p class="subtitle">eesti.ee: eGovernment Portal</p><p><a href="https://www.eesti.ee/eng">Estonia’s eGovernment Portal</a> was first launched in March 2003 on the basis of the eCitizen project initiated in 2002 and has been constantly renewed since then.

More in detail, EEBone is a government-wide backbone network connecting more than 20 000 computers from all government offices across the country, and providing secure access to the internet and the government’s intranet. </p><p>The network was launched in October 1998, and was developed based on ASONet, the backbone network elaborated by the Border Guard Administration, the Customs Board and the Police Board in 1993. The network currently provides approximately 50% of all administrative services to the various associations. The use of the backbone network is financed centrally from the State budget and is free of charge for subscribed clients.

In particular, the use of X-tee is the mandatory solution for data exchange between public sector information systems. </p><p>Initially developed as an environment facilitating the formulation of queries to different databases in a standardised way, the system allows officials, as well as legal and natural entities, to search data from national databases over the internet, within the limits of their authority, using a unified user interface.</p><p>In addition, the system has been further developed to enable the creation of eServices capable of simultaneously using data stored in different databases. As a result, several extensions have been developed for the X-tee system, such as writing operations in databases, transmitting huge datasets between information systems, performing successive data search operations in different data sheets and providing services via web portals.</p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-533.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" />Anonymiser</p><p>At the end of 2022, an application for the anonymisation of personal data was released, aiming at increasing security in the training of bureaucratic contacts. The Data Anonymiser will identify personal identifiers such as names, IDs and locations of individuals from text, which it will be able to replace with another value of the same entity class (e.g. Tallinn will be replaced with Tartu).</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/buerokratt/Data-Anonymizer">application</a> is intended to be used both in Bürokratt and in applications and information systems of other institutions tasked with the processing or storing of personal data.</p><p>The Anonymiser contributes to mitigating the risk associated with the processing of personal data and is compliant with ICSMS regulations. The application has the potential to be used with both anonymisation and pseudonymisation methods, depending on the user's needs. Interfaced customers can use the application on the basis of the NER corpora developed by the University of Tartu, as well as to further train the corpora with institution-specific datasets.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic ID Card</p><p>Estonia started issuing <a href="http://www.id.ee/?lang=en">national eID cards</a> in January 2002. The card, fulfilling the requirements of Estonia’s Digital Signatures Act, now replaced by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/527102016001/consolide">Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act</a>, is mandatory for all Estonian citizens and residing foreigners over 15 years of age. The eID card is meant to be the primary document for identifying citizens and residents, and is used for all activities – governmental or private. In particular, the <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/">eID card</a> can be used to vote electronically (since 2005), create a business, verify banking transactions and access medical history (since 2010), and can work as a virtual ticket. Furthermore, the eID card is a valid travel document within the EU. Since 1 January 2007, the card issued by the Citizenship and Migration Board (CMB) has become valid for five years (instead of ten years previously). In January 2020, more than 1.3 million people in Estonia (almost 98% of inhabitants) had eID cards. </p><p>In addition to being a physical identification document, the card features advanced electronic functions facilitating secure authentication and providing a legally binding digital signature for public and private online services. An electronic processor chip contains a personal data file, a certificate for authentication, a certificate for digital signature and the associated private keys, protected with PIN codes. The certificates contain only the holder’s name and personal code (national ID code). </p><p class="subtitle">Mobile-ID</p><p>The <a href="http://id.ee/?lang=en&amp;id=36881">mobile-ID</a> is the ID card-based identity verification and digital signature solution for users of mobile phones in Estonia. The mobile phone, based on a standardised SIM application, acts as a secure signing device. Thus, similarly to the eID card, the mobile-ID enables authentication and digital signing of documents, bearing the same legal value. The user’s certificates are maintained on the telecom operator’s SIM card and require the user to enter a PIN code to be used.</p><p class="subtitle">Smart-ID</p><p>As an alternative to the mobile-ID, Estonia has a new private sector-offered solution for secure authentication, called <a href="https://www.smart-id.com/">smart-ID</a>. The smart-ID can be used to log in to eServices, to use the online banking and to sign documents. Signatures given with the smart-ID are legally binding and recognised in all EU States, and have the same legal effect as handwritten signatures.  </p><p class="subtitle">ePassport</p><p>To comply with <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R2252:EN:HTML">Regulation 2252/2004/EC on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States</a>, the systems developed by the CMB have undergone considerable changes that have been implemented step-by-step. Changes in the organisation of the work and the supporting systems of the CMB are planned at both customer service and document issuance system level. The <a href="https://www2.politsei.ee/et/nouanded/dokumentide-naidised/eesti-kodaniku-pass/eesti-kodaniku-pass-2007-2014.dot">first biometric passports</a> containing the holder’s biometric data were delivered on 22 May 2007. </p><p class="subtitle">Dokobit Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://www.dokobit.com/e-residency">Dokobit</a> portal is available for numerous countries, including Estonian eID-card, and Estonian, Icelandic and Lithuanian mobile-ID users. In addition, users can log in to the portal using the smart-ID from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The portal allows for digital signatures, verification of the validity of digital signatures, and documents to be forwarded to and received from other users of the portal.</p><p>The Dokobit portal provides a quick and easy way to raise the security of any web service to meet the highest demands, making it possible to carry out authentication based on strong authentication devices from different vendors and providing service providers with the opportunity to enter legal signatures on any created data within their service. That way, the portal provides long-term validity and proof of action in courts across the EU. Finally, the portal enables to gather digital signatures for documents that need to be signed by multiple parties, including entrepreneurs, government officials and individuals.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Public Procurement Registry</p><p>The <a href="https://riigihanked.riik.ee/rhr-web/#/">Public Procurement Registry</a> offers an innovative, free, self-service working environment for buyers (i.e. contracting authorities) to organise and tenderers (i.e. economic operators) to participate in public procurements. Anyone can freely browse published procurements, notices and contract information, and review the decisions of the Committee that decides the outcome of the procurement. The Public Procurement Registry is administered by the Ministry of Finance.</p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing in Estonia</p><p>The <a href="https://www.omniva.ee/index.php?article_id=232&amp;page=580&amp;action=article">implementation of eInvoices</a> in Estonia began in 2014. According to the <a href="https://www.rahandusministeerium.ee/et/riigihaldus/e-arved">amendments to the Accounting Act</a> introduced in 2019, government authorities can only accept eInvoices, which is in line with the Once-Only principle, and significantly reduces the time and labour invested into processing invoices. Private sector operators can utilise various providers to send eInvoices to the government or to other operators. </p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">TARGET Instant Payment Settlement</p><p>Since November 2018, commercial banks operating in Estonia have been able to join the <a href="https://www.eestipank.ee/en/press/new-tips-system-will-make-instant-payments-more-affordable-smaller-banks-30112018">TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS)</a> through Eesti Pank (Bank of Estonia).

The DHX relies on <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/state-information-system/x-tee.html">X-Road</a> version 6 as transport-level infrastructure. </p><p>The automatic document exchange in the Estonian public sector began in 2006. Due to an irregular internet connection, sending documents from one document management system to another was challenging. For this reason, the State created a central solution, i.e. the Document Exchange Centre, where documents would be temporarily stored in such situations. The Document Exchange Centre was used by all Ministries and agencies in their area of government, county governments, agencies and inspectorates, but also by most of the local governments and educational establishments, and other institutions of the public sector. In 2009, the European Consortium for Electronic State Awards recognised the Document Exchange Centre as a good service and strategic initiative.</p><p>The transition to the new means of document exchange began in 2017, with the Document Exchange Centre closed at the end of 2018 and the new distributed solution for the exchange of documents, the DHX, implemented at the beginning of 2019. The new protocol enables documents to be transported between agencies directly from sender to receiver. </p><p class="subtitle"><a href="https://ee.ekool.eu/index_en.html">eKool</a> Web Application</p><p><a href="https://ee.ekool.eu/index_en.html">eKool</a> is a simple web application that connects all education stakeholders in an easy way over the internet, helping them to collaborate and organise their teaching/learning related information. eKool is available either as a direct web service for end users or as a hosted white-label service for distributing/promoting partners.</p><p class="subtitle">Personal Data Usage Monitor</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/e-gov/AJ/blob/master/preliminary/Overview.md">Personal Data Usage Monitor</a> is a set of four micro service-style applications that, when combined with each other and attached to X-tee, provide citizens with a comprehensive view of how their personal data have been used by the government.</p><p class="subtitle">Select IT</p><p><a href="http://www.vali-it.ee/">Select IT</a> is a pilot adult retraining programme that was launched in 2017.

digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad. In order to do so, Your Europe offers information on basic rights under EU law, but also on how these rights are implemented in each individual country (where information has been provided by the national authorities). Free email or telephone contact with EU assistance services, to get more personalised or detailed help and advice is also available.</p><p>Please note that, in most cases, the EU rights described in Your Europe apply to all EU member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, and sometimes to Switzerland. Information on Your Europe is provided by the relevant departments of the European Commission and complemented by content provided by the authorities of every country it covers.

Indeed, enhanced interoperability will be necessary to unlock the potential of data use and reuse for improved public services, to enable cross-border collaboration, and to support the sector-specific policy goals set by the Commission for the future.</p><p>Interoperable Europe will lead the process of achieving these goals and creating a reinforced interoperability policy that will work for everyone.
