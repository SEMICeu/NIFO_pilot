It aims to provide a vision for the country to prosper as a digitally enabled nation in all sectors of society.</p><p>The core principles underpinning the implementation of the Digital Malta vision are:</p><ul><li>Ensuring all citizens are offered the possibility to benefit from ICT as a fundamental right.</li><li>Advocating proactive leadership and delivering programmes that meet needs.</li><li>Supporting national priorities in line with Government policy, the National Reform Programme and EU obligations.</li><li>Engaging the private sector as an important player in the delivery of the Strategy.</li><li>Optimising value and accountability.</li><li>Ensuring collaboration between stakeholders to make the best use of national strategic information assets, encourage synergies and minimise fragmentation.</li><li>Encouraging a more environmentally friendly society through greener procurement, implementation and application of ICT.</li><li>Supporting and enabling Research and Innovation (R&amp;I) in identified areas of strength, capability and centres of excellence (smart specialisation).</li><li>Adopting an open and experimental mind-set, capitalising on lessons learned from success stories and respecting best practices and international standards.</li><li>Maximising opportunities from multiple funding sources, including European and international funding programmes and the private sector.</li></ul><p>Building on past and present successes, the strategy will, above all, focus on the challenges needed to address the gaps towards becoming a universally digitised society. From the citizen’s perspective this will translate in enhancing their digital capability to better and more efficiently access healthcare and social services, connect the elderly and socially excluded, improve education for all, and create higher-quality jobs. From an economic perspective digital competence and specialist ICT skills need to be widened, and national policy and strategies adjusted, to strengthen Malta's workforce and make its businesses more innovative and competitive.</p><p>Within this context, the strategy outlines three strategic themes: </p><ul><li>Digital Citizen; </li><li>Digital Business; and</li><li>Digital Government. </li></ul><p>The above themes are supported by three strategic enablers:</p><ul><li>Regulation and Legislation; </li><li>Infrastructure; and</li><li>Human Capital. </li></ul><p>In support of this transformation, the goals are that ICT becomes the underlying infrastructure and driver behind every economic activity. ICT should make public administration more responsive, use of natural resources more sustainable, the legal and regulatory environment more business-friendly, and the SME and NGO communities more connected. Above all ICT should become an empowering tool for young entrepreneurs and a major source of impetus for the creation of more jobs and growth by Malta's key and emerging economic sectors.</p><p>The Parliamentary Secretariate responsible for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation within the Office of the Prime Minister is responsible for the implementation of a Digital Economy for Malta, and has the overall governance of the eGovernment vision, strategy and associated programmes. The Parliamentary Secretariate provides leadership and has ultimate responsibility for the successful delivery of the ICT programme. </p><p>The implementation of a Digital Economy requires the involvement and collaboration of various key players and entities. Amongst these, the Malta Communications Authority (MCA) and the Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) are considered the main actors.</p><p class="subtitle">Mapping Tomorrow – A Strategic Plan for the Digital Transformation of the Public Administration (2019-2021)</p><p><a href="https://publicservice.gov.mt/en/Documents/MappingTomorrow_StrategicPlan2019.pdf">Mapping Tomorrow</a> is a strategic plan for the Public Administration. The Public Administration will enter a new era of further simplification of public services to reduce the administrative burden on its clients and to have client-centred public services through digital transformation. The document sets a clear vision with well-articulated goals and an ambitious implementation plan.</p><p>Government’s vision aspires to take public services to the next level of improvement through the adoption of digital technologies. The vision is to have: A Public Administration Empowered by Digital Transformation.</p><p>This Plan does not exist in isolation but builds on previous achievements such as the drive to provide services which are available 24x7. Based on past achievements, this Strategic Plan sets three goals which build upon each other and form a continuum of improvement in service delivery.</p><p>Goals:</p><p>Take-Up;</p><p>Once-Only; and</p><p>Service of Excellence.</p><p>The first goal links to previous strategies and aims to bring simplified services which are digital end-to-end to increase take-up.</p><p>Once-only is the core goal, aiming at internal sharing and re-use of data and information that has been previously provided by a citizen or organisation. The aim is to stop asking for information which already exists within Government.</p><p>The third goal brings public services in line with social trends and demands, and to the quality levels expected by citizens and businesses. It looks at the adoption of emerging technologies such as AI to bring public services that are personalised, user-friendly and timely. The goal is to exceed client expectations.</p><p>The goals are ambitious and require a co-ordinated and collective approach from all Ministries. Stakeholders need to embrace a number of key-enabling concepts, principles, and technologies that are designed to bring the whole of Government together.</p><p>Specific concepts that are at heart of this Strategic Plan: </p><p>Client-Centricity;</p><p>One Government;</p><p>Sharing and Re-use;</p><p>End-to-End Services;</p><p>Digital by Default; and</p><p>Process Re-engineering.</p><p>Generic Principles which are to be adopted throughout this digital transformation:</p><p>Trust;</p><p>Stronger Awareness;</p><p>Security and Privacy;</p><p>Agility and Continuous Improvement;</p><p>Accessibility;</p><p>Availability;</p><p>Ongoing Investment and Celebrating Success; and</p><p>Interoperability and Cross-Border.</p><p>Adoption of Emerging Technologies in order to meet and exceed clients’ expectations:</p><ul><li>AI;</li><li>Internet of Things;</li></ul><p>Distributed Ledger Technologies;</p><p>Business Intelligence and Analytics; and</p><p>Immersive Technologies.</p><p>The implementation plan is based on four strategic pillars which bring different elements of the Public Administration together so that work can be co-ordinated with clear authority and responsibility. </p><p><strong>Pillar 1: A Client-Centric Public Administration </strong></p><p>A number of major milestones to strengthen the relationship which has been built between Government and its clients, bringing the latter closer to the design of digital services, including also those who are not so tech-savvy.</p><p><strong>Pillar 2: Sector Specific Programmes</strong></p><p>Services that are specific to their sectors, without detracting from the notion that for clients the Public Administration is a whole entity. </p><p><strong>Pillar 3: Internal Solutions for the Public Administration</strong></p><p>Empowering employees and modernising internal (user and corporate) solutions are equally important. The Plan aims to provide the Public Administration with the right tools and corporate solutions for use across Government.</p><p><strong>Pillar 4: Technological Platforms and Solutions</strong></p><p>Digital transformation requires a technological platform to enable the implementation of solutions. The current infrastructure will be upgraded with avant-garde technologies, giving more autonomy to Ministries in a secure environment. </p><p><strong>Governance and Implementation </strong></p><p>The Plan also identifies a number of governance elements for successful implementation. The advocacy of Critical Success Factors calls for a re-engineering exercise to adopt a horizontal approach; it mandates careful investment in both human capital and systems and technologies; and while it sets clear governing structures it invites further action to keep plan current. </p><p class="subtitle">Mobile Government Strategy 2017 – 2018</p><p>Citizens and businesses regularly came into contact with public services at various instances of their daily lives. More convenient access to public services was intended to help individuals, families and businesses to take better care of their personal, professional and commercial interests. In these circumstances, the Government aimed to pursue new and innovative ways of providing its services. Another government goal was to provide public offices with more modern and flexible means of providing personalised and value-added services to citizens and businesses, at the time and place where these services are needed. This was expected to transform the public sector into one that is more modern, agile and capable of changing its procedures as necessary to be more effective and less bureaucratic. Within this context, the Office of the Prime Minister launched its <a href="https://publicservice.gov.mt/en/Documents/Mobile_Government_Strategy_2017-2018.pdf">Government mServices Strategy</a> (2017-2018), and outlined the approach being adopted to introduce public services through mobile devices, referred to as mServices.</p><p>Alongside public services already offered via the eGovernment programme, the introduction of mServices was intended to help achieve the Government’s goal of bringing public services closer to citizens on a 24/7 basis. Therefore, the vision of the Government mServices initiative was “Access to 24/7 Public Services from Anywhere". </p><p>The Strategy was based upon 11 principles:</p><ol><li>Enabling mobility through the introduction of mServices;</li><li>Appropriate service channels, particularly the notion of mobile first;</li><li>Citizen-centricity when designing and implementing mServices;</li><li>Simplification of processes when introducing mServices;</li><li>Personalisation of mServices;</li><li>User experience shall be seamless across multiple service channels;</li><li>Collaboration between public entities to share data already residing within the Public Administration and achieve a once-only request for data from citizens and businesses;</li><li>Agility and timeliness in introducing the right mServices, as and when needed;</li><li>Accessibility of mServices, making them easy to discover and use;</li><li>Awareness and training through publicity campaigns and online training to guide and assist stakeholders;</li><li>Building trust in mServices through the application of appropriate security measures.</li></ol><p>It was generally possible to classify mServices into one or more of the four categories: mCommunications dealt with two-way communication of Government with citizens and businesses; mTransactions handled transactional services, including payments that may require user identification; mDemocracy further increased citizen participation in political decision-making, while mAdministration introduced mobile-based tools for public officers to increase their mobility and facilitate personalised public services on location.</p><p>November 2018 marked the final phase of this strategy. Whilst there were no plans for a new strategy focusing specifically on mobile initiatives, the programme continued to work in phases, with the aim of improving and creating new user-centric Government services tapping on new and emerging technologies.</p><p>At a <a href="https://publicservice.gov.mt/en/Pages/News/2018/20180419_mServices.aspx">press conference</a> on 19 April 2018, the Principal Permanent Secretary announced the launch of 13 new mobile apps and 10 responsive websites, as well as the soft launch of an additional 10 websites. It followed an earlier event that saw the launch of the first 21 mobile apps for Government services (mServices) in 2017, as part of the implementation of the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/en/News/Documents/MOB STRATEGY SML.PDF">Mobile Government Strategy 2017-2018</a>. Additionally, a communication by the Principal Permanent Secretary in November 2018 announced the addition of a further 26 new mServices which related to education, agriculture, voluntary organisations, tax, social security, judicial and law enforcement services, and which were accessed by around 90 000 online users per month.  </p><p class="subtitle">CONvErGE Project </p><p>In 2017, the Prime Minister officially launched the <a href="https://www.mita.gov.mt/en/News/Pages/2017/CONvErGE-€40-million-investment-to-strenghten-Government’s-ICT-systems.aspx">CONvErGE Project</a> with an investment of EUR 40 million, of which EUR 28.5 million were co-financed by the EU as part of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/funding/erdf/">ERDF 2014-2020</a>. Through this project, the government continued to strengthen public services through the development of its ICT systems. The aim was to create a number of new services that provided more benefits to citizens and businesses. These funds enabled the development of new systems for various sectors, namely the health, social services, justice, public finance, tourism, emergency systems and business sectors. Apart from the development of new systems, the funds were used to strengthen the government’s IT infrastructure. </p><p>Through this <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/en/ict-features/Pages/2017/CONvErGE-â-A-major-investment-enabling-Connected-eGovernment.aspx">project</a>, the Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) supported Ministries in their implementation of new eService applications that included:</p><ul><li>A new accounting system for government; </li><li>A new electronic system for customs; </li><li>A national health infrastructure known as eHealth; </li><li>A digital platform for the tourism sector; </li><li>A new system for the management of activity related to national disasters;</li><li>New systems for Maltese laws, the legal profession and notarial archives; </li><li>An electronic system for social services; and</li><li>A project analysing the need for and development of a portal for businesses.<a id="_Toc1474952"></a></li></ul><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a href="https://www.gov.mt/">Gov.mt</a></p><p>The national portal <a href="https://www.gov.mt/">Gov.mt</a> is the central source for all citizen services and governmental information, across the board, whilst businessfirst.com.mt and <a href="https://servizz.gov.mt/">servizz.gov</a>.mt are the national portals for businesses and citizens respectively.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle">National Identity Management System (NIDMS) </p><p>The National Identity Management System (NIDMS) provides the functionality necessary to consolidate eID Account information and seamlessly associate them with the eID, eRP and ePassport lifecycle.

The Strategy served as a framework to protect information systems, networks and information on the internet, together with the respective users of the services that they provide; namely Government, the private sector and civil society. The strategy was one of the action items proposed by <a href="https://mitacms.gov.mt/en/Documents/ICT Strategy/Digital Malta 2014 - 2020.pdf">Digital Malta</a> – National Digital Strategy for the years 2014-2020. The key principles of the National Cyber Security Strategy aimed to reflect the various facets of cyber security and the essential underlying complex nature of cyber space. Under the direction of the National Cyber Security Strategy Steering Committee, MITA launched a campaign focusing on all strata of civil society to instil a culture towards cyber security awareness. The targets audience included the general public, SMEs, public sector, students and IT professionals. To achieve this, a variety of communication mediums were used, mainly social media, traditional media such as television, radio and news portals, together with a dedicated website. Activities ranged from drama via TV and theatres, training, surveys, focus groups, workshops, competitions and awards. </p><p>With regards to cybersecurity within the public sector, MITA launched an Information Security Policy that was articulated, published and communicated. This was based on ISO27001 Information Security International Standard, and that was applicable to everyone within the Public Sector. As part of this Framework, MITA started scanning all Government websites that utilised MITA’s infrastructure for the identification of vulnerabilities and subsequent rectification by the respective owners. This governance framework was extended to cover the protection of environments that migrated or were newly commissioned on MITA’s new Hybrid Cloud Enabling Infrastructure. This was an innovative project which re-designed the way MITA sought to provide assurance to its clients that the infrastructure on which Government data resided was adequately safeguarded from the ever-increasing threats defining today’s cyber space. MITA heavily invested in cutting edge technology to provide it and its clients with the ability to continuously scan for vulnerabilities and obtain real-time visibility on the operational health and security posture of environments hosted on this platform. Information Security included three main dimensions: confidentiality, availability and integrity, and involved the application and management of appropriate security measures for a wide range of threats, with the aim of ensuring sustained business success and continuity, and minimising impacts of information security incidents. (Reference <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/66435.html">ISO/IEC 27000</a>). Additionally, MITA invested in tools to aid in the detection and prevention of cyber security incidents, including adequate training of its employees throughout the organisation, and collaboration with other Governmental Departments to ensure a centralised and cohesive approach in this domain.</p><p>The full version of the Information Security Policy can be accessed <a href="https://www.mita.gov.mt/en/Security/Documents/IMS-POL-InfoSec-v9.0.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>Messages to the public pertaining to cybersecurity are channelled through Malta’s Cyber Security <a href="https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/">page</a>, stemming from a national cyber security strategy that the Government had endorsed MITA to <a href="https://www.mita.gov.mt/en/cybersecuritygreenpaper/Pages/National-Cybersecurity.aspx">draft</a>, subsequently followed by the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/en/Documents/MITA STRATEGY 2018-2020.pdf">Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) 2018-2020 Strategy</a>. </p><p class="subtitle">Launch of the National Cyber Security Awareness and Education Campaign</p><p>On 16 October 2018, the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation, in the presence of the Minister for National Security and Home Affairs, launched the <a href="https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/resource_articles/launch-of-a-national-cyber-security-awareness-and-educational-campaign/">National Cyber Security Awareness and Education Campaign</a>. As stated, the Campaign which was one of the key goals of the National Cyber Security Strategy published in 2016, was based on Government’s belief in the need for all Maltese society to be fully aware of cyber risks and the security measures to be taken. The Campaign targeted the general public, the private sector as well as the public sector - as the largest holder of critical and sensitive information - through practical training and promotional initiatives. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle">Registry of Base Registers</p><p>The <a href="https://open.data.gov.mt/registers.html?type=footer">Register of Registers</a> is a comprehensive list of legally based official lists and registers which includes all the national registers and also a section which comprises the Foundation Data Layer, namely the main Base Registers for Person, Location (Address) and Organisation, and also a set of Administrative Registers which reflect the Public Organisations and the organisational structures of the Government of Malta and also the list of Public Services.</p><p>The quality and governance aspects of the Master Data is first and foremost regulated through a new raft of specific legal notices and new subsidiary legislation under the Cap 546 of the Laws of Malta (PSI Directive transposition) with the intention to give legal basis to the data sharing and re-use both within the public administration and also beyond.

Whilst ensuring that society at large develops the right competence and capability to secure a better future, the need to revisit the effectiveness of strategies leading to acquisition digital skills by individuals, society and Malta as a nation state is clear. This <a href="https://eskills.org.mt/en/nationaleskillsstrategy/Documents/National_eSkills_strategy.pdf">Strategy</a> aims to complement initiatives at both the local and EU level to address the need for existing and new digital skills that shall be required in nearly all jobs in the medium term. The digital market will completely transform several business models that we are accustomed to. This is expected to bring major changes within the labour market in a relatively short time. Despite general positive developments in the digital literacy, the need for a continued effort to narrow the digital gap further is key to the <a href="https://eskills.org.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx">Malta eSkills Foundation</a>.</p><p>The digital skills strategy is formed of twelve main recommendation areas. The recommendations aim to support the business needs development of the Foundation to match the rapid pace of change led by market needs. The Strategy also aims to develop a number of measures to support a decision-making process that is more evidence based. In addition, the Strategy put forward several specific recommendations to address a number of current developing market trends identified as part of the fieldwork done over the past year. </p><p class="subtitle">Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) Strategy (2018-2020)</p><p>The new MITA <a href="http://mita.gov.mt/en/Documents/MITA STRATEGY 2018-2020.pdf">Strategy</a> provided the purpose, focus and direction that the Agency adopted from 2018-2020. for the upcoming three years. It set out a vision for MITA to be “the digital driver for the transformation of Government.” With the view that transformation requires more than digital solutions, this vision placed the Agency in a position to serve as the “digital driver” to help the Public Administration to transform through the digitalisation of public services.</p><p>The Strategy introduced four corporate drivers which explained changes in the modus operandi of the organisation, and which were required to achieve the desired states set for 2020. The Agency needed to transform itself to innovate in existing core business areas and introduce new services. It had to adopt an innovative approach in which employees were given the opportunities to enhance their knowledge, apply new ideas and continuously learn and research on the application of new technologies. This enabled the Agency to spearhead the digitalisation of Public Services through a direct contribution in ICT infrastructure, solutions and outreach activities. The agency intends to work in tandem with Ministry CIOs to safeguard Government digital assets, prioritise, and align digital strategies to help Government achieve its strategic goals. </p><p>The Strategy established a clear direction with 10 desired states where the organisation aimed to be by the end of 2020, with 32 corresponding actions to lead MITA from where it was to where it wanted to be. These desired states covered the necessary focus which the Agency must embrace and tackle; ICT direction, application of new technologies, security, digital transformation, community engagement, cybersecurity, operational stability and effectiveness, focus on core, client-centric service provision and continuous human resource development. Through these desired states, the Agency aimed to go through the necessary internal changes, improve collaboration across government and bring about a holistic approach to achieve its vision of becoming the digital driver for the transformation of Government. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a><a id="_Hlk8982808"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">National ICT Interoperability Framework (NIF)</p><p>Malta has acknowledged the importance of interoperability and is working decisively towards making its public services interoperable.

The Directive mandated Central Government, Government entities and Local Councils to receive and process invoices electronically. Whilst Central Government was mandated to receive and process eInvoices by April 2019, other Government entities and Local Councils were mandated to comply with the Directive by April 2020. </p><p>As part of the process, the <a href="https://mfin.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Ministry for Finance</a> (MFIN), embarked on various local and EU participating initiatives.

The Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS) was a product of the European core invoice data model enlisting country specific requirements of country data within the model. The adoption of the PEPPOL CIUS guaranteed a high degree of interoperability since several Member States adopted CIUS or based their local CIUS on PEPPOL. It means that the Government incorporated the PEPPOL CIUS in its systems and was able to receive eInvoices through the PEPPOL eDelivery network. Joining OpenPEPPOL was an important part of Malta’s strategy to support compliance with the European eInvoicing Directive (2014/55/EU), making it easier for businesses to engage with Government online.  </p><p>The Maltese Government promoted the adoption of eInvoicing in its <a href="https://digitalmalta.org.mt/en/Documents/Digital Malta 2014 - 2020.pdf">Digital Malta National Strategy 2014-2020</a>.

The MDIA acts as a conduit for the development of new economic sectors, whilst working in tandem to support other National Competent Authorities such as the MFSA and the MGA, from a technological perspective.</p><p>The MDIA’s regulatory regime, the Innovative Technology Arrangements and Services (ITAS) Act, dressed up the technology making sure it meets criteria for safe use and an element of accountability. The ITAS Act facilitated the regulatory framework required for the MDIA to operate, in terms of review and assessment of requirements of legality, integrity, transparency, compliance and accountability of the related technology arrangements.</p><p>The MDIA published a set of guidelines after holding numerous meetings with businesses, technologists, policy makers and a multitude of different professionals which came into force on 1 November 2018. This was the general course of action which the MDIA also planned to take in the future for other initiatives in order to accommodate the ever-increasing pace at which technology is updated and developed. To maintain an overall consistent level of effectiveness, this required the adoption of a mindset which was both open to change when required and was quick to react when such a change was needed. It was for this reason that the MDIA had a unit with the main aim of keeping an eye on emerging technologies and developments which may very often prompt the need to update relevant guidelines.</p><p>The MDIA was a key player in establishing Malta as the Blockchain Island, the first jurisdiction to come up with a regulatory framework that made it possible to certify innovative technology. The MDIA set new technological standards that were not available anywhere and were aimed at instigating innovation.</p><p>The MDIA issued the accreditation of the first Systems Auditors (SAs) which applied for registration on 3 April 2019. The accreditation of SAs served as a seal of approval that certified they were fit and proper, and had the necessary technical skills, aptitude, capability as well as experience, to handle systems audits related to Innovative Technology Arrangements (ITAs).</p><p>A SA is a service provider under the ITAS Act. Accredited Systems Auditors carry out system reviews and come up with an opinion on the management, security and functional correctness of ITAs. The SAs abide by the guidelines and control objectives published by the MDIA. These objectives are designed with the aim to assist the SA through an Audit Framework for ITAs. Furthermore, they build upon five key principles: security, processing integrity, availability, confidentiality and protection of personal data. It is through such certification by MDIA, which although not mandatory on the applicant, that a new service to operators is being provided, giving them the additional peace of mind.</p><p>The opinion of the Systems Auditors is key for the MDIA to issue certification to ITAs. ITA Applicants may approach the MDIA, on a voluntary basis, to certify their products to promote them to the world that they are fit for purpose and meeting the standards of the MDIA. Through certification the Authority aims to foster safer usage and protect users of innovative technology and thus more adoption, whilst at the same time increasing the prospects for investment in innovative technology and therefore, creating solid opportunity.</p><p>Further details on the established MDIA can be found on <a href="https://mdia.gov.mt/">https://mdia.gov.mt/</a> .

In this regard, the Government of Malta, through the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/en/Pages/MITAHome.aspx">Malta Information Technology Agency</a> (MITA) has continued to invest heavily in this sector. This was done to continue to provide the best infrastructure for the hosting of the Government’s public facing portals. A new portal hosting platform was launched in 2019. The new platform is based on Microsoft SharePoint 2016 and aims to offer an out-of-the-box solution to the Government for the address of non-standard branded sites.</p><p>The Government also fully upgraded the Gov.mt portal with a new brand. This site will soon be migrated to the newly set up infrastructure described referred to before. The Government portal, <a href="file:///C:\Users\piccm001\Downloads\www.gov.mt">www.gov.mt</a>, is an institutional site providing comprehensive and meaningful information on Government ministries, policies, services. The upgrade to the gov.mt portal triggered an exercise to consolidate the entry point for all electronic forms onto the <a href="http://www.servizz.gov.mt">Servizz.Gov</a> portal. Through the Servizz.Gov portal, citizens can also submit queries, suggestions and complaints to public entities regarding the services they offer, report excessive bureaucracy and request information.</p><p>Traditionally the gov.mt portal served as an entry point for service delivery, i.e. service directory. Through this change, the entry point for all government service delivery has now been consolidated under the servizz.gov.mt portal. The latter was enacted as the one-stop shop for public interfacing services, and for which it won the Service Design Award at the Service Design Global Conference in 2017. Now, the Government of Malta has consolidated all its public facing services into one portal categorised under specific Super Sectors, Sectors and Functions. This categorisation enables the public to pinpoint the required electronic service with ease, thus reducing the time for a person to avail of a service.</p><p>This also means that the former eForm landing pages were also consolidated within the Servizz.Gov portal in a homogenous and consistent manner. The latter portal would in turn call the eForms platform to load the various services that the public would require. The forms on the eForms platform enable information to be collected once at source and are subsequently electronically distributed to the respective Government entities. The eForms platform is also integrated with other electronic services, namely the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/en/eGov/DevelopmentToolkit/eGovServicestoolkit/Pages/Devolopers' Toolkit - Electronic Payments.aspx">Government Payment Gateway</a> (GPG), electronic identity (eID), <a href="https://www.mita.gov.mt/en/eGov/DevelopmentToolkit/eGovServicestoolkit/Pages/Development-Toolkit-Notification-Services_b.aspx">SMS notifications</a> and Microsoft Exchange for email notifications.</p><p class="subtitle">www.gov.mt Portal</p><p>The Government of Malta's <a href="http://www.gov.mt/">portal</a> is an institutional site providing comprehensive and meaningful information on Government ministries, policies and services. Government services and information are structured according to the needs of specific citizen groups/events. An A to Z list of Government websites can be accessed through the portal. In late 2018, the gov.mt website and the sub site doi.gov.mt, were reorganised and relaunched with a new brand. Since the primary objective of the gov.mt website is to be the Government of Malta primary facing website to the world, the role of gov.mt being the central website for Public Administration services was taken over by servizz.gov.mt.</p><p class="subtitle"><a href="http://servizz.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Servizz.Gov</a>.mt website</p><p><a href="http://servizz.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Servizz.Gov</a> Agency is the Government’s One Stop Shop for the general public, and www.servizz.gov.mt is now the central website for all Public Administration services. Through this website, citizens can look up services categorised under 12 super sectors. The scope of establishing such sectors was to simplify the categorisation of services, since now they are linked to a sector which is not bound to change, rather than to a specific Ministry which is highly subjective to change. The website also offers the possibility for citizens to report complaints and excessive bureaucracy, offer suggestions and request information.

The Intranet for the Public Service is available to all government department/entities and their employees. Intra.gov.mt, through a collaboration site, provides any participating government department/entity the facility to share between each other activities such as document management and workflows that address the department’s/entity’s internal business requirements.

Its aim was to alert the general public about job opportunities related to areas of their interest within the Public Administration.   </p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk507071848"></a>Next Generation Access (NGNs)</p><p>Malta is the European leader in NGA broadband access as confirmed through European DESI reports. The Malta Communications Authority plays an important role in facilitating and nurturing a healthy and competitive business environment and infrastructure-based competition.</p><p class="subtitle"><a href="https://www.mita.gov.mt/MediaCenter/PDFs/1_CIMU_P_0011_Connectivity_to_MAGNET.pdf">MAGNET</a></p><p><a href="https://www.mita.gov.mt/MediaCenter/PDFs/1_CIMU_P_0011_Connectivity_to_MAGNET.pdf">MAGNET</a> was implemented in 1995 as the Maltese Government Network that connects all Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies, as well as Local Councils, Police Stations, Libraries, Hospitals, Health Centres, Social Services offices and Embassies. This network enabled the Government to proliferate IT and information society applications such as email, the Internet, and corporate applications like the Common Database (CdB) and the Departmental Accounting System (DAS), to help facilitate and improve the efficiency of the Public Service. The availability of this network enabled the Government to launch its eGovernment services. A new network, 'MAGNET II', was launched in July 2005 and partly replaced MAGNET. This new state-of-the-art network presented a number of benefits for users compared with its predecessor. In particular, MAGNET II provided enhanced bandwidth per site, offered better reliability through strict service level agreements (SLAs), guaranteed 99.8% minimum site availability and was fully secure through extensive encryption.</p><p>In 2015, the MAGNET III was launched to provide cost effective connectivity services to Government. By the end of 2016, all MAGNET II sites migrated to the MAGNET III infrastructure. Whilst retaining the strongholds of the MAGNET II, the MAGNET III infrastructure offered flexible bandwidths in accordance to client business needs. Another major benefit of MAGNET III was the network’s ability to transport Voice over IP (VoIP) calls efficiently and effectively between all connected organisations. A Government-wide intranet became available to all entities connected to the network. Malta Public Service Intranet allowed document exchange and sharing across Ministries and Departments. During 2018, thirty-five new MAGNET III sites were commissioned.</p><p>Various initiatives were carried out across the Maltese government network infrastructure over the past 12 months. One of the major initiatives was the upgrade of the core Government network.</p><p class="subtitle">Government Core Network Upgrade</p><p><a href="https://mita.gov.mt/en/Pages/MITAHome.aspx">Malta’s Information Technology Agency</a> (MITA) core network infrastructure is the junction through which all network traffic originating from any government remote site gets transported to its intended recipient. The core network infrastructure is a fundamental building block on which MITA can provide a wide variety of government services.  </p><p>An important consideration as part of this upgrade was ensuring that performance would be significantly increased to have the required capacity for various upcoming government projects whilst at the same time ensure that reliability and availability of the infrastructure would not be compromised. As a result, all network components within the core infrastructure that spans across MITA’s two Data Centres were upgraded to support the various devices that demand bandwidth utilisation well in excess of 10Gbps.  </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Maltese Government Common Database</p><p>The Maltese Government Common Database (CdB) was enhanced with some minor amendments.  An ongoing effort is being done for the simplification of processes by internally sharing data and re-use previously gathered information, in line with the Once-Only Principle.  </p><p class="subtitle">National Data Portal</p><p>A beta version of the <a href="https://open.data.gov.mt">Portal</a> was soft-launched in April 2019. It enabled a shared data management platform for the finalisation of the Administrative Registers which will eventually serve as the backbone for all data governance services.</p><p class="subtitle">Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure (DSI)</p><p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/2017-mt-ia-0057">Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure</a> (DSI) is underpinned by the European Strategy for Cybersecurity: it provides an information sharing platform ("MeliCERTes") facilitating operational cooperation among Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), as well as funding for CSIRTs to effectively take part in its activities.</p><p>It implements the following activities:</p><p>Establishes a direct access point between CSIRTMalta (a national CSIRT) and MeliCERTes. The other beneficiaries - MT-CSIRT and CIS - will share information through CSIRTMalta;</p><p>Increases the preparedness of CSIRTMalta, CIS, and MT-CSIRT for the requirements and tasks arising from the NIS Directive, including training of beneficiaries' personnel.</p><p>The Action is in line with Malta’s National Cyber Security Strategy.</p><p class="subtitle">Notifications Service </p><p>As part of the eGovernment strategy to enhance citizen communication, the Government of Malta invested in an <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/en/eGov/DevelopmentToolkit/eGovServicestoolkit/Pages/Development-Toolkit---Notification-Services_b.aspx">eGovernment Shared Service</a> (eGSS), the Notifications Service, to enable a one-way communication channel between Government, citizens and businesses. The Notifications Service provides a gateway for messaging for both SMSs and emails, allowing citizens to be notified on various Governmental services instantly.</p><p>Through its web-based portal, it gives complete access to Government Ministries/Public Entities’ clients and administrators to send notifications, either individually or in bulk, via SMS and/or Email, to citizens and businesses. In 2018, on average, the Notification service was used to send approx. 330 000 SMS messages per month spread over 110 services spanning various Government Departments and Public Entities.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">EIDAS Node</p><p>In 2018, Malta was one of only four Member States that successfully met the regulatory deadline for the recognition of other Member States’ eID schemes under the EIDAS Regulation. As the operator of Malta’s EIDAS Node, MITA was successfully certified following a TickITplus ISO9001 and ISO27001 audit, and the Node was set in full production mode in July. The German middleware was successfully integrated in the environment in September, enabling the mandatory recognition of the notified German electronic identity scheme. This placed Malta as one of the top-running Member States in the adoption of the EIDAS Regulation and facilitates the early development of cross-border services. In 2019, plans will be made for such services also in the context of the Single Digital Gateway initiative.</p><p class="subtitle"><a href="https://identitymalta.com/id-cards/">National Identity Management System</a> (NIDMS)</p><p>The existing National Identity Management System aims to support the <strong>core identity management</strong> <strong>processes</strong> including the issuance of electronic identity cards (eID Card), ePassports, biometric visas and residence documents. The Government operates a number of identity management systems, the most important of which are: core database systems, electronic identity (e-ID) infrastructure, an electoral system, a national identity card system and the passport system. However, it should be noted that these and other disparate information systems are not entirely interoperable.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identity (eID)</p><p>To keep the eID solution secure, robust and stable for eGovernment service continuity, in 2014 the Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) approved a technology upgrade for the solution that included a migration to a newer and fully supported hosting platform, and an alignment of the software development platform to recent versions. The technology upgrade included the first phase of simplification of the authentication mechanism through the introduction of a new Single Sign-on screen for a harmonised user experience and additional security. In parallel, several high-level consultations were held to discuss the potential successive phases of simplification.</p><p>The technology<strong> </strong>upgrade for the eID solution was completed in 2016. The migration to the new environment resulted in a noticeable improvement in performance and stability and was achieved with no disruption to the subscribers and the relying parties. The new Single Sign-on screen was also launched, following a complete re-engineering of the user interface and functionality to achieve the desired simplification. This simplification in the user experience was accompanied by a complete overhaul of the registration and activation processes where the reliance on the PIN letter was removed in favour an electronic activation process. Several eGovernment services, notably Servizz.Gov, eforms, myhealth, taxation, ARMS and social security have since lined up to integrate with the new screen to achieve the desired outcomes.</p><p>In 2017, MITA completed the final phase of the simplification of the eID authentication mechanism which envisaged an alignment of the assurance levels to achieve a Basic Assurance level using the eID Account and password, and a High Assurance level using the ID Card and PIN. This provided a better choice of usability or security for subscribers and relying parties. The Basic Assurance level was intended to have a password with reduced mandatory complexity with an optional one-time password. The High Assurance level potentially involved additional usability challenges in view of the initial set up and installation of the ID Card, but still provided the additional security required.</p><p>In 2018, Identity Malta together with MITA addressed the priority technical gaps of the eID system with the GDPR.</p><p>In 2019, an optional two-factor authentication mechanism for eID based on a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) mechanism was introduced, intended for specific eGovernment services which require a substantial level of assurance. Support for the OpenID Connect Protocol to facilitate better access from native mobile applications was also introduced. Identity Malta together with MITA are now working on introducing a new personal dashboard for eID in 2020 which will allow subscribers to manage all their functionality from one location. The dashboard will be based on a latest generation user interface which will be responsive and accessible. </p><p>The achievements made and on-going work on the eID system mean that the Government has a stable and reliable platform for electronic authentication to enable eGovernment services at a local level, with different levels of assurance providing the required choice between usability and security. Future initiatives will include notifying the Malta eID scheme/s under the EIDAS Regulation to facilitate cross-border authentication with other Member States.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identity Cards (eID Card)</p><p>The eID Card is an identity card which in addition to the traditional identification features also includes an electronic component which allows the citizen to access an array of electronic services provided by the Government and other third parties.</p><p>Maltese nationals who are 14 years of age and older are entitled to an eID Card. The card’s electronic features are available to all card holders with one exception: the signature certificate is only available to citizens 18 years and older.</p><p>Residents who are not Maltese nationals, yet who are eligible for a residence document or residence permit, will have through electronic documents the same eID features as the eID Card. Specifically, EU nationals, spouses of EU nationals and regular third country nationals residing in Malta have the same eID features and accesses as Maltese nationals.</p><p>The electronic chip of the eID card holds the same biographic data that is visible on the face of the card, including a digital image of the citizen. The chip includes two digital certificates for authentication and signatures, and applications for ticketing and electronic purse.</p><p>The digital certificate for authentication enables the citizen to log in securely to the eGovernment services. The digital certificate for signatures is an enabler for electronic signatures. These are qualified certificates under the eCommerce Act and the electronic signature will be equivalent to a hand-written signature. Both certificates are protected by different Personal Identification Numbers (PINs).</p><p>The eID Card can be used by citizens to securely access their health information through the eGovernment services, but does not hold any sensitive health data on itself. An eID account is required to access health information through the myhealth.gov.mt portal. No fingerprint biometric data is held on the eID Card and it does not replace the Voting document issued by the Electoral Commission.</p><p class="subtitle">ePassports</p><p>Passports issued as from the 1 October 2008 are all e-passports. These 1<sup>st</sup> generation electronic passports had a BAC (Basic Access Control) chip. Biometrics captured were photo image and signature. As from 1 July 2010, the e-passports’ chip upgraded to EAC (Extended Access Control). Fingerprints were added to the biometrics captured.</p><p>On 30 March 2015, the e-passports’ chip upgraded to SAC (Supplemental Access Control). The same biometrics were captured, however, as the chip is the latest third generation to date.</p><p>The main reasons that led to the introduction of an e-passport were to;</p><p>Help fight passport fraud;</p><p>Reduce passport forgery;</p><p>Facilitate more robust border controls; and</p><p>Establish a link with the lawful owner.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Public Procurement System (ePPS) platform</p><p>The <a href="https://www.etenders.gov.mt/epps/home.do">eProcurement Solution</a> procured by the Government of Malta is the ePPS (electronic Public Procurement System) platform which is supplied by European Dynamics S.A. The platform was launched in July 2011 to facilitate the Maltese Government’s transition to online procurement, covering the full lifecycle of public procurement. The Solution constituted an eProcurement platform that comprised a core and a number of eProcurement-specific services, offering several parameterisation capabilities for meeting the exact needs of a Purchasing Authority. </p><p>The eProcurement solution enables actual tender bids to be submitted securely online using the most common procedures such as the open procedure and framework agreements as well as other more specific procedures such as negotiated procedure, competitive dialogue, restricted and concessions. The system also caters for new and unique procedures such as eAuctions and Dynamic Purchasing System. All procedures can be either evaluated using the lowest price, cost or best price quality ratio mechanism. The platform is currently used by the Department of Contracts, the Ministerial Procurement Units which represent different Contracting Authorities within that Ministry and individual Contracting Authorities that form part of the public sector.</p><p class="subtitle"><a href="http://contracts.gov.mt/en/Pages/Home-DepartmentOfContracts.aspx">Department of Contracts portal</a></p><p>Since the launch of the eProcurement platform for Malta, the Department’s portal has taken a different role. Rather than being an interactive site for economic operators to learn about and participate in tender opportunities, it now serves as a window for procurement regulations and policies across Government. Essentially, all the Public Procurement Regulations, Contracts Circulars, Procurement Policy Notes (PPNs) and Manuals of Procedures are available to all. Furthermore, there are also links to all the tenders published between 2008 and 2012 when the National eTenders <a href="https://www.etenders.gov.mt">portal</a> took over as the site for tender opportunities and other procurement resources like awards (1999-2017) plus the Department’s annual reports on the workings of the GCC.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474994"></a>eInvoicing</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">ePayment gateway</p><p>The eGovernment <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/en/eGov/DevelopmentToolkit/eGovServicestoolkit/Pages/Devolopers' Toolkit - Electronic Payments.aspx">electronic payment gateway</a> is part of the horizontal infrastructure supporting the Maltese eGovernment.
