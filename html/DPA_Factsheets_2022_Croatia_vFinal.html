The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below. </p><p><img src="img/35-357.png" alt="35-357.png" /> </p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021 </a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Croatia in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-405.png" alt="35-405.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Croatia’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall medium to good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring at the European average for most of the Principles and higher than the EU average for Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility). Areas of improvement are concentrated in the Principles 5 (Technological neutrality and data portability) and 9 (Multilingualism), for which the scores of 2 show a medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the country should not impose any technological solutions on citizens, businesses and other administrations that are technology-specific or disproportionate to their real needs (Principle 5 – Recommendation 08). In addition, Croatia should use information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing public services and decide on the level of multilingualism support based on the needs of the expected users (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16).</p><p><img src="img/35-416.png" alt="35-416.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Croatian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance with mostly scores of 4. The only potential area of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 is concentrated on interoperability governance and semantic interoperability, where Croatia scored 3. The lower score is due to the lower score for Recommendation 24, whereby Croatia should improve its participation in standardisation work relevant to citizens’ or businesses’ needs, to ensure that their requirements are met. </p><p><img src="img/35-426.png" alt="35-426.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Croatia’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a medium performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with almost all parameters, namely internal and external information sources and services, open data, catalogues, the conceptual model itself and security and privacy. However, to align with the European average, Croatia could improve the implementation of the recommendations related to Base Registries, by publishing the semantic and technical means and documentation needed for others to connect and reuse available information (Recommendation 38) and matching each base registry with appropriate metadata including the description of its content, service assurance and responsibilities, etc. </p><p>Additional information on Croatia’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

As part of the Programme, efforts were made to achieve a functional and accessible public administration and further digitisation. Moreover, for the purpose of increasing the efficiency of institutions, measures included the simplification of rules and the acceleration of the work of the administration through the digitisation of all processes with a view to expanding eServices to citizens and businesses, interconnecting all State administration bodies and establishing a uniform manner of communication between citizens and State administration bodies. </p><p>One of the programme’s objectives relating to public administration was the accomplishment of the digitisation of public services. The plan involved establishing a Central Government Information System, the optimisation of resources, the centralised management of all information systems and services in one place, and the introduction and use of electronic identification (eID) for all citizens. </p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk66194043"></a>National Plan for Recovery and Resilience</p><p>In 2021, the government adopted the <a href="https://planoporavka.gov.hr/">National Plan for Recovery and Resilience 2021-2026</a> (NPRR), which was approved by the European Commission in July 2021. The NPRR defines the following objectives, which are instrumental to implementing the digital transition of the Croatian society and economy:</p><p>- Increasing the efficiency and transparency of the work of public sector bodies</p><p>- Establishing management and coordination structures to plan and implement the digital transformation of society and public administration</p><p>- ensuring that public administration bodies have access to the tools and technologies needed to develop more economical and high-quality digital services in line with the needs of their users.</p><p>These goals are planned to be achieved through the implementation of reforms and related investments. The proposed reforms are based on the three main objectives of the EU's digital future strategy (Shaping Europe's Digital Future), which should ensure that Europe seizes the opportunity and gives its citizens, businesses and governments control over digital transformation: (i) technologies in the interest of citizens; (ii) a fair digital economy that fosters competition; and (iii) an open, democratic and sustainable society.</p><p>The Central State Office for the Development of the Digital Society is implementing the reform “C2.3. Digital transformation of society and public administration” aimed at solving existing challenges in monitoring and coordinating the digitisation process.</p><p>The Digital Croatia Strategy for the period until 2030 began being drafted in 2021. This reform is part of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, subcomponent C2.3, and complements the Development of the Coordination Mechanism to Support e-Governance Policy Coherence  project. Its objective is establishing a systematic approach to digitalisation, including strategic goals and priorities in the digitalisation of public administration and justice, development of broadband communication networks and recommendations concerning an action plan to improve interoperability.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">National Plan for Recovery and Resilience</p><p>The proposed reform called Improving the Interoperability of Information Systems will focus on the further development of public services and national information infrastructure, and on the establishment of a central interoperability system. This initiative will also contribute to the goal of the European Data Strategy of creating a single data market and to the smooth flow of data across various sectors at the EU, but also at the Croatian, level, for the benefit of companies, researchers and public administration. </p><p>The goal is to establish the interoperability of public registers and information systems and implement a central data warehouse and a platform for the exchange of Internet of Things (IoT) data. The introduction of a centralised IoT integration platform would enable the central collection and sharing of large amounts of data from various sensors and make all necessary tools available to the public and private sectors. The platform would be able to host applications whose function is to process and share available data in real time.</p><p class="subtitle">National Development Strategy 2030</p><p>In the National Development Strategy 2030, under the strategic goal ‘Digital Transition of Society and Economy’, investments in the State information infrastructure will continue in order to facilitate the development of new business models based on digital technologies by introducing interoperable solutions.

Its purpose was a systematic and coordinated implementation of activities necessary to raise the capacity of the Republic of Croatia in the field of cybersecurity, in order to build a safe society in the cyberspace. The general aim of this strategy was also to exploit the market potential of the information society, in particular of cybersecurity products and services. Since it was the first comprehensive strategy in the Republic of Croatia in the field of cybersecurity, the primary objective was to identify organisational problems in its implementation and raise awareness in society about the importance of this issue. It was necessary to encourage the coordination and cooperation of all State bodies and public authorities, but also other sectors of society, in order to establish new functionalities, raise the efficiency of relevant stakeholders, use existing resources more effectively and better plan usage needs.</p><p>In 2017, the government of the Republic of Croatia renewed its <a href="https://www.uvns.hr/en/legislation/national-security">National Security Strategy</a>. The strategic goals of the strategy are: achieving the highest level of population and critical infrastructure security and protection, establishing and developing a homeland security system, developing and maintaining strong and active defence, and developing a strong and sustainable economy, demographic renewal and revitalisation of the Croatian society, developing citizen-friendly public administration and strategic communication, protecting, strengthening and promoting highest constitutional values and the Croatian national identity, increasing the international reputation and influence of the Republic of Croatia. The Republic of Croatia will develop measures to strengthen the resilience of information and communication systems in cyberspace as well as to mitigate the negative consequences of any threats or disruptions thereto. The emphasis is on the key systems needed for the normal functioning of State institutions as well as the storage, transmission and exchange of citizens classified and personal data. </p><p>Since the Cyber security strategy for the digital decade of the European Union has been adopted, the revision of the National Strategy on Cybersecurity and the accompanying Action Plan for its implementation have begun and are expected to be completed in 2022.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle">Public Administration Development Strategy 2021<a id="_Hlk100568975"></a>–2027</p><p>The Government of the Republic of Croatia has adopted a <a href="https://vlada.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/2016/Sjednice/2021/Travanj/52 sjednica VRH/52 - 11 a.docx">decision</a> on initiating the procedure for drafting the <a href="https://esavjetovanja.gov.hr/ECon/MainScreen?entityId=19440">National Public Administration Development Plan 2021 –2027</a>.

At the end of 2021, 99 eServices were available to citizens on the portal. </p><p>An integral component of the eCitizen portal is NIAS (National Identification and Authentication System) that serves as a secure and reliable identification and authentication mechanism for citizens who access public electronic services through the appropriate credentials.</p><p>Another integral part of the eCitizen portal is the User Mailbox, where public institutions can send 122 kinds of personalised messages with various information and notifications, such as information about the expiration of personal documents, individual documents and the status of individual proceedings.</p><p>As of 3 May 2021, the redesigned e-Citizens Portal was released to the public. The redesign process was guided by an agile project management methodology, and the redesign itself was aimed at improving the portal user experience, as well as improving the interface clarity, simplicity and usability. All pages are equally usable regardless of the device through which the citizen accesses them (computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, etc.).</p><p>The redesign also introduced new paradigms in thinking about the life roles of citizens (individual, parenthood, entrepreneurship, etc.) and for each role the e-Citizens system must ensure easy use of services without additional login and identification.</p><p>The redesign introduced a new central component, the Navigation Bar, as part of a single user interface in all public e-services, whether for individuals or business users. The navigation bar allows users to easily and quickly select the entity <a id="_Hlk97039974"></a>on whose behalf they want to act and use the selected e-service (business users for their businesses and parents for their children). The selection of the entity on whose behalf the user wants to act is retrieved automatically from public registers.</p><p>The new electronic services implemented in the eCitizen system during 2021 were: </p><ul><li><strong>Delivery of electronic documents for vehicle registration in the Republic of Croatia</strong>, enabling delivery of electronic documents in the vehicle registration, testing and homologation procedures.</li><li><strong>e-Renewal</strong>, enabling owners and co-owners of earthquake-damaged houses and buildings to submit requests for reconstruction or financial assistance</li><li><strong>Geoportal of the City of Jastrebarsko</strong>, enabling citizens to submit a request to change the data related to the utility fee, report a utility infrastructure problem and propose changes to local spatial plans.</li><li><strong>e-Enrolment in educational institutions</strong>, which enables submitting and monitoring the status of applications for enrolment of a child in preschool education institutions (in this phase, the service is enabled for enrolment in kindergarten).</li><li><strong>EU Digital COVID certificate</strong>, enabling citizens to obtain a digital vaccination, testing and recovery certificate during the COVID-19 epidemic..</li><li><strong>Request for issuance of a card for the maritime transport of persons with disabilities</strong>, enabling submission of applications for the issuance of the card for free transport on state ferry lines.</li><li><strong>e-Application for life partnership</strong>, enabling partners to submit an application to enter into a life partnership.</li><li><strong>Census of population, households and dwellings in the Republic of Croatia in 2021</strong>, enabling citizens self-enumeration using the census questionnaire in electronic form.</li><li><strong>My network - HEP Distribution System Operator</strong>, enabling citizens delivery of information regarding their connection to the electricity network.</li><li><strong>e-Driving schools</strong>, enabling legal entities and craftsmen to submit requests for opening a new driving school.</li><li><strong>Selection of pension</strong> (pension only from the 1<sup>st</sup> pillar or pension from the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> pillar), which enables the selection of pensions in electronic form.</li><li><strong>Pension Insurance Company (registration/change),</strong> which enables the registration/change of pension insurance company in electronic form.</li><li><strong>Register of tax advisors</strong>, which enables natural and legal persons to submit applications for registration in the register of tax advisors.</li></ul><p>By setting up the eCitizen system, a major step was taken to modernise public services and to bring public administration closer to citizens. </p><p>Since the beginning of its operation until the end of December 2021, there were 1 571 744 unique users of the eCitizen system and there were as many as 80 040 135 logins to the available eServices. </p><p class="subtitle">e-Business (integrated into eCitizens portal)</p><p>The <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/e-poslovanje/1584">e-Business project</a> aims at contributing to administrative relief for business entities through electronic communication with public administration. Its main goal is to achieve financial and time savings for businesses, increase the availability of public services and efficiency of public administration while strengthening the capacity of officials and employees.</p><p>The components of the e-Business project, which are also integral component of the State information infrastructure are: the e-Citizen portal (Gov.hr) with public information and electronic services for businesses, the National Identification and Authentication System (NIAS) with a new subsystem of e-Authorization for a single login for business users to e-services and the Navigation Bar as part of a common user interface of e-services. The Navigation Bar enables users to choose the business entity on whose behalf they wish to act, and also contains the link to User Mailbox (KP) for secure and reliable communication with individual business entities.</p><p>The Navigation Bar that enables users to choose the business entity on whose behalf they wish to act is connected with various business registers. Users authorised to represent legal entities are automatically retrieved trough the Navigation Bar from several registers: the Court Register, the Registers of non-profit organizations (Register of Associations, Foundations, Political Parties and Religious Communities), the Trade Register for crafts, and the Register of Farmers and Family Farms.</p><p>In addition, the persons authorised to represent may, through the e-Authorization and its e-Power of Attorney form, grant the right of access to other persons within their business entity or other persons in another business entity. This functionality provides all business users with the necessary flexibility while accessing to and using the public e-services available.</p><p>As part of the project activities carried out during 2021, a test and production platform was established, on which the integration of the first e-services intended for business entities began (6 e-services are to this day available on the e-Citizens portal under the Business heading). The implementation of the e-Business project has been interpolated with the implementation of the e-Citizens redesign, resulting in a new central component: the Navigation Bar, as part of a single user interface in all public e-services, whether for individuals or business users.

The decision authorises FINA to set up a communication network of State administration bodies, and to provide common services (network and application) to them.</p><p>There are currently 560 public bodies connected through the HITRONet infrastructure. The network is regularly maintained and monitored based on its traffic load. This network also provides access to the internet and secure interconnection of the involved institutions. It also enables the institutions of the Republic of Croatia to join EU-wide services provided through the latest generation of TESTAng networks as a common network of EU Member States. Through the HITRONet network, Croatian bodies use over 17 different services provided by the European Commission to Member States.</p><p>In addition to locations connected via HITRONet, some sites of public law bodies are connected to the CARNET network. CARNET is under the responsibility of the Ministry of Science and Education. It is a private network of the Croatian academic and scientific research community, and institutions from the elementary and secondary education system, which connects 1 800 institutions in 3 226 locations. The CARNET facility owns part of the network infrastructure and it mainly leases lines from a range of telecommunications providers.</p><p>Additionally, several institutions are connected to the CARNET network, specifically: 277 within the competence of the Ministry of Labour, Pension System, Family and Social Policy, 1 185 of the Ministry of Health and Public Health Institutions, 8 of the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development, 4 of the Ministry of Defence and 2 of the Ministry of the Interior.</p><p class="subtitle">eBulletin Board and Court Networking Project </p><p>The <a href="https://e-oglasna.pravosudje.hr/">eBulletin Board and Court Networking Project </a>was initiated to develop a single intranet and internet network for judicial bodies, which will create the prerequisites for the exchange of documents and information within the judiciary. </p><p>The eBulletin Board is a free and public service that enables the overview of electronic bulletin boards of courts and other competent authorities in the Republic of Croatia.</p><p>The central search engine enables to look for published decisions and other documents of municipal, county, commercial and administrative courts in the Republic of Croatia, as well as the enforcement proceedings of FINA and public notaries.</p><p>All notifications by the competent authorities are published without delay and automatically removed upon expiry.</p><p>The Ministry of Justice, as the highest judicial administration body, provides the technical preconditions for the information system described.

The StuDOM infrastructure covers 11 student dormitories in 7 Croatian cities.</p><p class="subtitle">Broadband infrastructure</p><p>In order to achieve the full potential of digital transformation, the Republic of Croatia has provided significant resources for the promotion of broadband infrastructure. With the aim of removing the existing barriers to investing in the mobile network market and enabling the increase of the investment potential of public mobile network operators, the Republic of Croatia has abolished one-off fees for the use of the radio frequency spectrum for public mobile networks. Furthermore, the annual fee for the use of the radio frequency spectrum (1900 MHz - 1920 MHz) was abolished, thus opening up the possibility of new market investments and competitiveness. A mechanism was introduced by virtue of which an equal annual fee for the use of the unused radio frequency spectrum will apply to all operators of public mobile networks in the Republic of Croatia.</p><p>One of the key projects in the area of connectivity is the <a href="https://nop.hakom.hr/">Framework National Programme for the Development of Broadband Infrastructure</a> in areas where there is insufficient commercial interest to invest, managed by the Croatian Regulatory Authority for Network Industries (HAKOM). The aim of this framework programme is to develop the Next Generation Access Broadband Infrastructure (NGA) in areas where there is insufficient commercial interest for operators and market providers to invest. The programme is a national framework scheme, which follows a number of individual projects in a narrower local area. Individual projects are managed by public authorities at local and/or regional level (municipalities, cities and counties) as individual project promoters. </p><p>Another key project is the <a href="https://mmpi.gov.hr/vijesti-8/vlada-rh-usvojen-nacionalni-program-razvoja-sirokopojasne-agregacijske-infrastrukture-u-podrucjima-u-kojima-ne-postoji-dostatan-komercijalni-interes-za-ulaganja-np-bbi-program/6950">National Broadband Aggregation Infrastructure Development Programme</a> in areas where there is insufficient commercial interest to invest (NP–BBI).

This goal includes the introduction of 5G networks for urban areas and major land routes, and the introduction of 5G networks for rural areas.</p><p>In January 2020 the government of the Republic of Croatia adopted a resolution on Osijek as the Croatian 5G City and Slavonia as the first Croatian region to operate 5G networks commercially.</p><p>HAKOM awarded the radio frequency spectrum in the 700 MHz (758-788 / 703-733 MHz), 3600 MHz (3400-3800 MHz) and 26 GHz frequency bands (26.5-27.5 GHz) for the 5<sup>th</sup> generation mobile communications networks on 12 August 2021.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Shared Services Centre</p><p>The national <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/uspostava-centra-dijeljenih-usluga/1596">Shared Services Centre</a> (‘State Cloud’) is one of the key projects that will integrate the State information infrastructure, and enable the sharing of ICT as well as the same horizontal application solutions. All public sector bodies will be able to use shared, reliable and scalable ICT infrastructure according to the cloud paradigm. The goal of the project is to integrate 300 institutions into the State Cloud by 2022. Through the Shared Services Centre, the State will gain faster access to the latest technologies that are the basis for providing more digital public administration services in the most efficient way and in the shortest possible time.</p><p>The project partner in the implementation of this project is the Information System and Information Technologies Support Agency (APIS IT). The Shared Services Centre was officially launched on November 25, 2019.</p><p>The project received a grant of HRK 306 644 668.87 from the ERDF through the 2014–2020 Operational Programme ‘Competitiveness and Cohesion’. The total project value is HRK 360 758 433.97 and the project will last until 31 December 2023.</p><p>The project will result in the consolidation of the State information infrastructures, based on the principles of the shared services model. Moreover, it will aim at the implementation of an infrastructure for an interconnectivity and interoperability platform that will include key enablers required for the Metaregistry, the GSB, the distributed eServices architecture and State platforms. The development of shared services will also be pursued.</p><p>The project includes several platforms that have already been developed:</p><ul><li>IaaS: virtual servers, dedicated servers, long-term data storage (eArchive), business continuity and recovery of stored data (BCM/DR), secure data storage; </li><li>PaaS: digital archive platform, multi-tenant database and distributed database management system, multi-tenant central application layer, public sector collaboration and communication platform, business intelligence platform; </li><li>SaaS: integrated document, case, workflow and archive management system, management and cost accounting and public procurement software support services; and</li><li>CaaS: business process modelling, business process optimisation, implementation of ICT standards and ICT technologies, system engineering support, IT strategy support and technical specification preparation for ICT procurement procedures, project management, IT project supervision and audit.</li></ul><p>In 2021, an additional 131 users (institutions) were included in the SCC, so to this date the SCC has a total of 233 users. Some of the main and largest users who migrated their systems to the SCC are: the State Geodetic Administration (Digital Geodetic Study System), the Croatian Bureau of Statistics (Census of population 2021), the Ministry of Agriculture (internal systems), the Ministry of Culture (e-Culture), the Ministry of Tourism (e-Tourism), the Ministry of Health (eCjepih, eCEZDLIH), the Ministry of Physical Planning, the Construction and State Property (ePlan, ePermit i eConstruction journal), the Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development (Trade Register, SMIV, SZP), the Croatian Fire Brigade (VATROnet), the Clinic for Children's Diseases Zagreb and the Clinical Hospital Centres in Osijek and Split (Radiological Information System), the Clinical Hospital Centres in Rijeka and the Sisters of Mercy (hospital information system).</p><p>In the NPRR, further development of new functionalities of the Shared Services Centre is planned.

The Government Service Bus (GSB), as a main component of the Central Interoperability System, enables safe and secure data exchange among services and registers. SSC service users are able to announce the GSB interface in two ways: (a) putting an interface directly into the GSB network and announce API in the GSB API catalogue to enable that interface to be reused by other SSC platforms, (b) developing an interface on the GSB platform to enable further orchestration and data manipulation. </p><p>The process of integrating public registers in the GSB started precisely to develop a complex electronic registration and enrolment eService in educational institutions. This project envisages the integration of eight registers (veterans register, birth register, residence register, etc.) through the GSB. The process includes the publication of the application service (application programming interface or API) on the GSB and the use of this application service in order to retrieve data from public registers.</p><p>The second eService that is important in this context is eRenovation, i.e. a digital system that enables the submission of requests for renewal attaching all necessary documentation, monitors the implementation of the renewal procedure, displays renewal data on the Geoportal and provides reports according to various criteria.</p><p>In 2021, the GSB integrated 17 institutions, which presented (exposed) their registers and records to the GSB in order to ensure secure data exchange between State bodies and institutions. A total of 17 State administration bodies exposed 23 registers and records in the GSB production environment. </p><p>In 2021, 13 institutions that retrieved data for their business processes were integrated into the GSB. A total of 39 web services/APIs have been integrated for data download.</p><p>The projects e-Enrolment, e-Tourism, e-Renovation, Asset records for the State Attorney's Council and for the State Judicial Council are the biggest beneficiaries of the integration of registries at the GSB level.</p><p>In 2021, a total of 695 323 inquiry messages were sent through the GSB and an equal number of responses were delivered to institutions for the completion of business processes (production environment).</p><p class="subtitle">Improving the System of Electronic Services</p><p>The project ‘<a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/unaprjedjenje-sustava-elektronickih-usluga/344">Improving the System of Electronic Services</a>’, aimed at defining the standard for the development of new e-services and continuous digitalisation of public administration operations, was completed in February 2021.</p><p>As a result of the project, in April 2021 the Government of the Republic of Croatia adopted the <a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/SDURDD-dokumenti/54 - 7a_Prijedlog standarda razvoja javnih e-Usluga u Republici Hrvatskoj.pdf">Conclusion on the Standard for the Development of Public e-Services in the Republic of Croatia.</a></p><p class="subtitle">Implementation of e-Standard and further improvement of electronic services system</p><p>As a logical extension of the project ‘Improving the System of Electronic Services’, in August 2021 a new project started –‘<a href="https://rdd.gov.hr/projekti-i-eu-projekti/eu-projekti/implementacija-e-standarda-i-daljnje-unaprjedjenje-sustava-elektronickih-usluga/1864">Implementation of eStandard and further improvement of electronic services system</a>’ - whose goal is to implement the standard through the establishment of appropriate tools and process digitisation. </p><p>The project will establish an information system that will support all processes defined within the e-Standard to ensure a clear picture of the development status of e-services. It will enable all stakeholders to monitor the development status of each e-service, and the availability of all documents and artifacts that are created through e-services development projects in one central repository. </p><p>A portal with all important information on the development of e-services will be established, standardised user interfaces (graphic design) will be developed as building blocks for the development of e-services, rules and guidelines for developing graphic interfaces will be developed. Through this project life situations will be analysed, and their register created. Based on the register of life situations, the priorities and the needs of citizens and business entities will be defined, in order to develop or improve e-services that target those needs.</p><p>The project implementation period is 24 months (August 2021 - August 2023).</p><p class="subtitle">National Spatial Data Infrastructure</p><p>For centuries spatial data have been interpreted and visualised on analogue maps, which until recently have been the main tool for the perception, understanding and orientation of objects and events in space. The appearance and development of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) opened up new possibilities of managing spatial data and their characteristics.</p><p>Standardised data can be more easily exploited by users, in order to promote a faster and more efficient regional economic development. In addition, the financial savings that can be achieved in the process place new demands on spatial data. Thus, in order to speed up development in this field, Europe has launched the INSPIRE initiative, linking together the national spatial data infrastructures.</p><p>For this reason, the <a href="http://www.nipp.hr/">National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) </a>is defined as a set of technologies, measures, standards, implementation rules, services, human resources and other factors enabling efficient integration, management and maintenance of the sharing of spatial data, which will be an integral part of the European Spatial Data Infrastructure defined by the INSPIRE Directive.</p><p>The NSDI gives the possibility to discover, view and use spatial data to government bodies, businesses, non-commercial and public sector entities, the academic community and citizens in general.</p><p>The Croatian NSDI will have to be harmonised with the development of spatial data infrastructures at the European (INSPIRE) and global (GSDI, UN-GGIM) level. Moreover, the infrastructure at national level will also need to influence the development of spatial data infrastructures at the local level.</p><p class="subtitle">Starting a business</p><p>Since December 2019, entrepreneurs in Croatia can start their business in just a few days, through this new eService. Several existing processes and systems to start a business are merged into a single process: registration of the company in the Court Register, registration of the craft business in the Craft Register, entry in the Register of Business Entities, registration in the Register of Taxpayers and the VAT Register and/or assignment of a VAT number, submission of a bank account request, registration in the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute system, and electronic payment of fees and founding capital.</p><p>Between the launch of the START system on 02.12.2019 and 31.12.2021. a total of 2 497 companies (1 501 limited liability companies and 996 simple limited liability companies) and 381 trades have been started through the START system.</p><p>The National Recovery and Resilience Plan 2021-2026, within C1.1.1.
