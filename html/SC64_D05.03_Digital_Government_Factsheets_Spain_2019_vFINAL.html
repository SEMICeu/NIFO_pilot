There are: Identification (eID), Electronic documents (eDocuments), Authoritative Sources, and Digital Post. Digital Post refers to the possibility that governments communicate electronically-only with citizens or entrepreneurs through e.g. personal mailboxes or other digital mail solutions.</li></ul><p>These top-level benchmarks are measured using a life-events (e.g. mystery shopping) approach. Eight life events are included in the overall eGovernment performance score.

This meant that 94.64% of the population was now covered by the National Health System.</p><p>The objective of this SNS project is to improve the attention given to citizens when they demand health assistance in their geographical displacements, guaranteeing access to a series of clinical data sets of the patient, generated in any Autonomous Health Service.</p><p>This project is connected to the EU initiatives for the communication of clinical information among Member States.
