The strategy accounts for the relevance given to digital competences by the European Commission in its communication (COM/2020/67) Shaping Europe’s digital future. The strategy acknowledges that digital competences represent a strategic priority for social and economic growth. In this regard, a sustainable social and economic growth shall occur only if three conditions are in place:</p><ul><li>Increase of digital awareness among the population – this would enable citizens to better exploit the benefits stemming from the digital world;</li><li>Acquisition of general and specific digital competences by public administrations and companies – these competences would help them to improve the way they provide services to their users; and</li><li>Reorganisation of the educational system to address the need to develop digital competences. </li></ul><p>The National Strategy for Digital Competences seeks to achieve these objectives by relying on the following principles: </p><ul><li>Digital education – digital awareness and digital competences are paramount characteristics of citizenship and should be facilitated both by public and private efforts in schools, universities and media; </li><li>Digital citizenship – technology can foster the development of new forms of citizenship based on quality information, active participation in decision‑making processes, civil interaction and smoother relations between citizens and the public administration; and</li><li>Digital ethics – the digital world can become a space of equality and development both for the community and the individuals.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">2014-2020 Digital Growth Strategy</p><p>In addition to general legislative measures and a strategy concerning the Digital Agenda, the Council of Ministers approved the <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/documentazione/strat_crescita_digit_3marzo_0.pdf">2014-2020 Digital Growth</a> Strategy, the <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/sites/default/files/repository_files/documentazione/bul_4_marzodef_0.pdf">Ultra‑Wideband Plan and the National Broadband Strategy</a> on 3 March 2015. All plans were defined by the Agency for Digital Italy (AgID) and the MISE under the coordination of the Prime Minister.</p><p>The new national Ultra-Wideband Plan proposed a virtuous mix of public and private investments. If individuals invest as much as the public sector, the goal that can be reached is higher than the European minimum. The objective of the Italian Ultra-Wideband Plan is to bridge this infrastructure gap, creating favourable market conditions for the integrated development of the telecommunications infrastructure, fixed and mobile, with actions such as:</p><ul><li>Incentives aimed at bringing down the barriers of implementation costs, simplifying and reducing administrative burdens;</li><li>Coordination in the management of the subsurface through the establishment of a below and above-ground register to ensure the monitoring of operations and the best use of existing infrastructure;</li><li>Alignment with other European countries in the field of electromagnetism limits;</li><li>Tax incentives and credit at subsidised rates in the most profitable areas to promote the quantum leap;</li><li>Public incentives to invest in marginal areas;</li><li>Direct development of public infrastructure in the market failure areas.</li></ul><p>Public resources are available through European funds such as the European Rural Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the European Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, for a total of EUR 6 billion, in addition to the funds from the Juncker Plan.</p><p>The national Ultra-Wideband Plan is tied to the Digital Growth Strategy. The strategy has been designed to adapt gradually to the scenarios in the 2014-2020 period. It is a strategy aimed at promoting digital literacy among citizens and businesses, with the help of public levers. </p><p>The <a href="http://www.pongovernance1420.gov.it/it/progetto/italia-login/">Italia Login project</a> stems from the Digital Strategy and aims to build the so-called Citizens’ House. The system is designed as an open structure where various actors from the public administration contribute to their area of expertise. The public administration creates a single platform and opens its data, providing services available to businesses and citizens. The necessary user-centric approach requires the development the public information system to be redesigned. Every citizen can access all the information and services concerning themselves on Italia Login. </p><p class="subtitle">Three-Year Plan for IT in the Public Administration</p><p>The <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/">Three-Year Plan for IT in the Public Administration</a> was defined in accordance with the <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/en/faqs/">Digital Growth Strategy</a>, with the aim of targeting public sector ICT investments according to government guidelines and in line with European goals and programmes. The plan proposes a systematic, distributed and shared management and use model applicable to the most innovative digital technologies. This approach would be characterised by an agile and evolutionary management style, based on clear governance of the various levels of public administration. The synergy and balance between the three pillars (innovative technologies, agile management style and clear and effective model of governance) ensures the country is more effective in benefiting from new technologies and provides citizens with an advantage in terms of ease of access and improvement of existing digital services.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/">AgID</a> is in charge of executing the plan and coordinating the support to central and local public administration bodies in the implementation of the plan.</p><p>In March 2019, the former Minister for Simplification and Public Administration, Giulia Bongiorno, approved the <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/assets/pdf/2019-2021/Piano-Triennale-ICT-2019-2021.pdf">2019-2022 Three-Year Plan for Information Technology in the Public Administration</a>. The new plan foresees actions to accelerate the transition to digital administrations and local entities and to empower citizens and businesses in being active protagonists of innovation.</p><p>The plan outlines the actions needed to promote the digital transformation of the public sector, moving in the same direction defined by the 2017-2019 plan. In particular, the new plan:</p><ul><li>Supports the inclusive path of digital growth of national and local governments, with greater involvement of the key actors of the digital transition;</li><li>Defines the fundamental architectural principles, the interoperability rules of national infrastructures, and the cooperation model between different ecosystems and platforms;</li><li>Facilitates the relationship between public administration bodies and the market, also involving private actors in the development of integrated and interoperable services; and</li><li>Introduces a novel perspective to understand the digital transformation, with a particular focus on identifying the areas of intervention and the impact on the main actors (citizens, businesses and public administration bodies).</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Designers Italia</p><p><a href="https://developers.italia.it/en/designers/">Designers Italia</a> is a national innovation project launched in June 2017 by the <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/">AgID</a> and the <a href="https://teamdigitale.governo.it/">Digital Transformation Team</a>. It calls upon the world of design, both inside and outside the public administration, to strengthen the role of design thinking in the planning of digital public services.</p><p>Designers Italia is a meeting point between people and technology, with the aim of designing simple and citizen-friendly services.</p><p>Designers Italia represents the benchmark for public administration design: guides, tools and a forum to foster collaboration among designers and to strengthen the role of design in developing public services.</p><p>The main objectives of this project are:</p><ul><li>Understanding citizens’ needs across a plethora of situations and moods they experience while interacting with the public administration;</li><li>Including people’s point of view in the process of designing and choosing technologies for public digital services;</li><li>Striving to make technology simpler, through a process of continuous improvement; and</li><li>Helping people understand the new digital tools, while giving them ways to familiarise themselves with changes.</li></ul><p>The Designers Italia website contains several sections: service design, content design, user interface, user research, projects, a blog and some <em>read the docs</em> and <em>discourse</em> forums contributing to the drafting of texts and to the free exchange of views. Finally, the website also includes a <em>Behance</em> channel, where mainly web designers can share their projects.</p><p>The site is first and foremost a community of practices to strengthen skills, encourage networking, and facilitate the encounter between supply and demand. On the site, people can talk about concrete projects that can align the country’s top priorities. The government can compare best practices, thanks to a forum with sections dedicated to service design, user research, content design and user interface design. In each area the government publishes kits, which are a set of tools available to everyone: guides, checklists and templates, prototyping tools, and open-source coding to create digital services without having to reinvent the wheel.</p><p>Designers Italia is about a different and unique kind innovation thanks to the way it involves the stakeholders, and more generally citizens, through the forum and the use of <em>Behance</em>. This allows private designers to contribute, with their knowledge and experience, to the implementation of design guidelines.</p><p>Designers Italia is heading in the direction of creating a real and proper design system for the public administration.</p><p>The design system offered intends to:</p><ul><li>Affirm shared standards. The community serves to improve these standards and to evolve them by sharing experiences: for this reason, there is a forum with several discussion threads and a blog showcasing design case studies and trends. All people involved in design within the public administration can come forward and contribute;</li><li>Foster dialogue between external professionals and the world of public administration. Thus, the project devotes space to information and operating tools on how to organise and participate in public procurement. All professionals interested in working to improve public services are invited to participate;</li><li>Leverage common solutions, such as the <em>PagoPA</em> payment system, in order to initiate a process of continuous improvement and encourage the adoption by as many administrations as possible; and</li><li>Create site and service templates; for that, designers have launched pilot projects in different areas (e.g. municipalities), thereby starting a process that will allow the community to generalise the identified solutions and make them available to others.</li></ul><p>Public administration bodies have the capacity to either acquire the methodology and knowledge offered by designers to build their own services internally (internal resources or in-house service providers) or rely on the guidelines on design competitions and public procurement for external supplies. Guidelines are always updated thanks to the feedback of the community, becoming a living space for a constant and democratic debate.</p><p>In March 2019, the national <a href="https://designers.italia.it/guide">guide</a> for designing public administration web services were updated. </p><p>In addition, graphic components were provided to developers and designers through the new <a href="https://designers.italia.it/kit/ui-kit/">UI toolkit</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Cloud Strategy </p><p>The <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/it/infrastrutture/cloud-pa/cloud-per-la-pa">Cloud Strategy</a> of the public administration was created to encourage the adoption of the cloud computing model, in line with the country’s guidelines on the Digital Growth Strategy and the provisions of the <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/">2019-2021 Three-Year Plan for Information Technology in the Public Administration</a>. The Cloud Strategy also aims to qualify services and cloud infrastructures according to specific security and reliability parameters suitable for the needs of public administration bodies, in accordance with the following principles:</p><ul><li>Improvement of service levels, accessibility, usability and security;</li><li>Interoperability of services within the cloud model of public administration bodies;</li><li>Reduction of the risk of vendor lock-in, i.e. creation of a dependency relationship with the service provider;</li><li>Requalification of the offer, expansion and diversification of the suppliers’ market;</li><li>Resilience, scalability, reversibility and data protection; and</li><li>Opening up of the market to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</li></ul><p>The adoption of the cloud infrastructure improves the operational efficiency of ICT systems, achieves significant cost reductions, makes it easier and cheaper to update software, improves security and data protection, and speeds up the delivery of services to citizens and businesses.</p><p>The cloud strategy outlined by AgID creates the prerequisites needed by public and private entities to provide cloud infrastructures and services to the public administration, so that the latter can adopt consistent cloud computing services and infrastructures that meet high security, efficiency and reliability standards in line with the provisions of <a href="https://cloud-pa.readthedocs.io/it/latest/">circulars AgID No. 2 and No. 3 </a>of 9 April 2018.</p><p>AgID has outlined the compliance requirements for security, performance and scalability, interoperability, portability, as well as the ones relating to the organisational and legislative aspects.

The plan, covering the period 2019-2021, aims at transforming the relationship between citizens and the public sector. The plan is the outcome of complex coordination work of all institutional and civil society representatives on ten thematic areas:</p><ol><li>Open data;</li><li>Transparency;</li><li>Register of beneficial owners;</li><li>Support to participation;</li><li>Regulating access of stakeholders to decision-makers in public administration;</li><li>Culture of open government;</li><li>Corruption prevention;</li><li>Simplification;</li><li>Digital services; and</li><li>Digital citizenship and skills. </li></ol><p>Along the most consolidated sectors of open government – open data, transparency, digital skills and services – the plan presents new measures on consultation policies, the register of beneficial owners and regulations on stakeholders, proving that opening processes are now mature.</p><p>The Fourth Action Plan relies upon two main innovations that will ensure a higher quality of commitments compared to the previous action plans. First, the involvement of the Open Government Forum represented a key element as both public administration bodies and civil society organisations were able to discuss and agree upon the objectives to be achieved by 2021. Second, the final document shifted from a high number of actions implemented by single administrations to a smaller number of actions shared by different administrations. This enabled a more efficient convergence of the actions and the optimisation of resources.</p><p>In May 2020, the Italian government <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/news/canada-italy-and-kenya-elected-to-to-guide-the-open-government-partnership/">has been appointed</a> as member of the Steering Committee of the Open Government Partnership. Hence, as a member of the committee, the Italian government will play an important role in bringing together governments, the civil society and all the other stakeholders to guarantee an open and effective response to the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p class="subtitle">Third Open Government Partnership Action Plan</p><p>In September 2016, Italy published its <a href="file:///C:/Users/dima/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/X1DO7MPN/"http:/open.gov.it/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/2016-10-07-3rd-NAP-Italy-English-version.pdf">Third Open Government Partnership Action Plan</a>. The plan, covering the period 2016-2018, is the result of a joint effort of more than 20 public administration bodies and the First National Forum on Open Government, which was attended by more than 60 organisations (universities, research centres, consumer associations and trade associations).</p><p>The central themes of the plan are open data and transparency, participation and accountability, digital citizenship and innovation. </p><p>With this new plan the Italian government wants to strongly relaunch its commitment on open government, transparency, digital citizenship, participation and accountability, which are also the fundamental objectives of the public administration. The plan contained 34 actions divided into three thematic areas:</p><ul><li>Open data and transparency (12 actions);</li><li>Participation and accountability (16 actions);</li><li>Digital citizenship and innovation (six actions). </li></ul><p>The plan included actions that enabled the country to open up further, in line with such Open Government Partnership values as access to the public sector, civic participation, accountability and digitalisation of public administration.</p><p>After the adoption of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which was part of the public administration reform, the government worked to ensure the right of civic access and monitor its implementation.</p><p>Among the first countries to adhere to the International Open Data Charter, Italy today is equipped with a new open data strategy for the public administration in order to prioritise requests coming from civil society, improve the quality and availability of information, enhance transparency and promote the reuse of published data.</p><p>With the third action plan, Italy gives continuity to different projects like <em>Soldipubbici, OpenCoesione, ItaliaSicura</em> and <em>Opencantieri</em>, strengthening them and launching other initiatives on transparency in government investment.</p><p>Furthermore, the plan includes the participation of local administrations: municipal and regional authorities are engaged in projects on corruption prevention and protection of digital rights.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>SPID – Public Digital Identity System</p><p><a href="https://www.spid.gov.it/">SPID</a> is the solution that allows users to access all online public administration services with a single digital identity (username and password) that can be used from computers, tablets and smartphones. Its usage is becoming commonly accepted among public administration bodies and citizens: in 2020, more than 7000 public administration bodies and more than 15 million citizens decided to adopt it. </p><p>The use of SPID was extended to natural persons acting on behalf of legal entities. This would make it possible to replicate the effect of an authenticated signature.</p><p>SPID is rapidly evolving and AgID is currently working on different regulations to increase the involvement of the private sector either through the introduction of special entities called ‘aggregators’ or through the introduction of the so-called ‘attribute authorities’ that will release qualified attributes to citizens and professionals authenticated with SPID.</p><p>Soon, minors will also be able to obtain SPID identities, so we expect an important increase in the number of identities issued.</p><p>The introduction of the OpenID Connect technology to complement the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) technology currently in use will reduce the burden to authenticate the subjects requesting the SPID. As for eIDs, the dissemination of electronic identity cards made it possible to initiate the process of eID notification, pursuant to Article 9 of the eIDAS Regulation, which was fully implemented in the first half of 2019.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic ID card</p><p>AgID started the process to integrate the Italian electronic ID card to be used within public administration bodies in the Member States.</p><p>Public consultations to define the guidelines to integrate the use of electronic ID cards for professional usage were concluded. The guidelines identified the way identity providers should proceed to release electronic ID cards for professional usage in order to verify the affiliation of individuals to organisations and their professional expertise.</p><p>The Italian <a href="https://www.eid.gov.it/home?lang=en-001">eIDAS</a> node is active and interconnected with Belgium, Estonia, Greece, Spain and Sweden. Italian citizens can access the public administration services offered by those countries.</p><h3>Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle">Cybersecurity</p><p>AgID, in compliance with the Directive of the President of the Council of Ministers of 1 August 2015, undertook the designing and planning of useful strategies to ensure the resilience of the public administration national IT infrastructure. The goal was to increase the responsiveness, awareness and efficiency of the cybersecurity systems of public administration bodies to prevent the occurrence of events such as accidents or hostile actions aimed at compromising the normal provision of service. The first step was drafting the Guidelines for ICT Security of Public Administration Bodies and its reference within the Minimum ICT Security Measures for Public Administration Bodies document, published in 2016. More recently, as part of the programme for the implementation of the Digital Agenda, AgID launched the Italia Login project through which AgID aims at creating an integrated environment, from the infrastructure to applications, standards and norms, as a basis for the development and delivery of public administration services for citizens and businesses.</p><p>Acknowledging the potential impact of cyberattacks to which public administration bodies may be exposed, in 2018 a risk management methodology was designed and developed, starting from the solutions already in use in the private and public sector both nationally and internationally. The main characteristics are the following:</p><ul><li>Applicability to all public administration bodies (regardless of their size), technological complexity and types of services delivered to businesses, citizens and other public entities; and</li><li>Suitability to be supported by an application tool that can be used by all public administration bodies and integrated with other central IT infrastructures such as Servizi.Gov.it.</li></ul><p>Starting from the second half of 2018, PAC and PAL were involved in the experimentation of the cyber risk self-assessment tool developed by <a href="https://www.sicurezzait.gov.it">AgID</a>. In 2019 and 2020 the number of administrations involved in using the risk assessment tool has consistently grown.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base <a href="https://www.sicurezzait.gov.it">registries</a></h3><p class="subtitle">Base RegistriesAccording to the <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.readthedocs.io/it/latest/doc/04_infrastrutture-immateriali.html#dati-della-pubblica-amministrazione"><em>Piano Triennale</em></a><em> </em>(Three-year plan), Italy has implemented a controlled vocabularies and metadata plan for 17 base registries.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Artificial Intelligence and blockchain</p><p>The MISE established two expert groups on <a href="https://www.mise.gov.it/index.php/it/10-istituzionale/ministero/2038906-intelligenza-artificiale-membri-del-gruppo-di-esperti">AI </a>and <a href="https://www.mise.gov.it/index.php/it/10-istituzionale/ministero/2039024-blockchain-membri-del-gruppo-di-esperti">blockchain</a>. </p><p>In March 2018, the first White Paper on Artificial Intelligence at the Service of Citizens was presented in Rome by the AgID’s <a href="https://ia.italia.it/">IA Task Force</a>.</p><p>The White Paper illustrated the guidelines and recommendations for the sustainable and responsible use of artificial intelligence in the public administration and it represented the first step to connect public administration bodies and the private sector.

The strategy is structured in three parts. The first part includes an assessment of the global, European, and Italian AI markets. The second contains the foundations of the strategy, while the third part brings forward several proposals on AI governance as well as the necessity of an agile and adaptive legislative framework. </p><p>The strategy presents 82 proposals that have been drafted and discussed since the first half of 2019. The original draft has been challenged during a public consultation between August and September 2019 and has eventually been reviewed and updated in February 2020. The work performed over these 18 months resulted in several ambitious proposals tailored to the Italian economy that aim to address both competitiveness and sustainability issues within the European framework for AI. Particularly, the National Strategy on AI outlines:</p><ul><li>10 general recommendations; </li><li>17 specific recommendations on AI for human beings;</li><li>41 specific recommendations on the creation of a productive and reliable ecosystem; </li><li>7 specific recommendations on sustainable development; and</li><li>7 specific recommendations on the implementation of the strategy. </li></ul><p><img src="img/35-628.jpeg" alt="A gavel on a desk

It defined the ANPR as a merger of the Index of National Registries (INA) and the Register of Italian Citizens Residing Abroad (AIRE). Regarding the use of personal data, the DAC mandates that personal data be stored locally and aligned continuously with the ANPR.

Both articles state that public administration bodies need to cooperate with each other to obtain the required information, rather than acquiring it from citizens who are not obliged to provide the same information to the public administration more than once. As a result, the steps undertaken for applying the OOP included the creation of common data models for some databases or base registries, such as the National Directory of Geographic Data (RNDT), and the National Registry of the Resident Population (ANPR). Nonetheless, Italy still had to invest efforts towards applying the principle in a broader scope, and in turn, ensure that public administration bodies exchange data between each other without requesting additional data from citizens or enterprises.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474968"></a>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">Legislative Decree No. 50/2016 </p><p><a href="http://www.normattiva.it/uri-res/N2Ls?urn:nir:stato:decreto.legislativo:2016-04-18;50!vig=">Legislative Decree No. 50 of 18 April 2016</a> amended the previous Public Procurement Code and implemented Directives 2014/23/EU, 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU.</p><p class="subtitle">Public Procurement Code</p><p>Adopted on 12 April 2006, the <a href="http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/testi/06163dl.htm">Public Procurement Code</a> implemented <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0017:EN:HTML">Directive 2004/17/EC</a> coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors, as well as <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004L0018:EN:HTML">Directive 2004/18/EC</a> on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works, public supplies and public service contracts.

It is a community of developers who design and develop Italian digital public services.</p><p>The website was created to simplify and improve interaction between developers and the public administration, starting with some important projects such as the <a href="https://www.anpr.interno.it/portale/">ANPR</a>, the National Registry of the Resident Population, or the <a href="https://www.spid.gov.it/">SPID</a>, the digital public identity management system. Until now, with rare exceptions, the central public administration limited itself to drafting laws and regulations in a non-technical bureaucratic language without any tools or initiatives to support the developers involved in building and integrating software. Developers Italia wants to fill this gap. Developers Italia wants to build a community starting from the basics: re-writing the documentation in a technical language, using as a publishing platform the open-source project <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">Read The Docs</a>. By providing a development environment, examples, and SDKs for the most common languages and frameworks, the platform provides direct support via the <a href="https://forum.italia.it/">forum</a>, built on top of the open-source project <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> and already accessible online, instead of a helpdesk accessible only by phone.</p><p class="subtitle">Guidelines on the Acquisition and Reuse of Software for Public Administration Bodies</p><p>The circular on <a href="https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/lg-acquisizione-e-riuso-software-per-pa-docs/it/bozza/">Guidelines on the Acquisition and Reuse of Software for Public Administration Bodies</a> was drawn up by a working group made up of members of AgID and the Digital Transformation Team. They implement the provisions of Articles 68 – Comparative Analysis of Solutions – and 69 – Reuse of Solutions and Open Standards – of the DAC, and in accordance with Article 71, Technical Rules.</p><p>The purpose of the document, which replaced the previous circular No. 63/2013, entitled Guidelines for Comparative Assessment, provided for by Article 68 of Legislative Decree No. 82 of 7 March 2005, (DAC and its annexes), was to facilitate public administration bodies in the acquisition and reuse of software through the use of the open-source paradigm.</p><p>In line with the provisions of the circular, and the Three-Year Plan for Information Technology in the Public Administration, AgID provided a repository (archive) of the source code, which brought together the open-source components that could be used by all public administration bodies and the community of developers working for them.</p><p>The guidelines are also based on the Three-Year Plan, which includes the following strategic objectives:</p><ul><li>Sharing indications and software components that allow for the reduction in the costs of implementing new digital products, and promoting reuse and interoperability;</li><li>Spreading the open-source paradigm, facilitating the establishment of a community of applications and software components developers useful for the public administration.</li></ul><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">Public System for Digital Identity Management</p><p>The <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/agenda-digitale/infrastrutture-architetture/spid">Public System for Digital Identity Management</a> (SPID) is an electronic identification means that certifies the digital identity of citizens and businesses. SPID can be used to access and enjoy all the online services of the public administration with a single digital identity (username and password) that can be used from computers, tablets and smartphones. Italian citizens and businesses can use their SPID credentials to access public services in other Member States. Cooperation between the public and the private sectors plays a core role in the path toward mutually recognised national systems.</p><p>As at January 2020, there were 5 736 193 SPID identities, nine active digital identity providers, and 4 161 active administrations.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic ID Card</p><p>The Italian electronic ID card (CIE) project was launched in 2001. After two test phases, it was rolled out across the country and distributed to citizens older than 15. In December 2018, AgID started the notification process to all Member States in an attempt to make CIEs usable within all the European public administration bodies, as it is the case for the SPID. This process was finalised in the first half of 2019. The Italian electronic ID card is complementary to SPID.</p><p>The Italian eID card comprises a microchip, an optical memory and an ICAO machine readable zone for the use of the card as a travel document. It contains a set of personal data, including the holder’s tax code, blood type and fingerprint scans. The personal data, the biometric key and the digital signature are only stored on the card. In accordance with data protection legislation, these data are not kept on any central database and can only be released and used if the holder gives his/her permission by inserting a PIN code. The cardholder’s fingerprint template is stored in both the microchip and the optical memory. The microchip makes online identification possible and enables transactions between citizens and providers, including ePayments.</p><p>From April 2017 to December 2018, all Italian municipalities activated the CIE system. Thanks to CIE, Italian citizens can travel within the EU and access online services provided by the Italian public administration.</p><p class="subtitle">Certified Electronic Mail</p><p>In 2005, <a href="http://www.edscuola.it/archivio/norme/decreti/dpr068_05.pdf">Decree (DPR) No. 68</a> defined the characteristics of a new electronic delivery service (<a href="http://www.openpec.org/eng/index.shtml"><em>Posta Elettronica Certificata - PEC</em></a>), granting it legal value.</p><p>PEC ensured the recognition of the sender; the integrity of a sent message (by digital signature); the absence of delivery refusal; the matching between the delivery receipt and the message sent by the user.</p><p>The eGovernment Code introduced the PEC in government processes. Public administration bodies were requested to set up and publish at least one PEC address.</p><p class="subtitle">National Services Card</p><p>In order to enable citizens to securely access eGovernment services even before the widespread dissemination of electronic ID cards, the Italian government developed the <a href="http://www.progettocns.it/index.aspx?AspxAutoDetectCookieSupport=1">National Services Card (CNS)</a>. It is a smart card that allows for the secured identification of citizens online. The only difference between this card and the eID card is that the former lacks additional security elements, such as the laser band, the holograms, etc. Therefore, it does not constitute a ‘proof of identity’ or a travel document.</p><p>The card was used to sign electronic documents due to its flexibility in administration to‑citizen (A2C) services, both at national and local level.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Passport (ePass)</p><p>Since 2009, Italy has been gradually entering phase II of the implementation of European Union’s <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R2252:EN:HTML">Council Regulation (EC) No. 2252/2004</a> of 13 December 2004, on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States. Besides containing the holder’s facial image, the <a href="https://www.passaportonline.poliziadistato.it/">current version of the passport</a> also contains fingerprints. Police stations and headquarters collect the fingerprints contained in the document and store them in encrypted mode on an invisible microchip. Once the passport is issued, the fingerprints are deleted from the central archive and remain solely on the electronic passport. The new passport is hence deemed more secure with regard to counterfeiting. It becomes a primary identification tool since fingerprints are unique. The fingerprints are collected for all passport applicants above 12 years of age.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Innovative Procurement Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://appaltinnovativi.gov.it/">Innovative Procurement Portal</a> was created according to the provisions of action line 75, Chapter 10 of the 2019-2021 Three-Year Plan for Information Technology in the Public Administration, with the aim of promoting the use of innovation contracts, to support Italian public administration bodies in carrying out procurement procedures, and to match the supply and demand of innovative solutions.
