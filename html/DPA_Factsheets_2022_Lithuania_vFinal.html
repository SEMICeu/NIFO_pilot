The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-186.png" alt="35-186.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Lithuania in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-220.x-emf" alt="35-220.x-emf" /></p><p><a id="_Hlk104196148"></a>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Lithuania’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Areas of improvement are concentrated in the Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 7 (Inclusion and accessibility) and 9 ((Multilingualism), for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the use of national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies aligned with the EIF (Principle 1 – Recommendation 1), the implementation of e-accessibility specifications that are widely recognised (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14), and the inclusion of  multilingualism support on information systems (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p><img src="img/35-234.x-emf" alt="35-234.x-emf" />                                                          Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Lithuanian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall good performance. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance and semantic interoperability. More specifically, the score of 1 for Lithuania in Recommendations 21, 23 and 24, all referring to the need to have process and catalogues for standards and work standardisation, lowers the overall governance interoperability result for Lithuania. Similarly, the country should further support the establishment of sector-specific and cross-sectoral communities that aim to create open information specifications and encourage relevant communities to share their results on national and European platforms (Recommendation 32).</p><p><img src="img/35-245.x-emf" alt="35-245.x-emf" />                                                          Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Lithuania’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model, internal and external information sources and services, performing above the European average in the latter, base registries and open data. However, some improvements could be made in implementing recommendations related to catalogues as well as in the area of security and privacy. Precisely, the lack of trust services according to the Regulation on eID (Recommendation 47) hinders the overall Lithuanian score on the security and privacy area.</p><p>Additional information on Lithuania’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1035577"></a><a id="_Toc1474948"></a>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity:</strong> indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services:</strong> indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers:</strong> indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The legal amendments address obligations on opening relevant data, and seek to increase reuse of publicly funded information and to bring the legislative framework up to date with the advances in digital technologies. Amendments to the Law on the Right to Receive Information and Reuse of Data entered into force in July 2021, transposing the provisions of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information, and establishing a data opening model which obliges institutions to inventory their data to know what data are owned by the State and open data on user demand. The data opening model also establishes a centralised data opening scheme, which should significantly speed up the data opening process.

Appropriate legislation was passed, responsible institutions were selected to manage various aspects of security (electronic information security, cybersecurity, personal data security, etc.), and military and civilian responsibilities were apportioned. However, after several years of operation of said legal and institutional system, the Lithuanian authorities concluded that the functions of the country’s institutions responsible for cyber and electronic security overlapped and that public sector financial resources and cybersecurity personnel were deployed inefficiently. </p><p>The Lithuanian government decided to consolidate all cyber responsibilities under the <a href="https://kam.lt/en/title.html">Ministry of National Defence</a> in order to create a single window for everyone, to ensure the sharing of Lithuania’s cyber experience with others and, finally, to strive for the best solution regarding civil-military synergies in cybersecurity. In order to finally consolidate the management of cybersecurity and electronic security, amendments to the Law on Cybersecurity and the Law on the Management of State Information Resources were made and adopted on 21 November 2017. The Ministry of National Defence took on the leadership role for Lithuania’s overall cyber and electronic security from the beginning of 2018. A unified <a href="https://www.cert.lt/en/">National Cybersecurity Centre</a> became the main computer emergency response team (CERT) that brings together the Lithuanian public, private, governmental and military spheres. </p><p>In 2019, the Ministry of National Defence established a governmental network, detached from a public internet and encompassing State institutions having functions related to mobilisation. This will ensure that even in the event of a conflict, fundamental State institutions will remain protected and able to exchange information. </p><p>In addition to national initiatives, Lithuania, represented by the Ministry of National Defence, is a lead nation of the EU’s Permanent Structured Cooperation in Security and Defence Project Cyber Rapid Response Teams and Mutual Assistance in Cybersecurity. Together with eleven other EU Member States, Lithuania is creating a common capability to respond to cyberattacks – a multinational team with a well-developed cyber toolkit, which will be able to support Member States in times of need.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474981"></a>Subnational (federal, regional and local)</h2><p class="subtitle">Association of Local Authorities in Lithuania</p><p>The <a href="http://www.lsa.lt/">Association of Local Authorities in Lithuania (ALAL)</a> is a non-profit organisation in the form of a legal entity which represents the common interests of its members - i.e. local authorities – before all State authorities, and foreign and international organisations of local authorities.

The GovTech Lab helps the public sector institutions and start-ups work together to prototype innovative digital solutions. To that end, it runs a structured programme, called GovTech Challenge Series, designed to solve public sector challenges that do not have a clear answer but have a potential to foster the creation of innovative digital solutions, co-created with start-ups and SME’s. </p><p>Overall, in 2021 the GovTech Lab dealt with around 50 challenges, organised 20 events that were attended by over 2 500 ecosystem members, consulted 30 start-ups and companies, helped 18 international GovTech scale-ups explore Lithuania as a potential scaling destination, and co-organised 4 hackathons to foster new talent.</p><p>Additionally, Lithuania’s latest endeavour to confirm its trend-setting role in the GovTech space and strengthen the GovTech Lab was the launch of a newly funded GovTech Sandbox, i.e. a programme for public sector entities to get funding to pilot around 40 GovTech solutions via an innovative procurement method – the design contest. Traditional procurement methods often do not suit smaller companies and start-ups, whereas design contests can be easily accessible for them. As a result of each design contest, start-ups and innovative companies received monetary prizes and follow-up contracts of up to EUR 53 000 to develop each GovTech pilot. Overall, almost EUR 2 million were invested in GovTech solutions. Many of these innovative solutions were created by the end of 2021, including a smart mental health assistant for the prevention of relapses, a tool for monitoring, analysing and evaluating the activities of Vilnius educational institutions, a smart solution that will open the City of Panevėžys’ industry to students and tourists, and many other solutions. </p><p><img src="img/35-725.jpeg" alt="A high angle view of a road

The ESPBI IS strives to ensure a higher level of patient awareness about health and a more effective use of available resources for the provision of healthcare services, and seeks to base those services on modern technologies.</p><p>The structure of the ESPBI IS based on a repository database, which consists of separate databases of patient electronic health records (EHRs), medical devices, classifiers, medical images, ePrescriptions, as well as reports and statistical information. </p><p>Before the ESPBI IS was launched, there was no central or unified national database of patient medical records in Lithuania. The ESPBI IS was created as a single data centre which stores the medical records of each resident (patient) and also allows integrating data from all internal information systems of healthcare institutions into a unified system. Such integration allows for the creation, storage and transfer of EHRs according to the ‘one patient one EHR’ principle. For the smaller healthcare institutions that do not own internal information systems, a special eHealth portal was developed. Authorised healthcare professionals can now provide the required patient data to the central EHR database or other ESPBI IS databases through their computers. This means that patient data can be transferred to the ESPBI IS either directly via a special eHealth portal or by integrating the internal information systems of larger healthcare institutions.</p><p>Since mid-2017, the number of EHRs, including ePrescriptions, has grown significantly. All the healthcare providers that have contracts with the Health Insurance Fund are connected to the central eHealth system – the ESPBI IS. These healthcare providers serve 100% of Lithuania’s patients. In addition, all pharmacies are connected to the central eHealth system and can dispense medicines based on ePrescriptions. In December 2021, the increase in the ESPBI IS usage was significant – the ESPBI IS served 100% of insured patients who are registered with a primary healthcare institution that has a contract with the Health Insurance Fund, 99.7% of all reimbursed drugs were prescribed electronically, and 100% of referrals, 96% of in-patient recuperation, 100% of out-patient descriptions, 100% of child’s birth certificates and medical death certificates and 97% of driver’s medical certificates were provided to the ESPBI IS. Overall, in 2021 more than 88 million medical records were submitted to the ESPBI IS, compared with a total of over 38 million in 2019.</p><p>The data stored in the ESPBI IS are also accessible to patients via a special national <a href="http://www.esveikata.lt/">internet portal</a>.

This solution ensures higher transparency of public sector solutions and procedures, and openness and accountability vis-à-vis society, while decreasing the risk of corruption and saving money.</p><p class="subtitle">Cash Restrictions Information System</p><p>The <a href="https://www.registrucentras.lt/p/1026">Cash Restrictions Information System</a> is an automatically operating information system which enables any institution holding the right to forced recovery to place orders with credit institutions to write off cash and impose restrictions in a uniform approach. The system ensures the sequence of write-offs in accordance with the priority to satisfy the claims and distributes the debtor’s funds proportionally to the institutions holding the right to forced recovery. The system allows to control the processes related to debtor cash restrictions and/or write-offs and ensures effective data exchange among those participating in the cash restrictions process.</p><p class="subtitle">Information System on Participants of Legal Entities</p><p>The <a href="http://www.registrucentras.lt/p/1108">Information System on Participants of Legal Entities (JADIS)</a> was developed to collect and store data about participants of legal entities by using information technology tools, and to provide data to the natural and legal entities having the right to receive them.</p><p>JADIS has been operational since 2014, and currently collects and stores data about shareholders of private limited-liability companies, members of small partnerships, part‑owners of public institutions, members of cooperative companies (cooperatives), members and shareholders of farming enterprises, general members of general partnerships, general and limited members of limited partnerships, and part-owners of charity and sponsorship funds, which are non-governmental organisations.</p><p>JANGIS is a newly created sub-system of beneficial owners of JADIS, which is in operation from the beginning of 2022. Information about beneficial owners of legal entities (which are obligated by the Law to provide data) is stored in this sub-system.</p><p>The Law provides for an obligation of all legal entities incorporated in the Republic of Lithuania (except for legal entities whose sole member is the state or a municipality), including collective investment undertakings, to obtain, update and store accurate information on their beneficial owners – their name, surname, date of birth, personal number, the state, which issued the identity document, place of residence, ownership rights held by them and their scope (the number of shares expressed as a percentage and the number of voting rights expressed as a percentage) or other rights of control (the chair of the board, board member, director, senior manager, other position and the number of transferred voting rights expressed as a percentage).</p><p>Currently, legal entities of all legal forms whose beneficial owners are natural persons who directly and indirectly control them must submit data on the beneficial owners to the Centre of Registers. Investment companies and investment funds will be able to provide data from July this year.</p><p>Data on beneficial owners of legal entities is provided to JANGIS electronically through the Self Service of the Centre of Registers.</p><p>Data on beneficial owners shall be provided to state institutions or agencies and municipal institutions or agencies, credit and financial institutions, representatives of mass media, natural persons and legal entities in cases provided for by laws, as well as to the general public.</p><p>The availability of such data aims at greater transparency and public confidence. It will also help to combat the misuse of legal persons for money laundering or terrorist financing, ensure the transparency of the structures of beneficial owners and legal entities, and affect the circumstances for the emergence of a shadow economy in the country. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Trust Services</p><p>There are four qualified trust service providers established and supervised in Lithuania: </p><ul><li>The Identity Documents Personalisation Centre under the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Lithuania (issuance of qualified electronic signature certificates);</li><li>The Centre of Registries – a State enterprise (issuance of qualified electronic signature certificates and qualified electronic seal certificates, and creation of qualified electronic time stamps);</li><li>The JSC BalTstamp (creation of qualified electronic time stamps); and</li><li>The JSC Dokobit (qualified validation services for qualified electronic signatures and seals).</li></ul><p>The Estonian qualified trust service provider SK ID Solutions (issuing qualified electronic signature certificates) is also active on the Lithuanian market and issues qualified electronic signature certificates with mobile SIM cards and a Smart-ID app. In 2020, SK ID Solutions provided more than 1 462 300 qualified electronic signature certificates for Lithuanian citizens.</p><p>As of December 2020, there were more than 2 122 800 valid qualified electronic signature certificates issued to Lithuanian citizens (more than 660 400 of them issued by Lithuanian qualified trust service providers). </p><p>It is also worth mentioning that according to the latest market overview, prepared by the Communications Regulatory Authority, usage of electronic signature is growing steadily (2014 – 6% citizens using electronic signature, 2017 – 14%, 2018 – 18%, 2019 – 23%, 2020 – 35%).</p><p class="subtitle">ePassports</p><p>Pursuant to <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R2252:EN:HTML">Council Regulation (EC) No. 2252/2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by the Member States</a>, on 8 August 2008 Lithuania started issuing <a href="http://www.dokumentai.lt/">passports containing biometric data</a> (facial image), secured by basic access control.
