This pioneering strategy sets out the instruments that will reduce the carbon and environmental footprint of the ICT sector and help reap the benefits of digitisation. More in general, the purpose of the national Climate and Environment Strategy for the ICT Sector is to promote ecologically sustainable digitisation and support the achievement of climate and environmental objectives. </p><p>The strategy approaches the climate and environment aspects of the ICT sector from two perspectives. On the one hand, communication networks, data centres and smart devices consume electricity and materials. The ICT sector consumes an estimated 4‑10% of global electric power and gives rise to some 3–5% of greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, the ICT sector has a great deal of potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors, such as transport. For instance, digital services enable intelligent transport control and make public transport more attractive by streamlining vehicle changes. Also, the coronavirus pandemic has shown in practice how teleworking and teleconferencing can replace passenger transportation.</p><p>The strategy will be implemented by a wide range of parties, both public and private. The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency (Traficom) will monitor implementation of the strategy in partnership with stakeholders.

The <a href="http://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/161688/41_19_Leading the way into the age of artificial intelligence.pdf">final report of the programme</a>, submitted on 14 March 2019, included eleven themes in total as key factors with recommended guidelines on how to utilise artificial intelligence in Finland in an ethical manner. The report describes the results achieved during the programme period and provides a basis for the next stage in the years to come.</p><p>An extensive group of influencers and experts from different sectors of society, including business and industry, took part in formulating the Artificial Intelligence Programme. The approach adopted was called a network of networks; the idea was to quickly and flexibly include many different interest groups in the preparation work. The programme and its networks have taken Finland towards the age of artificial intelligence through the following key actions: </p><ul><li>Enhance business competitiveness through the use of AI;</li><li>Effectively utilise data in all sectors;</li><li>Ensure that AI can be adopted more quickly and easily; </li><li>Ensure top-level expertise and attract top experts;</li><li>Make bold decisions and investments;</li><li>Build the world’s best public services;</li><li>Establish new models for collaboration; </li><li>Make Finland a forerunner in the age of artificial intelligence;</li><li>Prepare for artificial intelligence to change the nature of work; </li><li>Steer AI development into a trust-based, human-centric direction;</li><li>Prepare for security challenges.</li></ul><p>Based on the achievements and lessons learned, the final report presented key measures to be introduced during the next 12 months concerning, for example, clarifying the rules of how data is used, continuing of AI accelerator style operations and ensuring a human-centric adoption of AI in the public sector. In addition, the programme provided a vision of Finland in the age of artificial intelligence in 2025, a vision of a country that is competitive, able to attract talent and with highly-educated population consisting of well-informed and independent citizens.</p><p class="subtitle">National Artificial Intelligence Programme AuroraAI</p><p>The <a href="https://vm.fi/en/national-artificial-intelligence-programme-auroraai">AuroraAI programme</a> (2020–2022) is based on the strategic objective of building a dynamic and thriving Finland, as expressed in the Government Programme. The Government Programme states that the secure and ethically sustainable development of the AuroraAI network will be continued in order to make everyday life and business easier. The Programme was launched by the Ministry of Finance on 6 February 2020 to continue the development carried out by the preliminary study of 2018–2019. AuroraAI programme was one of the key recommendations of the Finnish Artificial Intelligence Programme on building the world’s best public services by using artificial intelligence solutions. </p><p>Scheduled until the end of 2022, the programme lays the foundation for using artificial intelligence to bring services and people together in a better way in different events and situations of life. The AuroraAI network aims to enable smooth interaction and communication between different services and platforms as the AI Programme’s report of 2017 suggested. Breaking down silos that continue to affect parts of the current service provision, the AuroraAI network aims to enable AI to facilitate interaction between services and to improve the match between users and public services while tackling inefficiency and resource waste. The purpose of AuroraAI is to create the technical conditions that enable information exchange and interoperability between different services and platforms.</p><p>In addition to the AuroraAI network, the programme is developing a service model to arrange public services in a way that they can support people in their life events and organisations in their business activities, in collaboration with service providers in other sectors. The third main product of the programme is the new skills and competence development programme that will be set up to support the service model during the deployment phase and later on. </p><p>The aim of the programme is to deploy the AuroraAI network and the service model for different life situations and events by the end of 2022.</p><p><img src="img/35-440.jpeg" alt="35-440.jpeg" /></p><p>	 Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><p>4</p><h1><a id="_Toc36796622"></a>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474962"></a>Specific legislation on digital public administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Information Management in Public Administration Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2019/20190906">Information Management in Public Administration Act (906/2019)</a> entered into force on 1 January 2020.
