The Law increased the scope of information intended for re-use, including libraries, museums and archives that accounted for a significant part of the public sector information resources, in particular upon the increase in digital materials as a result of implementation of digitalisation projects. Therefore, these cultural heritage resources have a huge innovation potential for re-use in such sectors as education and tourism. The new Law established the conditions for the open licence to use the public sector information based on the Creative Commons License, which enables an information recipient to publish the information received, without obtaining an institution‘s consent, by any method including making it public online or by means of other electronic communications networks, reproducing it in any format or by any method, translating it into other languages, adapting, processing or re-making otherwise, distributing or providing (transmitting) to third parties. These activities would be subjected to minimal requirements only, for example, the requirement to specify the source and date of the information received.

The portal is the internet gateway to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania that provides swift and easy access to information on the Cabinet of Ministers and the work of Government institutions (currently 106 institutions), as well as a possibility to become actively involved by using eDemocracy services.</p><p>SIRIP created the structure and transferred into electronic space the 65 most important services provided by the country's municipalities and 29 services and 111 electronic applications for provision of services to 14 state institutions. </p><p>The implemented solutions guarantee a convenient and easy receipt of services of the state and municipal institutions by residents, businesses and foreign nationals. It increases transparency and efficiency of state and municipal institutions, agencies and companies while new electronic services reduce time and costs for design, provision and service receipt. </p><p>The SIRIP portal is common to nearly all important public and administrative services in Lithuania.  Services can be combined or complex, accessible to a user in one click.  </p><p>This multifunctional, continuously improved, user-friendly SIRIP system allows quick new electronic services and ensures mutual accessibility between governmental institutions and residents.</p><p>In July 2018, a project of further SIRIP development was initiated. The main goal was to increase quality of services in SIRIP environment and to create four additional complex public electronic services based on life events.</p><p>SIRIP currently unites 650 institutions, provides access to over 613 services and has more than 2.4 million unique visitors each year.

SSDCN is the national network (national domain) for the EU’s pan-European administrative network TESTA, built on the basis of the State Institutions Computer Network (SICN). It was originally developed between 1994-1998. The state enterprise <em>Infostruktūra</em>, supervised by the Ministry of the Interior, is the service provider for SSDCN. The SSDCN network currently covers all Lithuania and connects 487 state institutions plus another 396 institutions on a dial-up connection (the latter include health centres, libraries, etc.). All main state registers are also connected to the SSDCN. According to the amendments to the Law on Management of State Information Resources on 20 December 2018, the Ministry of National Defence plans to establish a Governmental Network in 2019. This Governmental Network will be detached from a public internet, encompassing state institutions, which have functions related to mobilisation. The Network will be operated by <em>Infostruktūra</em>. Users of the Network will be established by Governmental Decree. The accomplished initiative of Ministry of National Defence will ensure that even in the time of conflict fundamental institutions are protected and able to exchange information. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">ESPBI IS</p><p>The Electronic Health Services and Cooperation Infrastructure Information System (<a href="http://www.esveikata.lt/">ESPBI IS</a>), is a national system of organisational, technical, and software measures that developed a centralised database of health data and enabled the exchange of such data among patients, healthcare professionals, and institutions. </p><p>ESPBI IS strives to ensure a higher level of patien’ awareness about their own health, a more effective use of available resources for provision of healthcare services, and help to base those services on modern technologies.</p><p>The structure of the ESPBI IS is based on a repository database, which consists of separate databases of patients’ electronic health records (EHRs), medical devices, classifiers, medical images, ePrescriptions, as well as reports and statistical information. </p><p>Before ESPBI IS was launched, there was no central or unified national database of patient's medical records in Lithuania. ESPBI IS was created as a single data centre which stores the medical records of each resident (patient) and also allows integrating data from all internal Information Systems (IS) of healthcare institutions into a unified system. Such integration allows for the creation, storage and transfer of EHRs according to the principle ‘one patient one EHR'. For the smaller healthcare institutions that do not own internal IS, a special eHealth portal was developed. Authorised healthcare professionals can now provide required the patient data to the central database of EHR or other databases of ESPBI IS through their computers. This means that patient data can be transferred to ESPBI IS either directly through a special eHealth portal or by the integration of internal IS of largest healthcare institutions.</p><p>Since mid-2017, the number of electronic medical records, including electronic prescriptions, has grown significantly. In March 2019, about 850 (out of 900) healthcare institutions were connected to the central eHealth system (ESPBI IS) and have sent at least one document electronically to the central eHealth system. All pharmacies are connected to the central eHealth system and can dispense medicines based on electronic prescriptions. In April 2019, 91% of all reimbursed drugs were prescribed electronically, while all birth and death certificates were issued electronically.</p><p>The data stored in the ESPBI IS is also accessible for the patients via special national <a href="http://www.esveikata.lt">internet portal</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">Social Support Family Information System (SPIS)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.spis.lt/">Social Support Family Information System (SPIS)</a> is an information system operating under cooperation agreements between the Ministry of Social Security and Labour and all municipalities of the country. The purpose of SPIS is to uniformly record and accumulate information on social assistance provided in municipalities (social benefits and compensations, social support for pupils, social services, activities carried out in the field of protection of the rights of the child, etc.), to analyse this information by municipalities, types of support and beneficiaries. as well as preventing support from several municipalities at the same time.</p><p>Via SPIS the residents can use a set of electronic public services, i.e. the residents can submit the following requests electronically:</p><ul><li>Grant a lump sum to a child born or adopted;</li><li>Grant a child allowance;</li><li>Grant a lump-sum benefit to a pregnant woman;</li><li>Allow more than one child to receive the benefit at the same time;</li><li>Pay for the care of the child of the learner or student</li><li>Provide care/welfare benefit;</li><li>Allocate a targeted supplement to care/welfare benefits;</li><li>Grant social benefits;</li><li>Reimbursement of housing heating costs, drinking water and hot water costs;</li><li>Grant a funeral allowance;</li><li>Earmark targeted compensation for care/assistance costs;</li><li>Target compensation for nursing costs;</li><li>To allocate targeted compensation to the person who has been in charge;</li><li>Allow children under 18 to receive benefits.

Information about enforcement files, legal proceedings executed, and enforcement measures taken enable the Ministry of Justice, which supervises activities of judicial officers, to control activities of the judicial officers. </p><p>The electronic enforcement file portal <a href="http://www.antstoliai.lt">www.antstoliai.lt</a> enables citizens and businesses to participate in the enforcement process: to get familiar with own enforcement files or enforcement files of the authorised person, general and financial information, to look through the procedural documents, to form and submit applications by electronic means on submission of the enforcement document and other applications of free form to the judicial officers.  </p><p>The service of electronic forced auctions allows the bailiffs and bankruptcy administrators to announce forced auctions of the sold property by electronic means. This service is used for the electronic sale of the state-owned and municipal property organised by the State Enterprise <em>Turto Bankas</em>, municipalities and other institutions. This solution ensures higher transparency of public sector solutions and procedures, openness and accountability to the society, decreases the risk of corruption and saves money.</p><p class="subtitle">Cash Restrictions Information System</p><p>The Cash Restrictions Information System is an automatically operating information system, which enables any institution holding the right to forced recovery to place orders to credit institutions to write off cash and impose restrictions in a uniform approach. The system ensures the sequence of write-offs in accordance with the priority to satisfy the claims and distributes the debtor’s funds proportionally to the institutions holding the right to forced recovery. The system allows controlling the processes related to debtor’s cash restrictions and/or write-offs and ensures effective data exchange among those participating in the cash restrictions process.</p><p class="subtitle">Information System of Legal Entities Participants (JADIS)</p><p><a href="http://www.registrucentras.lt/p/1108">JADIS</a> is developed to collect and store data about legal entities participants by using information technology tools and to provide data to the natural and legal entities having the right to receive it.</p><p>JADIS has been operational since 2014, and currently collects and stores data about shareholders of private limited-liability companies, members of small partnerships, part owners of public institutions, members of cooperatives companies (cooperatives), members and shareholders of agricultural companies.</p><p>The main functions of the JADIS are as follows:</p><ul><li>To enter data about participants of legal entities and form the lists of participants;</li><li>To collect, process and manage the data about legal entities participants;</li><li>To provide data and documents to natural and legal entities in the manner prescribed in the JADIS Regulations;</li><li>To systemise, analyse and summarise the JADIS data; </li><li>To exchange data with other institutions.</li></ul><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Trust Services</p><p>There are three qualified trust service providers established and supervised in Lithuania: </p><ul><li>Identity Documents Personalisation Centre under the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Lithuania (issuance of qualified electronic signature certificates);</li><li>State enterprise The Centre of Registers (issuance of qualified electronic signature certificates, qualified electronic seal certificates and creation of qualified electronic time stamps);</li><li>JSC BalTstamp (creation of qualified electronic time stamps).</li></ul><p>Estonian qualified trust service provider SK ID Solutions (issuing qualified electronic signature certificates) is active in Lithuanian market and issues qualified electronic signature certificates with mobile SIM cards and Smart-ID app.</p><p>As of December 2018, there were more than 926 000 valid qualified electronic signature certificates issued to Lithuanian citizens (more than 688 000 of them issued by Lithuanian qualified trust service providers). </p><p>It is also worth mentioning that according to the latest market overview, prepared by Communications Regulatory Authority, usage of electronic signature grows constantly (2014 – 6% citizens using electronic signature, 2017 – 14%, 2018 – 18%).</p><p class="subtitle">ePassports</p><p>Pursuant to EU Council regulation no. <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R2252:EN:HTML">2252/2004</a> on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by the Member States, on 8 August 2008, Lithuania started issuing <a href="http://www.dokumentai.lt/">passports containing biometric data</a> (facial image), secured by basic access control.
