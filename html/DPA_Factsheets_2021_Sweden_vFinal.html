The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-126.png" alt="35-126.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main components (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Sweden in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-135.jpeg" alt="35-135.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Sweden’s results in Scoreboard 1 shows an overall good implementation of the EIF principles, despite the lack of data for the Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility). Sweden scores above the European average for the Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and meets the European average for every other principle, with the exception of the Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency), which is below the European average with a score of 1. This lower performance in the implementation of this principle indicates that Swedish public administrations could improve their evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits (Principle 12 - Recommendation 19).  </p><p><img src="img/35-137.jpeg" alt="35-137.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Swedish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows a discrepant performance.

However, Sweden reaches a mid-lower performance in the areas of legal interoperability with a score of 2 and interoperability governance with a score of 1. More specifically, the score of 1 for Sweden in Recommendation 20, stating that a holistic governance of interoperability activities should be ensured across administrative levels and sectors, in Recommendation 22, on public administrations’ use of a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assessing and selecting standards and specifications, and in Recommendation 23, addressing the consultation of relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level when procuring and developing ICT solutions, lowers the overall result in interoperability governance for Sweden.</p><p><img src="img/35-142.jpeg" alt="35-142.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Sweden’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of all recommendations. In line with the European average, Sweden reaches the maximal score of 4 on the implementation of recommendations assessing open data, base registries, internal information sources and services and the conceptual model. The high performance in external and information sources and services indicates that Swedish public administrations are effectively using external information sources and services while developing public services. In order to get a maximal score, Sweden could improve its catalogues of public services, open data and interoperable solutions, as well as increase the number of trust services to ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services.  </p><p>Additional information on Sweden’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The strategy explained how the digitisation policy contributed to competitiveness, full employment, and economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development in the society. The strategy set the focus on the government’s digitisation policy.</p><p>To achieve the overall objective of Sweden of becoming a world leader in harnessing the opportunities of digital transformation, the strategy contained five goals: </p><ul><li><strong>Digital skills:</strong> enhancing citizens’ digital skills, so as to enable them to actively participate in the digital transformation;</li><li><strong>Digital security:</strong> increasing digital security, and thus citizens’ trust and confidence in using digital services;</li><li><strong>Digital innovation:</strong> fostering digital innovation by creating the competitive conditions for the development and spread of new or improved products and services of value to people and businesses;</li><li><strong>Digital leadership:</strong> improving digital leadership, which entails better governance, but also measurement and follow-up activities; and</li><li><strong>Digital infrastructure:</strong> reinforcing the digital infrastructure, such as broadband, which is crucial for transmitting data.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Digital First – A Basic Principle </p><p><a id="_Hlk37059209"></a>Digital first is a principle applied within the public sector. The government has made the assessment that <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/4ad5fb/contentassets/c689564aa19c4d29bcebb1c037a2e37b/utgiftsomrade-2-samhallsekonomi-och-finansforvaltning.pdf">digital should be the first choice</a> in public administration activities and in contacts with private individuals and businesses. Digital first means that the public administration, when appropriate, should choose digital solutions when designing its operations. At the same time, the protection of security-sensitive activities, the security of information and the protection of personal privacy must be ensured. With this in mind, getting in touch digitally with Swedish public authorities should be easy. Furthermore, information should only be provided once, if possible. Public administration should be effective, collaborate, and reuse information, tasks and common solutions whenever possible and appropriate. An <a href="https://www.digg.se/4aefd7/globalassets/dokument/publicerat/publikationer/sveriges-digitala-forvaltning-2020.pdf">analysis and assessment of the status of the digitisation of Sweden’s public administration</a> is published annually. </p><p class="subtitle">Putting the Citizen at the Centre - A Digital Services Strategy</p><p>The Swedish government strategy for collaborative digital services in government administration, ‘<a href="https://www.regeringen.se/informationsmaterial/2015/04/med-medborgaren-i-centrum/">Putting the Citizen at the Centre</a>’, was launched in December 2012. This strategy described how the Swedish government planned to further strengthen the ability of government agencies to work together in delivering digital services. More common digital services in the daily lives of both citizens and businesses have been further simplified. These digital services shall be developed in a user-centric way: simple, secure to use and easily accessible to everyone. Innovation has been enhanced by making it easier to find and use reusable public information and digital services with interfaces that can be operated by other systems. The publication of public sector information on the internet and the use of social media have promoted both transparency and citizen involvement. Quality and efficiency in government administration have been increased through standardised information management, better information security and digitised processes. Such internal efficiency in developing digital services must always be conditional on the protection of personal privacy and the need for confidentiality. The above-mentioned objectives have formed the basis of the Swedish government’s coordinated and overriding development of inter‑agency cross-sectorial projects. </p><p class="subtitle">Development for the Digital Age - A New Strategy for Local and Regional Governments</p><p>In 2019, the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions (SALAR) adopted a <a href="https://skr.se/naringslivarbetedigitalisering/digitalisering/strategifordigitalutveckling.6728.html">new strategy</a> for digital government, aiming to align efforts related to digital development in SALAR, the Swedish municipalities and regions, as well as in the SALAR groups <a href="https://www.sklkommentus.se/">SKL Kommentus</a> and <a href="https://www.inera.se/">Inera</a>.

As a follow-up, the <a href="https://www.nordicinnovation.org/mobility">Nordic Mobility Action Programme 2019–2021</a> was adopted at a meeting of the Ministers for Nordic Cooperation in Reykjavik on 7 February 2019, the first meeting under the Icelandic Presidency of the Nordic Council of Ministers. The mobility programme, which has been extended to 2024, provides for higher funding for a range of projects and programmes that support mobility for individuals, and a list of measures that promote freedom of movement and Nordic integration for companies and individuals. </p><p>Cross-border electronic identification (eID) is one of the key enablers in this programme. The Nordic-Baltic eID Project (NOBID), which run from 2018 to 2020, had the aim of speeding up the implementation of the regulation on electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS regulation) in the Nordics and Baltics. In addition, the Nordic-Baltic cooperation on eID was on the agenda at the Nordic Prime Ministers’ meeting on 31 October 2018. The Prime Ministers supported the eID cooperation, securing access to trusted digital services across borders. </p><p class="subtitle">eID for Employees</p><p>The possibility to use employee eIdentifications in external services outside of the employee’s organisation was identified as a great public and private interest in the eIdentification survey of 2019 and thus became a further goal of the Swedish government.

The action plan contains 77 of the most important measures that were scheduled to begin implementation in 2019. The Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), together with the same seven government agencies, will release updated versions of the action plan annually up to 2022. The updated versions contain new measures to be initiated as well as an evaluation of the measures introduced starting 2019.

From a Swedish perspective, the OOP means that an amount of data reported to an authority must, if possible, be reused before it is requested again. Managed by the DIGG, the OOP is also part of the Swedish Framework for Digital Collaboration (i.e. the Swedish version of the EIF), developed by several government agencies within a collaboration programme called eSam. Additionally, a Swedish government committee has been in charge of developing further proposals and recommendations for the application of the OOP in Sweden as to the companies’ interactions with the public sector. It mainly proposes how coordination with regard to the OOP can be organised, and how a good and consistent description of the data requirement can be maintained.</p><p>Two government initiatives were launched in May 2018, focussing on establishing the foundation for a more standardised and interoperable national approach to base registries and information exchange. Several key stakeholders were involved, including some of the larger government agencies and the DIGG, which had the responsibility to coordinate work. </p><p>The final reports for these initiatives were submitted in 2019. As envisioned in the reports, two new government initiatives were launched at the end of 2019 with the aim of establishing a basic data national framework in public administration and a common digital management infrastructure for information exchange, for which an <a href="https://www.digg.se/4905d9/globalassets/dokument/publicerat/publikationer/delredovisning_etablera_nationellt_ramverk_for_grunddata_20210129.pdf">interim report</a> was published in 2021. The two initiatives will be implemented in 2021.</p><p>Furthermore, a number of Swedish authorities, mainly the Swedish Companies Registration Office, the Tax Agency and the Stockholm University, participated in the European large-scale pilot projects Once-Only Principle (OOP) and Digital Europe For All (DE4A), both exploring the OOP prior to the introduction of the Single Digital Gateway Regulation.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>Guidance from Central Government Authorities</p><p>The National Agency for Public Procurement provides guidance on eProcurement, eCommerce, the usage of dynamic purchasing systems and sustainability analysis.

Modern information and communication technologies (ICT) can make it easier for individuals to be involved in their own health and social care, support contact between individuals and service providers, and provide more efficient support systems for staff at service providers.</p><p>In 2016, the government and <a href="https://skr.se/tjanster/englishpages.411.html">SALAR</a> agreed on a <a href="https://ehalsa2025.se/english/">vision for eHealth</a>. This vision aims to provide support to make use of the opportunities of digitisation in social services and healthcare. In particular, a common vision for eHealth up to 2025 was endorsed. The vision says that: <em>“In 2025, Sweden will be best in the world at using the opportunities offered by digitisation and eHealth to make it easier for people to achieve good and equal health and welfare, and to develop and strengthen their own resources for increased independence and participation in the life of society”.</em></p><p>In February 2020, a<a href="https://ehalsa2025.se/visionen/"> strategy for eHealth for the period of 2020–2022</a> complemented the vision. The purpose of the strategy is to determine how the joint work of the government and SALAR should be designed and prioritised. The priorities identified are: (i) people awareness and involvement; (ii) safe and secure information; (iii) knowledge; (iv) digital transformation; and (v) collaboration. The government and SALAR will also work together on the legal framework and the consistent use of terminology and standards.<a id="_Hlk68684053"></a></p><p class="subtitle">Digitisation of the Judiciary</p><p>Digitisation can contribute to a judicial system which is well-functioning, efficient, based on rule of law and trusted by the people. Authorities in the judicial system should accelerate the digital exchange of information and at the same time strengthen their digital government capability, based on the <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/forordning--20191283-om-rattsvasendets_sfs-2019-1283">Ordinance (2019:1283) on the Digitisation of the Judiciary</a>. In light of this, judicial authorities have been commissioned to jointly develop methods for managing criminal cases, focusing on efficiency, and to examine how to offer crime victims a better digital response.</p><p>In order to strengthen coordination, the government established a Council for the Digitisation of the Judiciary, consisting of representatives from the law enforcement agencies. The Council held its first meeting in September 2020.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk66918097"></a>Covid-19 and the Effects on Digitisation – A National Study</p><p>Since mid-March 2020, the corona pandemic has changed the way people live and businesses operate in Sweden. The limitation of physical meetings has led to a rapid and comprehensive digital transformation. In June 2020, the government commissioned the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority and the DIGG to make use of the experiences of this digital transition in order to provide support to the government's work to contribute to better conditions for living and working digitally. The <a href="https://www.digg.se/om-oss/regeringsuppdrag/avslutade-regeringsuppdrag/kartlagga-och-analysera-erfarenheter-och-behov-av-atgarder-for-att-leva-och-verka-digitalt-i-sparen-av-covid-19">assignment</a> was extensive and the digital transition was examined in four sectors (culture, education, care and e-commerce) and from four perspectives (digital participation and accessibility, teleworking, electronic communication and leadership). The <a href="https://pts.se/sv/dokument/rapporter/internet/2021/digital-omstallning-till-foljd-av-covid-19-pts-er-20211/">final report</a> showed that the pandemic has accelerated the digital transition in the Swedish society, but there is still work to be done.</p><p class="subtitle">Covid-19 and the Effects on the Development of eHealth</p><p>The pandemic has had great impact on the development of eHealth and the digital transformation of health and social care. In Sweden, conditions for a rapid transition towards more digital activities were relatively good. In many organisations, the technical tools were already in place (e.g. for video meetings), but the pandemic has led to increased use. Other already existing tools, such as national quality registers, have been used in new ways to monitor and plan care. Information channels such as <a href="https://www.1177.se/">1177.se</a> and <a href="https://www.krisinformation.se/">krisinformation.se</a> saw a big boost at the start of the pandemic, as well as eServices with personal login. These services have also evolved in a short time, with new features for booking a test and presenting test results to citizens. </p><p>The strategies and visions previously developed highlighted the importance of digital transformation in order to achieve good and equal healthcare. The developments in the field of eHealth that have been going on in Sweden for many years, e.g. related to the Vision eHealth 2025 (see also 3.4), are likely to have played a major role in the rapid transition to more digital care.</p><p>The pandemic can be expected to have an impact also in the future: standards have obviously changed, as a large proportion of the population has become more accustomed to using digital tools in their everyday work. This is likely to facilitate the increased use of digital tools in the future, also in healthcare. At the same time, the digital divide remains and perhaps the gap between those who have the necessary abilities and access to new technology and those who lack them can widen. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk66912314"></a>European Blockchain Partnership</p><p>Regarding blockchain, Sweden has committed to the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-blockchain-strategy-brochure">European Blockchain Partnership</a> by sending experts to all the groups.

A supplier which does not send invoices that meet the requirements of the law may be fined. The DIGG recommends the use of Peppol BIS Billing 3, which is an implementation (CIUS) of the European Standard.

The National Medication List creates a single source for data on a patient’s prescribed medicines and other products while safeguarding the patient’s right to privacy. The data may, for example, be used by pharmacies and healthcare providers, under certain circumstances.</p><p>As mentioned, the legislation on the National Medication List gained legal force on 1 May 2021 with a transition period of two years. During the transition period, healthcare providers must adapt their systems to the new legislation. Existing information technology (IT) services and systems will be phased out after the transition period but will continue being in production, in parallel with the new IT services that have been developed for the new list.</p><p>Registering data in the National Medication List will be mandatory for pharmacies and prescribers of medicines. Patients can block access to certain information but not opt‑out from the registration.

Laws are passed by the <em>Riksdag</em>, a Parliament elected every four years. The Prime Minister is appointed by the <em>Riksdag</em> and tasked with forming a government. The government, led by the Prime Minister, governs Sweden. The government consists of the Prime Minister and a number of Ministers, each with their own area of responsibility. Each Ministry is responsible for a number of government agencies tasked with applying the laws and carrying out the activities decided on by the <em>Riksdag</em> and the government. </p><p>Every year the government issues appropriation directions for the government agencies. These set out the objectives of the agencies’ activities and how much funding they have at their disposal. The government therefore has quite substantial scope for directing the activities of government agencies, but it has no powers to interfere on how an agency applies the law or decides in a specific case. The government agencies make these decisions independently and report to the Ministries. In many other countries, a Minister has the power to intervene directly in an agency’s day-to-day operations. This possibility does not exist in Sweden, as ‘ministerial rule’ is prohibited.</p><p class="subtitle">The Swedish administrative model – three levels</p><p>Sweden is governed at three levels: national, regional and local. </p><p><strong>National level</strong></p><p>The <em>Riksdag</em>, which has the power to pass legislation, represents the people at national level. The government governs Sweden by executing decisions taken by the <em>Riksdag</em> and putting forward new laws and legislative amendments. The government is supported in this by the government offices and the government agencies.</p><p><strong>Regional level</strong></p><p>Sweden is divided into 21 counties. Each county has a regional central government authority, the county administrative board. Some other government agencies also operate at regional and local level. There are 21 county councils, which are led by political assemblies elected by the people. The main task of county councils is healthcare. Counties and county councils cover the same geographical area (with one exception) so they are usually regarded jointly as the regional level. The highest decision-making bodies are the county council assemblies or regional councils. The county councils’ activities are governed by the Local Government Act, but there is scope for autonomy, i.e. decisions in each municipality, county council or region are made in specific sectors.</p><p><strong>Local level</strong></p><p>Sweden has 290 municipalities which are responsible for the majority of public services in the area where citizens live. Their most important responsibilities include preschools, schools, social services and elderly care. The municipalities are governed by politicians elected by the people. The highest decision-making bodies are the municipal councils/city councils. The municipalities’ activities are governed by the Local Government Act but, similarly to the regional level, there is some scope for autonomy.</p><h2><a id="_Hlk66983179"></a>National </h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474974"></a>Policy</h3><p class="subtitle">Ministry of Infrastructure</p><p>In January 2019, the <a href="https://www.government.se/government-of-sweden/ministry-of-infrastructure/">Ministry of Infrastructure</a> was established.

The SGSI is an IP service, a virtual private network which has no direct connection with the open internet. </p><p>According to the security target in force, the SGSI is used by accredited government agencies. Accreditation implies that case sensitive information which has been classified according to the EU Council’s security regulations as ‘Restreint UE’ can be transferred to TESTA and to connected agencies. The SGSI has a wider function than that of TESTA-traffic channel as, for example, it allows for communication between police and judicial agencies.

The new ‘national identity card’ (<em>nationellt identitetskort</em>) is not compulsory and does not replace previous paper ID cards. It can be used as proof of identity and citizenship and as a valid travel document within the Schengen area. It complies with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards for biometric travel documents; it is issued by passport offices and manufactured by the same supplier as the biometric passport. In addition to the contactless chip containing a digital picture of the holder, it also has a traditional chip, which may be used to securely access eGovernment services in the future. </p><p>Changes are expected to the identity card due to Regulation (EU) 2019/1157 of the European Parliament and of the Council on strengthening the security of identity cards of Union citizens and of residence documents issued to Union citizens and their family members exercising their right of free movement. The changes, e.g. the inclusion of fingerprint information, are expected to be introduced in August 2021.</p><p>Despite the fact that it can be read electronically, the card is not an eID that can be used in order to authenticate the user remotely. A study proposed to complement it with an eID according to eIDAS Level of Assurance High, but no decision has been made yet.</p><p class="subtitle">Non-Official eID Cards and Software-based eIDs (eLegitimation)</p><p>The supply of eIDs in Sweden goes through an open system whereby all suppliers issuing eIDs for private persons and fulfilling certain requirements are allowed to sign a contract with the public sector. Before the suppliers can be approved, the DIGG performs an audit. Therefore, Swedish citizens are using non-official electronic ID cards or mobile/computer-based eIDs issued by different providers, like the BankID (developed by the largest Swedish banks), Telia and Freja eID+, to access certain eGovernment services. Any physical person with a Swedish personal identity number (a unique identification number for all registered residents in Sweden) and permanently living in Sweden can obtain an eID. Physical persons can also get an eID from the organisation they work for. The personal identity number is used as the identifier when the eID is used for an eService, while legal entities can have an organisational number as identifier. The same number can be used in certificates for authentication and signing. The certificates contain the name of the organisation and the organisational number, and may also include a URL. The contact person ordering organisational certificates must have an authorisation for this purpose from a person authorised to sign on behalf of his/her organisation. </p><p>Most actors in the public sector base their eServices on the SAML 2.0 standard, even though old eID schemes do not follow the standard. For this reason, most eServices rely on proxy IdPs. This system has worked well but deviations from the standard in the implementation of proxy IdPs have become an obstacle for implementing cross-border authentications and for new suppliers that fulfil the standard.</p><p class="subtitle">eIDAS</p><p>Sweden has implemented the eIDAS infrastructure and has established communication with all notified countries who are also technically prepared to deliver identity assertions according to their notification (11 at the moment). Moreover, about 190 agencies and municipalities have now integrated cross-border authentication among their eServices or have initiated the integration process. Most of the services, however, require that the eID assertion contain a Swedish identification number, which prevents users to take full advantage of the service.</p><p class="subtitle">Biometric Passports</p><p>In October 2005, Sweden became the second European country to start issuing biometric passports compliant with the standards recommended by the <a href="https://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">ICAO</a>.</p><p>The ePassport has a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) microchip embedded in its polycarbonate data page containing a digital photo and personal information in the form of a fingerprint photo.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">eProcurement Virtual System</p><p>According to the report ‘<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/sites/digital-agenda/files/egov_report.pdf">Digitising Public Services in Europe: Putting Ambition into Action - 9<sup>th</sup> Benchmark Measurement</a>’, produced for the European Commission in December 2010, Sweden set an eProcurement virtual system with a non-mandatory platform where eProcurement services are provided by subcontractors specialised in the different steps of the electronic procurement process. The central eProcurement authorities’ role consists in monitoring the supplied services and complying with standards. In general, the Swedish government has not implemented a central electronic public procurement portal, as this is deliberately left up to private operators. Several privately owned and operated portals exist instead, some of which concentrate on public procurement.</p><p class="subtitle">Information on Coordinated Public Sector Framework Agreements</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kammarkollegiet.se/om-oss/organisation/statens-inkopscentral">National Procurement Services</a> offer a website, <a href="https://www.avropa.se/">avropa.se</a>, that serves as an information database on the different framework agreements which were procured centrally by the National Procurement Services. The portal is available to national authorities, government agencies, regions and municipalities. An agency can thus use the information portal to locate the necessary information on a framework agreement, whereas the procurement process is further handled by the agency itself, either by electronic or traditional means.</p><p>Differently, general information on public procurement in Sweden is to be found at the website of the National Agency for Public Procurement. Furthermore, the National Agency for Public Procurement is involved in eTendering (pre-award) in Peppol, while the DIGG is active in the post-award phase. This means that Sweden has increased its effort to digitise the whole eProcurement process.</p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing Infrastructure and Standard</p><p>The European eInvoicing standard, EN 16931, is mandatory according to the <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/lag-20181277-om-elektroniska-fakturor-till_sfs-2018-1277">Law on Electronic Invoices as a Result of Public Procurement</a> (2018), but the law permits agreements on the use of other formats. The DIGG recommends the use of Peppol BIS Billing 3, which is an implementation (CIUS) of EN 16931. According to the <a href="https://www.riksdagen.se/sv/dokument-lagar/dokument/svensk-forfattningssamling/forordning-2003770-om-statliga-myndigheters_sfs-2003-770">Ordinance for Electronic Information Exchange</a> (2003), central government authorities must support Peppol BIS Billing 3, but can also support a few older invoice formats in existing agreements. </p><p>The DIGG also recommends the use of the Peppol infrastructure for sending and receiving invoices as well as other eProcurement messages. The DIGG is the Peppol authority of Sweden, leading the work on the national Peppol infrastructure and offering support primarily to service providers within Peppol but also to end users, like suppliers from the private sector and buyers in the public sector.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">eKrona Project</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/"><em>Riksbank</em></a>, Sweden’s Central bank, has the task of promoting a safe and efficient payment system, a task that may be more difficult in the future if cash is no longer used as a means of payment by the majority of households and companies. The <em>Riksbank</em> therefore needs to consider which role it should adopt in an increasingly digital world. In this context, Sweden started a project in the spring of 2017 to examine the possibility of issuing a new Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), the so-called <a href="https://www.riksbank.se/sv/betalningar--kontanter/e-krona/"><em>e-krona</em></a><em>.</em> An <em>e‑krona</em> would give the general public access to a digital complement to cash, whose value would be guaranteed by the government. At present, the <em>Riksbank</em> only offers digital money to banks and other RIX participants. </p><p>In order to increase the knowledge of the CBDC, since February 2020 the <em>Riksbank</em> has been running a proof of concept (POC), the <em>e-krona</em> pilot, with a technical supplier (Accenture) to develop and test a platform based on distributed ledger and blockchain technology for an <em>e-krona</em> system in a limited test environment. The objective of the <em>e‑krona</em> pilot is to learn more about the certain technology in particular and to investigate issues (technical, policy and legal) regarding an <em>e-krona</em> in general. The <em>Riksbank</em> ended the first phase of the POC in the beginning of 2021 and has extended the agreement for one year to continue the development and evaluation of the platform.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle">Platform for Municipal Cooperation and Development</p><p>Local authorities have their own <a href="https://sambruk.se/">Platform for Cooperative Use</a>, the purpose of which is to cooperate around business development and digital services, and to exchange best practices, that way speeding up the development of eGovernment in the municipalities.
