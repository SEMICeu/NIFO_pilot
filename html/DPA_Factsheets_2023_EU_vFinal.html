This was further stressed by the European Commission through its Staff Working Document <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/supporting_public_administrations_in_eu_ms_to_deliver_reforms_0.pdf">‘Supporting Public Administrations to deliver reforms and prepare</a> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/supporting_public_administrations_in_eu_ms_to_deliver_reforms_0.pdf">for the future’</a>. Following a period where the reliance on digital public services increased, continuing to implement strategies and funding programmes that foster the coordinated modernisation of public administrations in the Member States prevails as an important course of action. This can also be seen through the Member States’ National Recovery and Resilience Plans, where the digitalisation and modernisation of the public sphere play an important role.</p><p>The EU remains focused on adapting and overcoming the challenges of globalisation, by narrowing the gap between the leading and lower-performing Member States, as well as increasing the connectivity and security of services across borders for the benefit of consumers, business and society.</p><p>This factsheet presents an overview of the European landscape in terms of digitalisation of public administrations and interoperability, outlines the main EU actors responsible for this transition and offers an overview of the primary political initiatives, legislative instruments and funding programmes supporting the digitalisation of the European public administration and interoperability in the European Union.</p><p>The EU’s main actors and institutions responsible for the coordination and implementation of digital public administration services and the implementation of legislative initiatives for the modernisation of the public sector are overseen by the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/vestager_en">Executive Vice-President-designate</a> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/commissioners/2019-2024/vestager_en">for a Europe fit for the Digital Ages,</a> Ms. Vestager.

The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-21.x-emf" alt="32-21.x-emf" /> </p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechan<a id="_Hlt137832824"></a><a id="_Hlt137832825"></a>ism <a id="_Hlt137832559"></a><a id="_Hlt137832560"></a>2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise within the 27 Member States (EU average) in 2022.</p><p><img src="img/32-25.x-emf" alt="32-25.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF principles for the 27 Member States with multiple principles scoring at 4. Areas of improvement are concentrated in the Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility), 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency), for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of the corresponding recommendations. However, it should be noted that Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) outperform 2021 and therefore score slightly above 3 in 2022.</p><p>The result of 3,5 for Principle 1 (<strong>subsidiarity and proportionality</strong>), at European level, shows a partial implementation of EIF recommendations in existing or ongoing NIFs and policies. However, the analysis of the results revealed that the number of countries reporting a high level of alignment of their NIFs and strategies with the EIF increased from 13 in 2021 to 15 in 2022. When analysing the overall European countries’ performance on Principle 7 on <strong>inclusion and accessibility</strong>, the results revealed a partial implementation of the accessibility standards set forth by the Directive (EU) 2016/2102 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public- sector bodies (Recommendation 14). The results of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism with regard to <strong>multilingualism</strong> showed a heterogeneous implementation of the principle. For instance, the possibility of accessing instructions for completing the procedures in an official EU language is not always ensured in the European countries, especially for procedures related to moving. With an average score of 3, the results for Principle 12 on <strong>effectiveness and efficiency</strong> showed that return on investment and adaptability are the least considered when assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of public services, while simplification of administrative processes and reusability are more commonly taken into account across Europe (Recommendation 19).</p><p><img src="img/32-28.x-emf" alt="32-28.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>For the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2, the 27 Member States show on average a very good performance in implementing almost all layers with the score of 4. The European Union's implementation of the Scoreboard 2 recommendations in the areas of interoperability governance has decreased and is now between 3 and 4 in 2022 instead of 4.</p><p>With respect to the <strong>interoperability governance</strong> layer (Recommendations 20 to 24), there have been significant improvements mainly regarding the implementation of a holistic governance across all administrative levels and sectors, and the implementation of defined processes for the selection and adoption of standards and specifications. More specifically, almost all European countries now provide interoperability governance with a holistic approach across all administrative levels and sectors, with the exception of three countries that are still in the process of doing so.</p><p><img src="img/32-30.x-emf" alt="32-30.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The average scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 of the 27 Member States show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model, internal and external information sources and services, base registries and open data. However, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to catalogues, external information sources and services as well as in the area of security and privacy although their performance was better in 2022 than in 2021.</p><p>The results on <strong>Catalogues</strong>, at European level, for this particular indicator outlined a partial implementation of these key catalogues within public administrations (Recommendation 44). Indeed, while open data portals and catalogues of public data are used in a vast majority of European countries, it appears that other types of catalogues, such as libraries of software components and catalogues of specifications and guidelines are yet to be implemented uniformly across Europe. The 2022 results of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism revealed that European countries insufficiently rely on <strong>external sources and services</strong> for the development of their public services (Recommendation 45). On the one hand, it appears that the use of Internet of Things sources (e.g. sensors) and social web applications is quite low across Europe. On the other hand, the use of payment services provided by financial institutions or other actors, connectivity services provided by telecommunications providers, open data, data from other organisations (e.g. international organisations, chambers of commerce, etc...), eID and eSignature are much more widespread among European public administrations.</p><p>The score for <strong>security and privacy</strong> at the European level, showed an overall good implementation of Recommendation 46 within national frameworks, with an increase in the implementation of all privacy and security elements and measures, but with the exception of risk management. However, the scores for Recommendation 47 are heterogeneous, as the number of trust service providers present on national trusted lists complying with the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">eIDAS Regulation</a> varies across countries and remains insufficient in some of them.</p><p><img src="img/32-33.x-emf" alt="32-33.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of the 27 Member States concerning Cross-border Interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show a good performance in 16 indicators. However, there is still margin for improvement. For instance, the Member States could focus on Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility), Principle 9 (Multilingualism), Principe 10 (Administrative simplification) as well as Interoperability governance and Security and Privacy which all have a score of 3. The key priorities should be on the simplification of processes and the use of digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users’ requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses and citizens (<strong>Administrative simplification</strong> - Recommendation 17) but also on the use of a structured, transparent, objective and common approach to assessing and selecting standards and specifications (<strong>Interoperability governance</strong> - Recommendation 22). Lastly, a particular effort should be made on the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (<strong>Security and Privacy</strong> - Recommendation 47).</p><p>An in-depth analysis of the European results in the 2022 edition of the EIF Monitoring Mechanism will be available within the Annex 2 of the State of Play report on digital public administration and interoperability in Europe.
