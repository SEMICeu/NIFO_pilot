The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-813.png" alt="32-813.png" /></p><p> Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022 </a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Latvia in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-820.x-emf" alt="32-820.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Latvian scores on Scoreboard 1 showcase an overall very good implementation of the 12 EIF Principles. Indeed, the country received the highest score of 4 on 10 out of 12 of the Principles, and scores above the EU average on the same 10 Principles. Nonetheless, potential areas of improvement for Latvia are related to Principle 3 (Transparency) and Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility), for which the score of 3 could be further improved. More particularly, the country should continue to ensure internal visibility and provide external interfaces for European public services (Principle 3 – Recommendation 5) as well as continue to ensure that all European public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14). </p><p>   </p><p><img src="img/32-823.x-emf" alt="32-823.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Latvia’s scores on Scoreboard 2 illustrate an overall very good performance on all interoperability layers as the country received the highest score of 4 on all layers, except for Interoperability governance. More precisely, potential areas of improvement for Latvia are related to the use of structured, transparent, objective and common approaches to assess and select standards and specifications (Interoperability governance – Recommendation 22) as well as to further consult relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and at EU level, in accordance with the country’s NIF, when procuring and developing ICT solutions (Interoperability governance – Recommendation 23).  </p><p><img src="img/32-826.x-emf" alt="32-826.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The Latvian results on the Conceptual Model (Scoreboard 3) show an upper-medium performance of the country. Although the country received the highest score on four areas of the Conceptual model, namely the model itself, Internal information sources and services, Base registries and Open Data, potential areas of improvement still persist. Most notably, with regard to the area od Security and Privacy, where the country received an overall score of 2. Latvia should further use trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (Security and Privacy – Recommendation 47). </p><p><img src="img/32-829.x-emf" alt="32-829.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Latvia on Scoreboard 4 on the Cross-Border Interoperability aspect show an overall good implementation by the country. Particularly, Latvia received the highest score on seven EIF Principles, four Interoperability layers and three areas of the Conceptual model. However, there are still some potential areas of improvement, most particularly with regard to the Security and Privacy aspect, where the country received a score of 2. Indeed, Latvia should continue to consider the specific security and privacy requirements and identify measures for the provision of each public service according to risk management plans (Recommendation 46) as well as to further use trust services according to the Regulation on eID, as mentioned before (Recommendation 47).</p><p>Additional information on Latvia’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><img src="img/32-832.png" alt="32-832.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><p><a id="_Toc1035577"></a><a id="_Toc1474948"></a> </p><h1><a id="_Toc140674617"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Latvian government signed the <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/EN/eu-presidency/gemeinsame-erklaerungen/berlin-declaration-digital-society.pdf;jsessionid=3C079021929382844AA0F4B7D8EE3023.1_cid287?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=6">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other EU Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies.

Information is available in multiple languages.</p><p class="subtitle">National Open Data Portal </p><p>The <a href="https://www.varam.gov.lv/en">Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development</a> (MEPRD) launched the Latvian <a href="https://data.gov.lv/lv">Open Data Portal</a> in 2017. This platform provides a single point of access to open government data. The portal currently features 615 datasets from 93 data publishers, but this is expected to grow over time, as more data publishers will gradually join the portal. Data publishers are responsible for the data published on the portal. The MEPRD offers methodological support to publishers by providing material that also forms part of the content available on the portal. The technical operation of the portal is carried out by the <a href="http://www.vraa.gov.lv/en/">State Regional Development Agency</a>.</p><p>In addition to providing Open Data, the portal offers other features such as a section on data skills, an overview of events as well as references to content developed by the European Data Portal, such as the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkKaDo-rIM4">Explore Open Data</a>. The Latvian Open Data Portal has been created using the open-source technology platform and open-source data catalogue of CKAN.</p><p>The new Latvian Open Data Portal is harvested by the <a href="https://www.europeandataportal.eu/">European Data Portal</a>, which means that all data published on the Latvian data portal are also available on the European Data Portal.</p><p class="subtitle">Platform to Develop Virtual Assistants for Public Administration Institutions</p><p>In 2018, the national public administration language technology platform <a href="http://www.hugo.lv">Hugo.lv</a> was launched using world-renowned AI-based machine translation systems, speech recognition tools and the National Term Database. The service provides automatic translation from Latvian into English and vice versa, as well as from Latvian into Russian to translate texts, documents, and websites enabling multilingualism in government eServices. The services provided through the platform are customised for the Latvian language and adapted specifically to public sector documents, providing much higher translation quality than generic online translation systems.</p><p>In 2019, the <a href="http://www.kis.gov.lv/">Centre for Culture Information Systems</a> has launched an <a href="https://hugo.lv/lv">innovative shared platform</a> to develop virtual assistants for public administration institutions based on the national public administration <a href="https://hugo.lv/lv">language technology platform</a>. This approach makes it possible to significantly save resources, since institutions only need to adjust the virtual assistants to their specific needs instead of developing their own virtual assistant from scratch. The expected outcome of the project is to equip public administration institutions with a modern tool to provide more user-friendly communication and customer-oriented public services in a more cost-efficient, effective, and time-saving manner.</p><p class="subtitle">Single Portal for Development and Harmonisation of Drafts Legal Acts</p><p>The <a href="https://www.mk.gov.lv/en/tap-portals">Single Portal for Development and Harmonisation of Draft legal Acts</a> aims to modernise the process of legislative drafting by creating a single space for the storage of all information regarding the lifecycle of a draft legal act. The existence of a single platform also allows for greater participation of the public as citizens can find detailed information of all legal drafts on the same website. The TAP portal was launched in 2018 and has been developed by upgrading the <em>e-portfolio</em> system previously used by the public administration. </p><h3>Subnational Platforms and Applications</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474990"></a>Electronic Declaration System</p><p>The <a href="https://eds.vid.gov.lv/login/">Electronic Declaration System (EDS)</a> is a safe and convenient way for private individuals and legal entities to submit all tax returns and information declarations, as well as requests addressed to the State Revenue Service (SRS). EDS provides various registration and authentication options, such as eID, SRS-issued usernames and passwords, and iBanking. EDS also provides authentication services for the <em>de minimis</em> aid accounting system and other system users. In addition to document submission, EDS provides online services such as access to various registries, a personalised document and payment timetable/reminder calendar, tax payments, reports, payroll tax booklets, and correspondence with the SRS. EDS allows citizens to access various taxpayer data, such as employment records and tax relief information. Additionally, a mobile app for submitting eligible expense documents and various types of reports is available to EDS users. The app is free, guarantees user privacy and saves time. EDS is available in English and Russian to taxpayers who do not understand Latvian and non-residents. As of 1 June 2014, all payroll tax booklets are available only electronically. Both employees and employers have access to payroll tax booklets and can make adjustments as needed. All paper-format payroll tax booklets issued before 1 June 2014 are no longer valid.</p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><p>Latvia uses the Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) network as the main cross border infrastructure to communicate digitally among EU agencies, institutions, and Member States.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">State Information System Integrator</p><p>The State Information System Integrator (in Latvian - <em>Valsts Informācijas sistēmu savietotājs</em>, VISS) is an integrated set of solutions developed for public institutions to exchange data between various information systems in a platform-independent standardised manner.

After the one-year transition period ended on 18<sup> </sup>December 2020, the Latvian electronic identification should now be accepted for access to digital services infrastructures in other EU Member States. One of the Latvian identification means is the mobile app <a href="https://www.ur.gov.lv/lv/specializeta-informacija/elektroniskais-paraksts/privatpersonam/eparaksts-mobile/" target="_blank">eParaksts Mobile</a>, which can be used to sign documents in the eSignature portal <a href="http://www.eparaksts.lv">www.eparaksts.lv</a>. </p><p><a id="_Hlk135125360"></a>All the electronic identification means from the public and private sectors, including the eIDAS gateway, are integrated in the unified authentication module, which is available for all public service providers. In the past years, as a consequence of the pandemic, the use of eIDAS electronic identification has gradually increased from 698 authentications in 2020 to 1 004 authentications in 2021 and 1291 in 2022. Currently, identification schemes with the level of assurance ‘high’ from twelve EU countries are integrated in the Latvian eIDAS gateway.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identity Card</p><p>The Electronic Identity Card (eID) can serve both as an identity and travel document within the EU and as a personal identification tool for eServices, in addition to providing a secure electronic signature.</p><p>The year 2021 marked the 15-year anniversary of the electronic signature in Latvia. In the past years the use of eSignatures has consistently increased every year, exceeding 14 million signatures in 2022. Currently, there are more than 900 000 eID card users in Latvia who are able to use their eSignature for easy and safe communication and service provision in the public sector. In Latvia, eSignatures are available free of charge for all citizens and are provided by the Latvia State Radio and Television Centre (LVRTC). In order to make this product more accessible and easier to use, LVRTC has also developed mobile solutions that allow the user to sign and verify documents by using their smart phones (eParaksts mobile and eParakstsLV).</p><p class="subtitle">eSignature Portal</p><p>The LVRTC <a href="https://www.eparaksts.lv/">online self-service website</a> solution was developed by the Latvia State Television and Radio Centre (hereinafter – LVRTC), which is the only certification authority and is fully responsible for this key public infrastructure. The portal does not require smart cards, special equipment or software to create documents with a trusted eSignature as it can be done by using the <a href="https://www.ur.gov.lv/lv/specializeta-informacija/elektroniskais-paraksts/privatpersonam/eparaksts-mobile/">eParaksts Mobile</a> app. The app can be used from any device with an internet connection. A document can be signed electronically in a few minutes and received by the beneficiary via e-mail. The portal offers both citizens and businesses extensive information and advice on eSignatures. A mobile eSignature was established in 2017 in Latvia.</p><p>At the end of 2019, the LVRTC was registered as a qualified provider of this solution. Consequently, the verification of eIdentity is possible with all eIdentity tools issued by the LVRTC: the mobile application eParaksts mobile (eSignature), the eID card, and the eParaksts (eSignature) card. Such identity verification methods are comparable to in‑person identity verification thanks to the personal identification document. </p><p class="subtitle">Machine-Readable Passports</p><p>Latvian passports comply with the requirements set out by the European Union in November 2007 and with international standards. Passports hold a microchip that contains information on the bearer and the document in a letter-number format, and individual biometric information such as the bearer’s photo and fingerprints. The information embedded in the microchip is protected by a security mechanism and a unique eSignature of the issuing institution that verifies the authenticity of the information. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Procurement System</p><p>Latvia follows a centralised approach to eProcurement.
