The Digital Roadmap Austria is an initiative of the Austrian Federal Government, coordinated by the Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs and was set up in 2017. The Digital Roadmap is seen as key to optimally exploiting the digital transition that is taking place in order to strengthen Austria as a business location and innovation leader and foster the participation of all people in the digital world. The Digital Roadmap Austria as comprehensive digital strategy for Austria includes numerous eGovernment activities in different areas, such as digital infrastructure, security, data protection and trust, digital politics and public administration, digital society, digital economy, digital research and innovation and digital future, as explained in the <a href="https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/documents/131008/569203/Regierungsprogramm_2017–2022.pdf/b2fe3f65-5a04-47b6-913d-2fe512ff4ce6">coalition agreement</a>.</p><p>The Digital Roadmap formulates a total of 12 guiding principles and incorporates around 150 specific measures in twelve areas of action, so benefits of the digitalisation process are identified and well-defined. With the Roadmap, the activities of all divisions are pooled in a joint strategy paper of the federal government for the first time. Because digitalisation is changing our world at great speed, the Digital Roadmap also remains “in motion”. It is a dynamic strategy paper that is continually adjusted to current developments relating to digitalisation and is thus a reliable common guideline in the direction of digital future.</p><p><a id="_Hlk6480820"></a>Strategic Action Plan on Digitalisation</p><p>Building on the results of the <a href="https://www.digitalroadmap.gv.at/">Digital Roadmap Austria</a>, a new and even more ambitious Digitisation Strategy for Austria is currently being developed under the auspices of the <a href="https://www.en.bmdw.gv.at/Ministry/Seiten/default.aspx">Ministry of Digital and Economic Affairs</a> with the aim of positioning Austria as digital leader in Europe.

This document is not a legally binding strategy; it rather sets out the mission statement and the basic strategic principles to be followed in the years to come in relation to eGovernment initiatives. The guidelines of Vision 2020 are relevant to the objectives of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/european-egovernment-action-plan-2011-2015">eGovernment Action Plan 2011-2015</a> for electronic public services launched by the European Commission on 15 December 2010. Establishing eID as a key enabler and advancing the inclusion with innovative public services, are among the priorities of the Austrian eGovernment strategy. The Vision 2020 particularly aims at development of the following areas:  comfort and simplicity, increase in efficiency, reliability and security, transparency and openness, participation, innovation, businesses, national and international convergence and synergy.</p><p>Federal eGovernment Strategy</p><p>The <a href="https://www.en.bmdw.gv.at/Digitalisation/Digitalisation_in_administration/PublishingImages/Seiten/default/E-Government-ABC_2019_EN.pdf">Federal eGovernment Strategy</a>, which is currently being revised, provides an efficient implementation of electronic government services, based on the basic premise that all businesses and citizens must be able to perform all the procedures of public administration quickly and easily, electronically and without having special technical expertise. To achieve this goal, the Austrian eGovernment strategies are based on the involvement and close cooperation between the federal state, cities and municipalities.</p><p>The Federal eGovernment Strategy is structured in a modular fashion:</p><ul><li><strong>eGovernment Strategy, Part I: online procedures</strong></li></ul><p>Part I deals with online procedures from the perspective of the user and provides framework, objectives and implementation directives of online processes. Online processes or online transactions are official channels and contacts with authorities, which can be conducted electronically from citizens. They should be open 7 days a week around the clock.</p><ul><li><strong>eGovernment Strategy, Part II: methods and procedures</strong></li></ul><p>Part II focuses on methods and procedures within the administration. Well-functioning automation-assisted methods require joint action by the authorities. Thus, standardised processes and systems that communicate with each other are necessary. Technical and <strong>organisational agreements</strong> must be respected and use common standards. For the realisation of electronic methods as such, it is therefore appropriate to analyse current business processes and where necessary, to restructure them.</p><ul><li><strong>Development of modules for online applications (MOA)</strong></li></ul><p>The modules for online applications are provided by the Federal government to serve as a tool by which eGovernment applications can be created efficiently and safely. The MOA are components that will facilitate the use of electronic signatures and other applications such as delivery to the public agencies. The modules have been prepared on behalf of the Federal Chancellery and the Federal Ministry of Finance. By June 2005, they were placed under the open source license for Apache Software Foundation in version 2.0. The distributions of the modules and the associated source code are thus freely available to all users.</p><ul><li><strong>Sample Applications </strong></li></ul><p>Several sample applications, like testing the Citizen Card, are open to public and private users. Some of these include: testing the citizen card, generate a toolkit for the generation of user certificates, provision of a citizen capsule (an emulation of a citizen card environment for test purposes and for the development of citizen card applications available) and a test mail message application. </p><p>The Federal eGovernment Strategy is based on a number of <a href="https://www.digitales.oesterreich.gv.at/das-e-government-abc">principles</a>, like its proximity to citizens, trust and security, transparency, accessibility, usability, data security, sustainability and interoperability.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3>Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Security aspects related to digital government</h3><p><em>Digitales Amt</em> Project</p><p>The Project <a href="https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/"><em>Digitales Amt</em></a> was launched with a Decision of the Austrian Council of Ministers of 15 January 2019 as a further important step to ensure that citizens' administrative procedures, as well as their contact with public authorities can be done completely electronically.</p><p>National Cyber Security Strategy </p><p>The Austrian <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/national-cyber-security-strategies/ncss-map/strategies/austrian-cyber-security-strategy">National Cyber Security Strategy</a> was implemented in 2013 and has been developed on the basis of the Security Strategy and is guided by the principles of the Austrian Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection. The Austrian Cyber Security Strategy (<em>Österreichische Strategie für Cyber Sicherheit,</em> ÖSCS) is a comprehensive and proactive concept for protecting cyber space and the people in virtual space while guaranteeing human rights. It aims to enhance the security and resilience of Austrian infrastructures and services in the cyber space.</p><p>Based on the 2013 strategy, an annual report on cyber security in Austria is prepared by the Cyber Security Steering Group. The current <a href="https://www.federal-chancellery.gv.at/cyber-security">Cyber Security Report</a> builds on the contents of the last year's report, supplementing it with current developments focusing on international and operational developments. The observation period is the year 2017, with individual current developments in the year 2018 that have been taken into account. The objective of the report is to provide a summary of the cyber threats and the national and international developments. Due to new challenges, Austria is currently updating the Cyber Security Strategy adopted in 2013.</p><h3>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date. </p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date. </p><h2>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Interoperability</h2><p>Austrian Interoperability Framework (AIF)</p><p>The establishment of the Austrian public services was an important initiative which represents a common goal among the different initiatives that the Federal Government has agreed to. The approval of the <a href="https://www.ref.gv.at/uploads/media/Austrian_Interoperability_Framework__AIF-1.0.0_.pdf">Austrian Interoperability Framework</a> (AIF) in January 2015 set a mutual goal to guide, promote and support the delivery of Austrian public services by fostering cross-border, cross-organisation and cross-sector interoperability. The framework addresses issues such as its underlying principles, the conceptual model for the public services, the interoperability levels, the interoperability agreements and the interoperability governance.</p><p>The purpose of the Austrian Interoperability Framework is: </p><ul><li>to promote and support the delivery of Austrian public services by fostering cross-border, cross-organisation and cross-sector interoperability; </li><li>to guide public administrations in their work to provide Austrian public services to businesses and citizens; </li><li>to complement and tie together the various Organisational Interoperability Frameworks (OIFs) at Austrian level. </li></ul><p>This non-technical document addresses all those involved in defining, designing and implementing Austrian public services. The AIF should be taken into account when making decisions on Austrian public services that support the implementation of Austrian policy initiatives. The AIF should also be considered when establishing public services that in the future may be reused as part of Austrian public services. It contributes to the better functioning of the internal market by increasing interoperability among Austrian public administrations.</p><p>An update of the Austrian Interoperability Framework is planned in the near future for adopting the key elements of the current version of the European Interoperability Framework.</p><p>Once-Only principle</p><p>The Once-Only principle has been a pivotal part of Austria’s <a href="https://www.bundeskanzleramt.gv.at/documents/131008/1194598/44_5_mrv_neues_material.pdf/cf1b7c69-bb2d-402d-9256-80cedc0616fb">digital government efforts</a> in recent years, with a strong focus given to the Once-Only principle within the current Austrian government program as well as, the Austrian Digitisation Strategy. The federal government has identified “once-only” and herewith the reduction of administrative burden for citizens as well as for companies as a key issue to be addressed. This includes several measures to alleviate the burden of information obligations on businesses and citizens, who should provide their data only once to the administration.</p><p>Thanks to the smart use of the available data in the back-office of the of a growing number of our public authorities, it becomes increasingly possible to provide no-stop procedures to the citizens, where visits to or contacts with authorities are eliminated entirely. As an example, Austria provides application-free family allowance, thanks to which citizens automatically receive the benefits that they are entitled to without having to complete or send in a form. Since the implementation in May 2015, families have automatically received family allowance on the birth of a child without having to file the application themselves. Overall, an estimated 80 000 families a year benefit from this “no-stop shop” solution.</p><p>At the same time the Austrian government puts strong emphasis to improve the framework conditions for <a href="https://www.en.bmdw.gv.at/Digitalisation/Digitalisation_for_companies/Seiten/default.aspx">companies</a>. This includes concrete measures to reduce the information obligations of companies and thus to alleviate the administrative burden. For example, Austria is carrying out a project which aims to ensure that, when a company car needs to be registered, the necessary data are provided only once.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p><a id="_Hlk6319472"></a>Artificial Intelligence Mission Austria 2030</p><p><a id="_Hlk6319472"></a>The Federal strategy <a href="https://www.bmvit.gv.at/service/publikationen/innovation/ikt/downloads/aimat_ua.pdf">Artificial Intelligence Mission Austria 2030</a> (AIM AT 2030) was launched with a Decision of the Austrian Council of Ministers of November 23, 2018 which is currently being revised.</p><p>Blockchain, Virtual reality, Augmented Reality, Smart Cities</p><p>Blockchain, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, smart cities are part of the comprehensive digitisation strategy currently being developed by the <a href="https://www.en.bmdw.gv.at/Seiten/default.aspx">Ministry of Digital and Economic Affairs</a> assisted by the <a href="https://www.ffg.at/dia">Digitalisation Agency</a>.</p><h1><a id="__RefHeading___Toc8650354"></a>Digital Government Legislation</h1><h2>Specific legislation on digital government</h2><p>eGovernment Act (2004)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=BgblAuth&amp;Dokumentnummer=BGBLA_2004_I_10">eGovernment Act</a>, the centrepiece in Austrian eGovernment law, entered into force on 1 March 2004 and was last amended on 27 December 2018. Austria was one of the first EU Member States to adopt a comprehensive legislation on eGovernment. This Act is the core of Austrian laws on eGovernment. This law serves as the legal basis for eGovernment instruments and components. Many mechanisms such as the citizen card, sector-specific personal identifiers and electronic delivery are also able to be put to use in the private sector.</p><p>The most important principles of eGovernment law are:</p><ul><li>Freedom of choice for users in selecting the means of communication when contacting public authorities.</li><li>Security and improved legal protection provided by appropriate technical measures such as the citizen card.</li><li>Unhindered access for people with special needs to public administration information and services.</li></ul><p>The <a id="_Hlk6319557"></a>amendments to the Act made on 17 May 2018 and 27 December 2018 regarded the GDPR and new responsibilities. They were made primarily to adapt the national legislation to the new terminology used in the GDPR. Furthermore, the responsibility for the Source-PIN Register Authority changed from the <a href="https://www.dsb.gv.at/">Austrian Data Protection Authority</a> to the <a href="https://www.en.bmdw.gv.at/Ministry/Seiten/default.aspx">Federal Minister for Digital and Economic Affairs.</a></p><p>General Administrative Procedures Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Erv&amp;Dokumentnummer=ERV_1991_51">General Administrative Procedures Act</a> lays down the basic principles of administrative procedures. Article 13 is relevant to eGovernment in that it regulates the ways with which public authorities and citizens can communicate with each other, such as the transmission of applications by email or Web forms. The authority’s website lists the addresses that application forms can be sent to, whether an electronic signature is needed, and which formats are recommended or required for the application.</p><p>Since 1 January 2011, documents issued by public authorities require a handwritten signature, certification or 'official signature'. All electronic documents of written copies from public authorities are required to have an 'official signature' affixed to them. The 'official signature' is an advanced electronic signature including specific elements to certify that the 'official' origin of the document.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3>Access to public information</h3><p>Constitutional Law on Access to Information (1987)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1987_286/ERV_1987_286.pdf">Constitutional Law on Access to Information</a> (Auskunftspflichtgesetz) became effective on 1 January 1988. This law contains provisions on access to public information in the federal and regional levels. It stipulates a general right of access and obliges federal authorities to answer questions regarding their areas of responsibility, insofar as this does not conflict with a legal obligation to maintain secrecy. However, it does not permit citizens to access documents, only to receive answers from the government on the content of information. The 9 Austrian Länder have enacted laws that place similar obligations on their authorities.</p><p>Re-use of Information Act (2005)</p><p>The Directive 2003/98/EC on reusing public sector information has been transposed into national law at federal level through the Re-use of Information Act (<a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/eli/bgbl/I/2015/76"><em>Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz</em></a>; IWG), in November 2005. To achieve the complete transposition of the PSI Directive, pertinent legislation was passed in all 9 Austrian <em>Länder</em>. On 7 September 2007, Austria notified the last pending implementation (State Law of Salzburg), thereby completing transposition of the PSI Directive.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p><a href="https://www.digital.austria.gv.at/sourcepin-register-authority-regulation">SourcePIN Register Regulation</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20006487"><a id="_Hlk6319969"></a>SourcePIN Register Regulation</a> specifies the tasks of the SourcePIN Register Authority which are necessary for the implementation of the citizen card concept and the cooperation with its service providers. The main provisions deal with the following: </p><ul><li>The process for creating identity links, in particular the duties of registration offices, the validation of identity, and the identity link dataset. </li><li>The transformation of sector-specific personal identifiers (ssPIN) into ssPINs from other sectors, generating ssPINs for certain mandate relationships and the configuration of data applications from the controller from the public sector.</li><li>The electronic presentation and verification of mandate relationships as pertains to the citizen card concept. One of the remarkable achievements of the citizen card concept is the possibility to represent mandate relationships electronically. The SourcePIN Register Authority signs or seals the mandate dataset and thus prevents forgery of such datasets stored on citizen cards. The SourcePIN Register Authority enables users to view and revoke mandates online.</li></ul><p>eGovernment Sectors Delimitation Regulation</p><p>For the purpose of generating sector-specific personal identifiers, each public sector data application needs to be assigned to a sector of State activity. The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20003476"><a id="_Hlk6320010"></a>eGovernment Sector Delimitation Regulation</a> defines the designations and the sector-identifiers.</p><p><a href="https://www.digital.austria.gv.at/supplementary-register-regulation"><a id="_Hlk6320041"></a>Supplementary Register Regulation</a></p><p><a id="_Hlk6320041"></a>This <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20006490">Regulation</a> plays an important role in the implementation of the citizen card concept, enabling natural persons and other affected parties to be registered in the supplementary register, who, due to legal restrictions, are not permitted to be entered into the primary registers.</p><p>The supplementary register is comprised of two registers: for natural persons and for other concerned parties. The eGovernment Act allows the SourcePIN Register Authority to take over the duties of service provider for the Ministry of Interior for the supplementary register for natural persons and for the Ministry of Finance for the second supplementary register.</p><p>Signature and Trust Services Act (SVG)</p><p>Through the creation of a new and EU-wide harmonised legal framework for trust services, the <a href="https://www.signatur.rtr.at/en/vd/SVG.html">Signature and Trust Services Act</a> was to be rescinded and a new accompanying or implementing law issued to the eIDAS regulation for the topic of trust services.</p><p>The SVG regulates those areas in which the directly applicable eIDAS Regulation gives the Member States the possibility of issuing national regulations. This concerns in particular regulations or specifications in the areas of trust service providers, supervision, formal regulations, liability and penalties in the event of non-compliance with the specifications of the eIDAS Regulation. Although the SVG applies to all trust services, the creation, validation and preservation of electronic signatures continue to be the core. For instance, the legal effects valid up until now pursuant to the SigG of the written form pursuant to Section 886 ABGB of a qualified electronic signature with regard to general formal regulations of Austrian civil law are retained. It therefore continues to be possible to sign contracts electronically with an electronic signature with the same effect as if you were to sign the contract by hand. In addition, an important step for consumer protection was made with the SVG: companies can no longer exclude in “hidden clauses” in the general terms and conditions of business that they accept the electronic signature and thus e.g. prevent electronic terminations of subscriptions.</p><p>The last amendments to the Act made on 17 May 2018 and 27 December 2018 regarded the GDPR.</p><h3>Security aspects related to digital government</h3><p>Security of Network and Information Systems Act (2018)</p><p><a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20010536"><a id="_Hlk6320079"></a>Security of Network and Information Systems Act</a> was adopted on 28 December 2018 as the transposition of the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?toc=OJ:L:2016:194:TOC&amp;uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2016.194.01.0001.01.ENG">NIS Directive</a>.</p><p>Data Protection Act (2000)</p><p>The Austrian <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_1999_1_165/ERV_1999_1_165.pdf">Data Protection Act</a> (<em>Datenschutzgesetz</em> 2000; DSG 2000, Federal Law Gazette I No. 165/1999) came into effect on 1 January 2000. In implementation of the Directive on Data Protection <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:en:HTML">95/46/EC</a>, the act provides for a fundamental right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data which entails the right to information, rectification of incorrect data and removal of unlawfully processed data. It regulates the pre-conditions for the lawful use and transfer of data, including mandatory notification and registration obligations with the Data Protection Commission. Furthermore, it provides for judicial remedy in case of breach of its provisions. </p><p>The Data Protection Act was amended in 2017 in particular as a result of the adjustment to the EU Regulation no. 2016/679 for the protection of natural persons in the processing of personal data, for free data traffic and rescission of the directive <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&amp;from=EN">95/46/EC</a> (General data protection Regulation - GDPR). These amendments entered into force on 25 May 2018.</p><h3>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>Central Commercial Registry</p><p>For the Central Commercial Registry (ZGW), the legal bases are the <a href="https://www.jusline.at/gesetz/ugb">Commercial Code</a> (<em>Unternehmensgesetzbuch</em> - UGB) and the <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10002997">Commercial Registry Act</a> (<em>Firmenbuchgesetz</em> - FBG). The latter does not exactly provide a clear definition, but article 1 states that the Commercial Registry consists of the general ledger and a collection of documents. The Registry is used to record and disclose facts which are to be entered under this Act or other legal regulations. It includes information such as which entities are intended to be registered in the general ledger, the collection of documents, the notification requirements, the database of the commercial registry, judicial administration measures, etc.</p><p>Central Civil Registry</p><p>The main legislation for the Central Civil Registry (ZPR)<strong> </strong>is the <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20008228">Civil Status Act</a> of 2013, section 2, article 43-45, which places the Central Civil Registry as a public registry. It states that the Civil Status Authorities may only use personal data when this is necessary to fulfil the tasks assigned to them. The Civil Status Authorities may order to fulfil the tasks entrusted to them in a local Civil Registry. The Act also provides information regarding the use of the data from the registry, queries, certificates, the structure of the Registry and the keeping and exhibition of the documents.</p><p>Land Registry</p><p>The Land Registry´s main piece of legislation is the <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10001941">General Land Registry Law</a> (GBG), but the law does not provide a clear definition. The Land Registry is public and can, therefore, be accessed and extracted copies from by anyone in the presence of an official. The Law also states the types of registration, information regarding certificates, the effect of registration, rectification of data, etc.</p><p>Central Registry of Vehicles</p><p>In the case of the Central Registry of Vehicles (KZR), the main law is the <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10011384">Motor Vehicles Act</a> (KFG, 1967), which is a very extensive law covering everything related to motor vehicles.</p><p>Central Resident’s Registry</p><p>For the Central Residents’ Registry<strong> </strong>(ZMR), the most relevant pieces of legislations are articles 16, 16a and 18 from the <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10005799">Notification Act</a> (MeldeG) and articles 15 and 17 from the <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20001806">Registration Act Implementation</a> (MeldeV). The Notification Act places the Central Registry as a public registry, says it is conducted as a joined information system and states the details regarding the permissibility of using the data from the Central Registry. The second act specifies the administrative charges.</p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p>Federal Procurement Act (2018)</p><p>The new <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20010295">Federal Procurement Act</a> was adopted on 20 August 2018 (<em>Bundesvergabegesetz</em>, BVergG 2018) and substitutes the <a href="http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/unpan/unpan034219.pdf">Federal Procurement Act</a>, which entered into force on 1 February 2006, replacing the Federal Procurement Act 2002 and repealing the eProcurement Regulation 2004. The new Federal Procurement Act 2018 finally transposed all the EU public procurement directives, including their provisions regarding eProcurement, into national law. </p><p>eInvoicing</p><p>The provision of Section 5 of the <a href="https://www.erechnung.gv.at/files/IKTKonG.pdf">Austrian ICT Consolidation Act</a> from 2012 mandates that all contracting partners of the federal government, including foreign contracting partners, must only submit <a href="https://www.erechnung.gv.at/erb/?p=info_jur&amp;locale=en_GB">structured electronic invoices</a> for the provision of goods and services to government departments. eInvoicing is mandatory only for the federal government although a few <a href="https://www.erechnung.gv.at/erb/?p=einvoice_info_fedgov_paper&amp;locale=en_GB">exceptions</a> do not require eInvoicing. </p><p>Austria mandates the use of the <a href="https://www.usp.gv.at/Portal.Node/usp/public">Federal Service Portal</a> (USP), the central processing eInvoicing platform of the federal government to receive eInvoices. The Portal provides authentication services necessary for the submission of eInvoices and does not require further use of electronic signature.</p><h2><strong>Domain-specific legislation</strong></h2><p>Service of Documents Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Erv&amp;Dokumentnummer=ERV_1982_200">Service of Documents Act</a>, last amended on 27 December 2018, governs the delivery of all documents, such as official notices, which government authorities are required by law to send out. In both electronic and paper-based circumstances, a differentiation is made between deliveries that require proof of delivery, by which the recipient confirms the delivery with a signature, and deliveries where no proof is required.</p><p>Proof of delivery is carried out through an electronic delivery service. This service is available from delivery service providers that have been approved by the Federal Chancellor. It allows customers (citizens and businesses) to register with their citizen card to confirm that they want to receive administrative documents electronically. A list of these delivery service providers is published by the Federal Chancellor online. Registering with a delivery service is sufficient notice in order to receive administrative documents. However, the use of an electronic delivery service is not obligatory.</p><p>Since 1 January 2009, in accordance with §37 of the Act, before documents can be delivered using an individual 'electronic communication service from the authority', a delivery using an electronic delivery service has to be attempted first. Only afterwards is it allowed for deliveries to be sent out to recipients that are registered on the authority’s system. This includes cases in which an electronic delivery service cannot be used because the recipient is not registered with one.</p><p>Research Organisation Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10009514"><a id="_Hlk6320118"></a>Research Organisation Act</a> was amended on 16 May 2018 in order to facilitate the use of Information in public registers for research.</p><p>Delivery Service Regulation</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=20004204">Delivery Service Regulation</a> further defines the admission standards that are given in §30 of the Service of Documents Act. These standards include criteria for assessing the technical and organisational ability of delivery services and the reliability of data protection aspects in particular. The technical requirements that are to be fulfilled by delivery services are contained in an annex to the Delivery Service Regulation and are to be published online.</p><p><a href="https://www.digital.austria.gv.at/delivery-forms-regulation">Delivery Forms Regulation</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Gesetzesnummer=10005515">Delivery Forms Regulation</a> defines the forms for the first and second notifications which are sent electronically, as well as for the third and final notification which is sent by postal delivery to the recipient’s delivery address, if one has been provided.</p><p>Austrian Deregulation Act (2017)</p><p>On 12 April 2017, the <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXV/I/I_01457/index.shtml">Austrian Deregulation Act 2017</a> was published, which will bring a substantial reduction in the administrative burdens.

The law elaborates security measures already contained in the Data Protection Law 2000. The government worked together with the public administrations, as well as regional and local authorities in the development of the strategy.</p><p>eCommerce Act (2001)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokumente/Erv/ERV_2001_1_152/ERV_2001_1_152.pdf">eCommerce Act</a> (<em>eCommerce Gesetz</em>, ECG) which came into force on 1 January 2002 implements <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:178:0001:0016:EN:PDF">Directive 2000/31/EC</a> on electronic commerce. The Act deals with certain aspects of Information Society services. According to the Act, such Information Society services are – inter alia – online-distribution, online-information, online-advertisement, access services and search engines. The Act is therefore applicable to virtually all services provided on the Internet. It sets the principles of freedom of service provision and of country of origin and provides for certain information obligations of providers of information society services for the benefit of their (potential) customers.</p><h2>Interoperability </h2><p>eGovernment Act - Once Only Principle</p><p>Austria’s <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=BgblAuth&amp;Dokumentnummer=BGBLA_2004_I_10">eGovernment Act</a> contains a provision (§17 (2)) on the Once-Only principle, which states that “public authorities are obliged, pursuant to their technical possibilities and in compliance with the requirements stipulated by law, to draw on the available data of the person concerned from public registers of a client under public law”. Thus, certain information (birth certificates, proof of citizenship, proof of residency or documents from the Commercial Register) need no longer to be provided by the person concerned but can, with the person’s consent or with legal authorisation, be directly requested by the authority from an electronic register. The public authority's responsibility to enable queries in their registers in no way increases their authority to release information, since they are based solely on existing authorisations.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date. </p><h1><a id="__RefHeading___Toc8650355"></a>Digital Government Governance</h1><h2>National </h2><h3>Policy</h3><p>Federal Minister for Digital and Economic Affairs</p><p>The responsibility for Austria's eGovernment strategy/policy lies with the Federal Minister for Digital and Economic Affairs in the <a href="https://www.en.bmdw.gv.at/Ministry/Minister/Seiten/default.aspx">Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs</a>.

It provides information on all interactions with Austrian authorities required in the most frequent life situations such as pregnancy, childbirth, marriage or housing, and permits the electronic processing of some of these procedures. The portal constitutes an interface between authorities and citizens, with an emphasis on transparency, user-friendliness and clarity of information. HELP can be accessed 24/7 in order to obtain useful information on dealings with different authorities in approximately 200 life situations. It makes possible the processing of a large number of administrative procedures electronically <a id="_Hlk6322393"></a>via <a href="https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/">oesterreich.gv.at</a>. In January 2016, the portal recorded over 1.7 million visits. In addition, HELP offers foreign nationals and orientation guide in English. Structured in accordance with individual life situations (e.g. work, car, retirement pension), it provides information and support to foreigners who come to Austria in order to live and work. HELP aims to guide foreign users step by step through the required administrative procedures. </p><p>The HELP.gv.at website, which has been offering online services according to the one-stop principle since 2001, was relaunched on 15 August 2017. In addition to the numerous graphical and structural improvements of the one-stop-portal, the services in the registered area of HELP that are available via single-sign-on have been extended in the course of the relaunch. Including for example a data-safe (e-safe), the certificate of registration, the criminal record certificate, the transparency portal, the online services of the Austrian Ministry of Constitutional Affairs, Reforms, Deregulation and Justice, the central firearms-register, the online deregistration of place of residence as well as a virtual assistance or helpful online-forms.</p><p>Referring to the e-safe, the single sign-on functionality facilitates the secure archiving of important documents in the e-safe (mobile signature account) without having to register again separately.</p><p>The portal has received a number of accolades, including the 2007 Austrian Public Service Award, given by the Vienna Chamber of Commerce and Businessworld, and the eEurope eGovernment Award in 2003.</p><p>Since 22 March 2018 the HELP.gv.at has been expanded with the introduction of new services for citizens (e.g. baby point and relocation) and has been relaunched under the new name of <a href="https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/">oesterreich.gv.at</a>. A dedicated mobile app was also launched to facilitate a centralised, mobile and easy access for citizens to the most important administrative services.</p><p><a href="https://www.usp.gv.at/Portal.Node/usp/public">Business Service Portal (USP)</a></p><p>Since 1 January 2010, the Business Service Portal <a href="https://www.usp.gv.at/Portal.Node/usp/public">USP.gv.at</a> (<em>Unternehmens-serviceportal</em>), an initiative of the Federal Government, has been offering useful information on a wide range of topics that are of business interest. The portal aims to serve as a single-entry point for businesses to administrative services. By offering information (administrative activities, starting a business, tax and legal requirements) and transaction services, it intends to help businesses to fulfil their information obligations and to reduce their administrative burden. Information and advice are provided on administrative activities, including starting a business, tax and legal requirements. The information provided is based on the business content originally offered under HELP.gv.at, which has since been absorbed by the USP. </p><p>Legal Information System of the Republic of Austria (RIS)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/defaultEn.aspx">Legal Information System of the Republic of Austria</a> (RIS) is an electronic database operated by the Austrian Federal Chancellery which serves the<strong> </strong>publication of authentic legal texts as an alternative to the paper-based BGBl (Federal Law Gazette) and provides information on current laws in the Republic of Austria (e.g. in the form of a consolidated version of Austrian Federal Law).</p><p>Open Government Data Portal (data.gv.at) </p><p>Through the implementation and the start of the Austrian One-Stop Open Government Data Metaportal (<a href="https://www.data.gv.at/">data.gv.at</a>) in 2012, another obstacle on the path to a successful implementation of Open Government Data in Austria was eliminated. With data.gv.at a central catalogue for open government data in Austria was launched that aims to make it possible for users to quickly and simply find the required data via a single electronic point of contact. Open Government Data is seen as holding the potential for promoting social, cultural, scientific and economic progress in many areas in the long term. By making it possible to use non-personal information of the public sector, the development of new products and services is promoted. In addition, Open Government Data is seen as an appropriate tool to increase the transparency of administrative activities, to improve collaboration between politics, administration, business, research and citizens and to strengthen democracy. In 2014 data.gv.at was awarded the first place in the "Public Service Award of the United Nations" in the "Improving the delivery of public services" category. Altogether there were 4 categories, and Austria was the only European prize winner. </p><p>FinanzOnline portal</p><p><a href="https://finanzonline.bmf.gv.at/fon/">FinanzOnline</a> provides a one-click link to the Austrian tax administration. Using FinanzOnline, Austrian citizens can, for instance, file their tax return electronically from home 24 hours a day. Processing your employment tax return online saves both time and money. Upon request, assessment notices can be delivered electronically in just a few days. </p><p><a id="_Hlk6322695"></a>GESUNDheit.gv.at portal</p><p><a id="_Hlk6322695"></a>The guiding principle of the <a href="https://www.gesundheit.gv.at/Portal.Node/ghp/public">Health Portal</a> is to provide information to people in order to ensure and expand their participation and choices in the health care (i.e. patient empowerment). Accordingly, as available on this <a href="https://www.elga.gv.at/en/about-elga/index.html">portal</a> (My Electronic Health Records), quality-assured information about the healthcare system and other benefits is provided for citizens. Besides medical information, the portal also contains information on the structure and organisation of health services. </p><p>ICT security portal</p><p>At the address <a href="http://www.onlinesicherheit.gv.at/">www.onlinesicherheit.gv.at</a> citizens find an Internet portal with comprehensive information on the topic of ‘Security of information and communication technologies (ICT)’. The ICT security portal pursues the goal of promoting the ICT security culture in Austria through sensitisation and raising awareness among the target groups concerned and through the provision of target-group-specific recommendations for action.</p><h2>Networks</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p><a href="https://www.digital.austria.gv.at/electronic-delivery2">Electronic Delivery Service</a> </p><p>In 2008 and 2009, the first two privately run delivery services became operational conforming to the legal regulations and technical specifications for electronic delivery. Between 2004 and 2008, the Austrian Government operated an official electronic delivery service (<em>Zustelldienst</em>), designed to enable administrative procedures to be conducted by citizens from the application stage to delivery online. The service allows public administrations and citizens to exchange messages with the guarantee that messages are effectively sent and received. It provides users with the official acknowledgement of receipt, and registered mails delivered by the system have legal status. To subscribe to the service, a user needs to have a digital signature. The system is compatible with the Citizen Card. The official electronic delivery service is meant to gradually replace all paper-based notifications from public authorities to citizens and businesses. The specification of the Delivery Service has recently been extended and now includes the option to generate paper-based deliveries (e.g. by automated printing). This provides a single interface for the administration, but also alternative means of delivery for citizens and businesses. Currently, there are <a href="https://www.bmdw.gv.at/Digitalisierung/ElektronischeZustellung/Seiten/Zulassung-als-elektronischer-Zustelldienst-.aspx">five privately run delivery service</a>s on the market.</p><p>Electronic File System (ELAK)</p><p>The Electronic File system was introduced in order to replace paper-based filing and archiving in all Austrian ministries. An electronic file is created for every written request requiring an answer and every internal work of possible future interest. In this way, every procedure can be easily audited anytime by viewing the file. The electronic file system at federal level means that many procedures can now be conducted more efficiently facilitating inter-administrative transactions, which can now be processed using just one medium. The introduction of ELAK brought about significant savings.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p>Portal Group </p><p>The <a href="https://www.digitales.oesterreich.gv.at/portalverbund">Portal Group</a> is a link-up of administrative portals and the basic infrastructure for the authentication and authorisation of public sector employees when accessing restricted online resources. By implementing the Portal Group Protocol, the user management of shared eGovernment applications can be radically simplified, providing single sign for users. The operators of portals of the federal administration are obliged to implement the <a href="http://reference.e-government.gv.at/AG-IZ-PVV-pvv-1-0-Ergaenze.332.0.html">Portal Group Agreement</a>, building a web of trust. Participating organisations can use their own local user administrations for managing access to external eGovernment applications. </p><p><a id="_Hlk6322744"></a>Mobile Signature and Citizen Card</p><p><a id="_Hlk6322744"></a>To make procedures with public authorities both secure and traceable, public authorities must be able to verify a person's identity. An electronic tool is needed that can uniquely identify citizens and businesses. This electronic identification is the <a href="https://www.buergerkarte.at/">Citizen Card</a> (<em>Bürgerkarte</em>). The citizen card can also be used to sign documents securely and electronically. Since the implementation of the mobile phone signature (citizen card with mobile phone function) at the end of 2009, it is no longer necessary to have chip cards, card reading devices, or to install software on a local machine in order to use citizen card functionality. In comparison to other systems, the citizen card has many advantages. The normal username/password approach presents a high security risk due to poorly chosen passwords. Research has shown that many computer users select bad, easy to crack passwords (e.g., their own name) or write the passwords down. Passwords can also be intercepted on the Internet. All of these problems lead to unauthorised access. The 'digital signature' is covered by law and protects against unwanted access and changes to content.</p><p>The term 'citizen card' is used to describe an identity management concept that makes it possible to provide electronic services for public administration employees and customers in a simple and secure manner. Being the electronic identification in the Internet, the citizen card provides unique identification and authentication of users, which is necessary in order to offer certain electronic procedures. When the citizen card functionality is activated, for example free-of-charge on a citizen's e-card, two certificates and an 'identity link' is saved on the storage medium. The identity link establishes a link between the person and the storage medium. This enables the person to be identified at a later time. The authentication and signature certificates are used to encrypt and sign data and documents.</p><p>The requirement in the eGovernment Act specifying that the citizen card must contain a qualified electronic signature ensures the citizen card functionality. Together with it the electronic signature as the legal equivalent of a handwritten signature, has unlimited uses in business and international affairs.</p><p>Since the end of 2009 citizens are able to choose between two different citizen card options. The first is the well-known card-based option, in which an eCard is activated as a citizen card. Their other choice is a mobile phone solution called the <a href="https://www.buergerkarte.at/">Mobile Phone Signature</a> (<em>Handy-Signature</em>). The mobile phone signature (citizen card function on the mobile phone) was developed with support of the EU Commission in the large EU pilot project on interoperability of electronic identities called 'STORK'. It was activated during the last quarter in 2009. This solution makes it possible to use electronic signatures with a mobile phone. In contrast to the card-based citizen card, installing software and additional hardware (card reader) is no longer necessary. The mobile phone signature functionalities have been fully integrated in the recently launched <a href="https://www.oesterreich.gv.at/">one-stop citizen portal</a>, as well as in the associated <em>Digitales Amt</em> App which represents the mobile version of the portal</p><p>Since April 2016 the already established <em>Handy-Signatur</em> – for qualified electronic signatures and unique identification via web – is also available as a mobile app. Thanks to sophisticated security mechanisms the usage of the app is a highly secure und due to additional features (e.g. speed-sign function) a very user-friendly way across the digital world.</p><p>Signature Verification</p><p>The <a href="https://www.signatur.rtr.at/en/vd/Pruefung.html">Signature Verification</a> (<em>Signaturprüfung</em>) service is a web application with which it is also possible to verify electronic signatures without installation of a specialised software. The supported signatures are the internationally standardized formats such as XMLDSIG and CMS as well as formats used in Austrian eGovernment Applications (e.g. PDF-AS). The user interface is both in German and English, depending on the browser settings. In order to ensure confidentiality of communication, the service is encrypted.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p>PEP online </p><p>The <a href="https://www.pep-online.at/">public procurement platform</a> (PEP-Online) gives the opportunity to public buyers in Austria and Croatia to electronically provide interested suppliers with information about tender notices. Upon registration at <a href="http://www.lieferanzeiger.at/"><em>www.lieferanzeiger.at</em></a>, buyers have to enter the required information about a public procurement procedure into the system. A subsequent electronic verification ensures that all data is consistent and valid. Following this, the buyers have to specify the date and the media to be used for the publication, as well as to upload the tender documents. After registration at <a href="http://www.auftrag.at/"><em>www.auftrag.at</em></a>, interested suppliers are able to search the online database, view and download tender documents, visit a buyer's profile or define automatic search profiles. </p><p>BBG Portal</p><p>The BBG electronic purchasing system, which uses web technology by the <a href="https://www.bbg.gv.at/">Federal Procurement Agency</a> (<em>Bundesbeschaffung GmbH</em>), allows its customers to manage electronic framework agreements and contracts. The purchasing process (from raising a purchase requisition, approval workflows, completing the purchase order to dispatching the PO to the vendor), is covered within the <a href="https://portal.bbg.gv.at/">BBG Portal</a>. It simplifies and speeds up the internal processes by using flexible, customer-orientated electronic workflows. Furthermore, it improves the quality of business process documentation for registered users and their organisations. </p><h2>eInvoicing</h2><p>A specific plan at the federal level for the implementation of the <a href="https://standards.cen.eu/dyn/www/f?p=204:32:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:1883209,25&amp;cs=126F1BDBC8D6D6141F550EB578B4A9CF4">European standard on eInvoicing</a> has been put implemented, accepting the following formats: ebInterface, UBL 2.0 and 2.1, AustroFIX and CII D16B. </p><h2>ePayment</h2><p>No infrastructure in this field was reported to date. </p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p>MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) </p><p>Updated <a href="https://www.digitales.oesterreich.gv.at/-/staatssekretarin-duzdar-und-bildungsministerin-hammerschmid-mehr-internet-kompetenz-in-die-schulen">courses on internet competences</a> have been implemented at the teacher training colleges. The aim is to educate educators in using digital media in their lessons. The course is characterised by eight different topics: digital world for children and adolescents, behaviour around computer and internet, communication on the Internet, evaluation of online sources from the internet and copyright, digital devices in school, data protection, dealing with denigration on internet, cyberbullying and hate mailing.</p><p><a href="http://egovlabs.gv.at/">eGovLabs</a> - Joinup</p><p>Many eGovernment applications use modules for online applications (MOA), software components that encapsulate all the procedures needed to carry out specific functions, including verifying and affixing electronic signatures, reading identification data from the citizen card and delivering notifications from authorities. For this reason, the software is continually maintained in a collaborative process and upgraded to fulfil new requirements. For this purpose, the eGovLabs platform was created for the developer community so that feature and change requests, error reports and enhancements could be collaborated on in a structured manner. The modules and all their versions, including the source code, are available on this open source repository. In order to underline the European dimension and the cross-border usability, eGovLabs has been shifted to the EU <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/">Joinup</a> open source platform.</p><h2>Cross-border platforms</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date. </p><h2>Base registries</h2><p>Electronic Data Processing Register (‘DVR-Online’)</p><p>Since 1 September 2012, the <a href="https://dvr.dsb.gv.at/">Electronic Data Processing Register</a> is online in Austria that allows for a free and anonymous insight into public registries online. All data processing of every Austrian Data Controller can be requested without any previous registration or login. Furthermore, over time his online data processing register shall evolve to an important public compliance tool as it will allow the population (e.g. customers, employees, works councils, competitors or journalists) to retrieve the current register status concerning a specific Data Controller within seconds. The procedure of electronic filling/submission is furthermore enforced as it is mandatory, and submission of conventional paper-based forms is not accepted anymore. </p><p>EUCARIS, ECRIS and EULIS</p><p>Austria is a member of <a href="https://www.eucaris.net/countries/austria/">EUCARIS</a>, <a href="https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_criminal_records-95-en.do">ECRIS</a> and it also has full connection to the EULIS.</p><h1><a id="__RefHeading___Toc28_581311310"></a><a id="__RefHeading___Toc8650357"></a>Digital Government Services for Citizens </h1><p>The information in this section presents an overview of the basic public services provided to the citizens.
