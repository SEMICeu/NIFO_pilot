The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-226.png" alt="35-226.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Cyprus in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-268.x-emf" alt="35-268.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Cyprus’ results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 9 (Multilingualism) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). However, areas of improvement are concentrated in Principle 3 (Transparency) and 10 (Administrative simplification) whose score of 3 goes below the EU average. More specifically, Cyprus should further ensure internal visibility and provide external interfaces for European public services (Recommendation 5) as well as put more emphasis on simplifying processes and using digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of European public services, to respond promptly and with high quality to users’ requests and reduce the administrative burden on public administrations, businesses, and citizens (Recommendation 17).</p><p><img src="img/35-281.x-emf" alt="35-281.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Cypriot results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance with only scores of 4 in line with the European average, except for the recommendations related to the area of legal interoperability which achieved a score of 1. To further enhance Cyprus’ score in this area, the country should put in place ‘interoperability checks’ when it introduces new legislation in order to identify any barriers to interoperability. In addition, when drafting a new legislation, it should seek to make it consistent with relevant legislation, perform a ‘digital check’ and consider data protection requirements (Recommendation 27).</p><p><img src="img/35-293.x-emf" alt="35-293.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Cyprus’ scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an overall good performance in the implementation of all recommendations, aligned with the European average, except for the area related to the conceptual model itself. This is due to a lack of data for Recommendation 35, on the presence or not of a common scheme for the interconnection of service components and the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining European public services. Some areas of improvement have also been identified. Cyprus should, for example, where useful and feasible to do so, further use external information sources and services while developing European public services (External information sources and services – Recommendation 45) as well as.use trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services (Security and Privacy – Recommendation 47).</p><p>Additional information on Cyprus’ results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity:</strong> indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services:</strong> indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers:</strong> indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The strategy has a solid governance and KPI metrics to safeguard proper execution; 2021 is acknowledged as a pivotal year for enhanced digital fitness of the society, the entrepreneurial landscape and eGovernment transformation. The National Strategy for Digital Transformation includes the following pillars: </p><ul><li>Promote eGovernment by redesigning the Ministry’s enterprise architecture and governance model, optimizing our service delivery model, delivering a resilient, robust and secure ICT infrastructure; </li><li>Deliver a stronger digital economy and increasingly more digital and competitive industries;</li><li>Come up with a <a href="https://dec.dmrid.gov.cy/dmrid/dec/ws_dec.nsf/842BF8FCEECB2EE4C2258573002B58A9/$file/Broadband Plan 2021-2025_EN.pdf">National Broadband Plan</a> to facilitate high speed network connectivity and increase take-up;</li><li>Promote an accessible and inclusive society that has the skills and the motivation to embrace the national digital transformation and actively participate in digital communities; and</li><li>Ensure <a href="https://dsa.cy/strategy/csrc-2020">Security</a> in data and infrastructure and increase the trust of the public to the online transactions.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Digital Public Services</p><p>The Cypriot government has built a new delivery model for the development of end-to-end quality digital services, i.e. the Digital Services Factory (DSF) model, aiming to improve the quality of life for citizens and businesses by providing 100% of public services online. The provision of digital services to the public, in a user-friendly, efficient and effective way, will ultimately facilitate the interaction with public services, without the need for physical presence. The DSF will develop advanced digital services following an Agile/Scrum methodology, through redesigning and reengineering of procedures, and following a citizen journey that provides adaptability, response to change and is based on user experience. </p><p>In this context, a <a href="https://www.dmrid.gov.cy/dmrid/research.nsf/All/72B447F6352243DCC225863000314A52?OpenDocument">framework agreement</a> with the Government Digital Service (GDS) of the United Kingdom (UK) has been signed for the establishment of this new delivery model based on the UK example gov.uk. </p><p>Within the scope of the project, a DSF Multidisciplinary Team has been established in the DMRID. It works closely with GDS, aiming to deliver all the required prerequisites that would allow for the efficient provision of high-quality and user-friendly digital services to the public.</p><p>The plan is to achieve the provision of all public services online according to the standards and methodologies of the DSF. The target is to have the majority of public services online until 2026.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Skills Strategy</p><p>The National eSkills Action Plan was drafted by the DMRID and was finalised after consultation with the main stakeholders involved, namely the Ministries of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance; Finance (Cyprus Academy of Public Administration); Education, Culture, Youth and Sports, and the Human Resource Development Authority.

Digital skills are an essential prerequisite for learning, working and actively participating in a sustainable and competitive economy and in an open and inclusive society. Emphasis is given on actions related to meeting the growing needs of the labour market – both in regard to broad-based digital skills and ICT specialists – but also on redesigning the education system to better use digital tools in teaching and learning processes, cultivate the skills of the future and promote the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) career path.</p><p class="subtitle">Equity Fund</p><p>On 21 August 2019, the Council of Ministers decided the establishment of a public funded Equity Fund (thereafter called the ‘Fund’) in Cyprus, in the form of a regulated alternative investment fund. The State will initially provide EUR 20 million capital to the Fund with the possibility of attracting private co-investors, either at the level of the Fund or at the level of each investment separately. The purpose of the Fund is to offer alternative financing opportunities to the private sector: SMEs, start-ups, technology and innovation companies etc., thus boosting the competitiveness of Cypriot enterprises and enhancing growth and development.</p><p class="subtitle">Memorandum of Understanding in the Area of eGovernment between the Republic of Cyprus and Estonia</p><p>Major steps towards the implementation of eGovernment were taken with the signing of the <a href="https://e-estonia.com/estonia-and-cyprus-sign-e-governance-memorandum/">Memorandum of Understanding and Cooperation in the Areas of eGovernment and ICT.</a> The memorandum was signed by the President of the Republic Nikos Anastasiadis and the Estonian Prime Minister, Taaivi Roivas. The memorandum’s main objective is to develop cooperation in the areas of <strong>eGovernment and ICT</strong>, with a view to aiding Cyprus’ efforts to digitalise governance and public administration. Cooperation will focus on defining a strategic agenda along with the design and implementation of concrete actions, in order to develop the environment that will enable citizens to better access public sector information and services. The National eID project was one of the flagship projects where the expertise and experience of the Estonian government have been used. </p><p>Furthermore, the President of the Republic plans to sign an amended Memorandum of Understanding with the Estonian Prime Minister, during his visit in April 2022, where new areas of collaboration in the eGovernment sector will be defined. </p><p class="subtitle">Public Administration Reform (PAR)</p><p>The <a href="http://www.reform.gov.cy/en/">Public Administration Reform (PAR)</a> is considered a very important structural change aiming to create flexible, modern and productive public services for the benefit of both citizens and businesses.

In relation to the horizontal/cross-cutting issues, the reform of human resource management (HRM) across the public sector is planned. </p><p>More specifically, the government drafted and submitted to the House of Representatives legislative proposals which were approved in January 2022. The new legislation introduces in the public service a new system of appraisal and selection of candidates for filling the promotion posts in the public service from the year 2024 onwards, with different criteria and weights for each category of posts. The legislative changes aim to ensure the selection of the most suitable candidates and the most efficient implementation of the principles of objectivity and merit. It also introduces a new performance appraisal system for the performance appraisal of the employees based on specific criteria and a detailed framework of competencies/skills, according to their hierarchical level, starting from the annual evaluation for the year 2023. </p><p class="subtitle">Action Plan on Better Regulation</p><p>The third and final progress report for the Action Plan on Better Regulation that covered the period from 2015 to 2018 was submitted to the Ministerial Council in late 2019. This was followed by the formulation of the new Action Plan on Better Regulation, which covers the period 2019–2022. </p><p>The new <a href="https://issuu.com/presidency-reform-cyprus/docs/sxedio_drasis_ke_pinakes_gia_veltio?e=23693381/33573909">action plan</a> was approved by the Council of Ministers on 6 November 2019. The plan consists of three priority axes:</p><ul><li>Simplification of procedures and legislation and reduction of the administrative burden;</li><li>Better law-making and impact assessment (IA) of new legislation; and </li><li>Embedding the culture and enhancing relevant skills in relation to the Action Plan on Better Regulation.</li></ul><p>The IA mechanism, put in place in 2017 to undertake more focused and thorough IAs for new legislation, was embedded and is now a mandatory part of the legal drafting procedure. An IA report summarising the main findings and suggestions for the way forward was published in 2018. Its intention was to continue the training programme of government officials and further enhance the implementation of the new IA framework.</p><p>Further to the above three axes, the action plan also included actions that are being promoted under the pillar of eGovernment, which go hand in hand with the other Better Regulation initiatives.</p><p class="subtitle">Operational Programme ‘Competitiveness and Sustainable Development’ </p><p><a id="_Toc1474959"></a><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>The promotion of ICT use is one of the seven priority axes of the 2014–2020 OP ‘<a href="http://www.dgepcd.gov.cy/dgepcd/dgepcd.nsf/page09_en/page09_en?OpenDocument">Competitiveness and Sustainable Development’</a>. The budget of the axis is around EUR 40 million (6% of the OP’s total budget), which is co-financed by the European Regional and Development Fund (ERDF) with EUR 33.5 million.

The budget that has been made available for the implementation of the strategy is currently around EUR 6.5 million for 2022, although the Steering Committee of the strategy is following a dynamic approach, and has the ability to request additional budget each year depending on the needs identified (i.e. further budget will be identified and allocated for 2023 and 2024).</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle">eGovernment in Education</p><p>In June 2018, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport and Youth officially launched a programme on the design and implementation of eGovernment in Cyprus’ education. </p><p>One of the main objectives was the implementation of the <a href="http://www.moec.gov.cy/monada_tpe/en/administrative_procedures_management_sector_sms.html">School Management System</a> (SMS) project, a computerised system intended to standardise and accelerate bureaucratic processes. The SMS is a crucial element of the restructuring plan of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sport and Youth, which aims to create an advanced computerised system that will ensure proper information management and process automation. The SMS will contribute to the streamlining of bureaucracy, the reduction of high administrative costs and it will ensure the prompt provision of information, cooperation and support of various stakeholders. The different services offered by the SMS will be gradually introduced until the expected ending date of the project in 2023. The total cost for the implementation of the system is around EUR 10 million, which will be co-financed by both national resources and the ERDF 2021–2027. </p><p>In support to this project, a number of tablets were delivered to all upper secondary schools in 2020, in order to prepare, empower and develop the digital skills of the educators for the application of the SMS. </p><p class="subtitle">National Coalition for Digital Jobs</p><p>Cyprus has drafted a holistic <a href="http://www.digitaljobs.cyprus-digitalchampion.gov.cy/el/page/home">action plan</a> aimed at the enhancement of digital skills across all population groups (public administration, enterprises and society at large), as well as the promotion of STEM education and professional paths, so as to effectively address the market shortage in ICT professionals. The goal is to deliver an open, accessible and inclusive digital society, able to actively participate in socioeconomic activities, fully reap the benefits of digital transformation and act as a driver for an accelerated digital transition. It includes actions aimed at the integration of digital skills in the educational system and the alignment of educational curricula with industry needs, the upskilling and reskilling of both the public and the private sectors, and the promotion of a culture of life-long learning and innovation.</p><p>In addition, Cyprus is developing a dynamic, easy-to-use and accessible eLearning platform, containing a self-assessment tool for digital fitness, an index of all available skilling programmes, and content material on digital skills and cross-sectoral competences such as project management. </p><p class="subtitle">Reform of the Justice System (eJustice)</p><p>The reform anticipates qualitative changes to the justice system with the goal of strengthening the flexibility, effectiveness, and speed of the decision-making process. As part of the reform, an electronic court administration system will be introduced to digitalise the operations of the different courts. To this end, a tender to purchase a license for a web-based court administration system (eJustice system), including training of personnel, and the option to acquire the system by the government, was launched. The eJustice system will be installed in the premises of every court in Cyprus, and it will be possible to manage all procedures of a legal case. Additionally, the eJustice system will provide electronic services to court personnel, law offices, police, governmental departments, private law companies, lawyers, the bar association, private companies, citizens and private service provides (e.g. audit firms, land development companies, certifying officers etc.). </p><p>The implementation phase is expected to be completed by June 2022, followed by 6-month pilot phase. On successful completion of the pilot phase, an SLA agreement will be activated, and the system will be deployed for production. The production phase will last 6 years and the government will pay a monthly fee as a license to use. This monthly fee will also cover the helpdesk, maintenance and small-scale changes/ improvements of the system. The government has the right to extend the production phase for an additional 4 years or to purchase the system.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p class="subtitle">National Strategy on Artificial Intelligence</p><p>Τhe Council of Ministers in Cyprus approved the <a href="https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/cyprus_ai_strategy.pdf">National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> in January 2020.

The G-Cloud will be implemented in the premises of a datacentre provider (Tier3 datacentre) and not in government premises. Initially, the G-Cloud will be used by a limited number of Departments and Ministries of the government, but it will be continuously improved and extended in order to cover most of the existing Systems or other upcoming needs. In parallel, the G-cloud will be expanded to become a hybrid cloud, allowing the use of public cloud resources when suitable. The project is at the initial phase and it is getting prepared for the procurement phase.

Each country is responsible for its own registry of vehicle and driving licence information and its own registration procedures. Through their <a href="https://rtd.mcw.gov.cy/WebPhase1/gui/Common/LoginFrameGreek.jsp?lang=en">national registration authority</a>, other government institutions can request information on e.g. vehicles from another country. The system contributes, amongst others, to the fight against car theft and registration fraud.</p><p>EUCARIS is a system on which several applications run, such as RESPER (<em>Réseau permis de conduire</em> / Driver’s License Network), ERRU (European Register of Road Transport Undertakings), CBE (Cross Border Exchange), etc., all serving a different legal basis, such as the EUCARIS Treaty, EU Council decisions and several bilateral Treaties. </p><p class="subtitle">National Visa Information System (CY-VIS)</p><p>On 22 May 2019, the Council of Ministers approved the submission of a revised Declaration of Readiness Assessment for the full accession of the Republic of Cyprus in the Schengen Area. The existence of a new Cyprus Visa Information System (new CY-VIS) (harmonised to and updated with the latest technical EU requirements) is one of the most important preconditions within the framework of the requirements that has to be met before joining the area. An efficient visa information system is also necessary to handle the number of visa applications received, which will potentially increase.</p><p>The new CY-VIS of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also aim at a better implementation of the common visa policy, consular cooperation and consultation between central consular authorities, facilitating the exchange of data between Member States on visa applications and related decisions. More analytically, the new CY-VIS will fully comply with the Schengen Acquis and simplify the application process and the time required for the issuing of a Visa via a Web based solution. This will result in:</p><ul><li>Greater transparency and faster procedures for visa travellers to enter Cyprus and, in the future, the Schengen Area;</li><li>The safety and protection of travellers using biometric technology, helping to identify individuals and prevent identity theft;</li><li>Consular cooperation and consultation between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other authorities;</li><li>A reduced risk of "visa market" and fraud;</li><li>A more streamlined processing of visa applications, which is one of the Cypriot national requirements, and</li><li>Flexibility to support the future evolutions of the system in view of changes to the European or the National legislation.</li></ul><p>The respective open tender procedure documents will be published within the first trimester of 2022 and is expected to be awarded in the third trimester of the same year.</p><h2>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Interconnecting EU Land Registers</p><p>The Department of Lands and Surveys is one of the main Base Registries in Cyprus. In 2018, data exchange (property searches) became available for all governmental departments through the Government Data Warehouse. In rare instances, this can also be done through web services (system-to-system).</p><p>The Department of Lands and Surveys is implementing the INSPIRE Directive, and the requirements of the eJustice portal to connect the European Land Registers.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Registry of Sworn Translators</p><p>On 1 July 2019, the current system of certified translations provided by the Press and Information Office was terminated, according to <a href="http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/indexes/2019_1_45.html">Law No. 45 (Ι)/2019</a>, which provides for the registration and regulation of the services of the sworn translators in Cyprus. In order to facilitate the public’s access to the registry of sworn translators, a <a href="https://www.pio.gov.cy/en/register-of-sworn-translators.html">digital Registry</a> is available which functions as a search engine.</p><p class="subtitle">Road Transport Department Registry</p><p>The Road Transport Department is one of the base Registries in Cyprus as it is responsible for the vehicles’ and drivers’ digital registry. Data exchange became available for all governmental departments through the Government Data Warehouse and, in some instances, it can also be done through web services (system-to-system) via the Government Gateway - Ariadni. In addition, data exchange is available to other EU countries through EUCARIS, which uses the TESTA network.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Platform for Energy Performance Certificates</p><p>In the framework of the Law that regulates the energy performance of buildings, a national Registry for Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) and a Registry for Qualified Experts have been introduced. An EPC has to be issued by a qualified expert for new buildings and buildings that are for sale or for rent. The Issuing of an EPC can be done only through the digital platform for EPC. Qualified experts can access the platform through the Ariadne Getaway Government Portal. Furthermore, the platform is used by qualified experts to register and to renew their registration. MECI is currently working on the digitalization of the registries of all independent experts’ and installers related to energy efficiency and renewable energy.</p><h2>Emerging Technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>Involvement in the European Blockchain Partnership </p><p>Cyprus has been actively participating in the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/blockchain-partnership#:~:text=The European Blockchain Partnership (EBP) helps avoid fragmentation of the,deployment of blockchain-based services.">European Blockchain Partnership</a> (EBP) and the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) since 2018. Moreover,  the <a href="https://www.cysec.gov.cy/en-GB/home/">Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (the “CySEC”) has been operating an innovation hub since 2018, promoting DLT/blockchain in the financial sector. In addition, a regulatory sandbox project was included in Cyprus’s Resilience and Recovery Plan. Cyprus is among the few early adopters of the EBSI: it is currently implementing a CEF-funded project whose aim is to establish a fully operational national EBSI Infrastructure and develop a cross-border Diploma Blockchain Use Case and wallet. The project has been showcased repeatedly to other EBSI European projects.</p><h3>Big data</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud computing</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance computing</h3><p>No infrastructure has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle">Broadband infrastructure objectives</p><p>The Government of Cyprus achieved the first target of 100% coverage of the country with broadband infrastructure, using <strong>DSL broadband network</strong>, installed by the incumbent telecommunications operator offering a speed of at least 2 Mbps.</p><p>Cyprus has already included in the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF) a series of investments and reforms and is also planning to submit proposals for CEF2 digital infrastructure funding in the next programme period. An important part of the new broadband plan is to expand the Very High-Capacity Networks (VHCN) infrastructure by using EU funding and focusing on digitally excluded, rural and suburban areas. At the same time, the socio-economic drivers such as schools, hospitals, research and business centres, universities, ports, airports, stadiums and other underserved areas with limited speed internet access, located throughout the country, will be connected to symmetric gigabit speeds.</p><p>Another major project is the deployment of submarine fibre cables connecting Cyprus to Greece as well as other non-EU countries. This project is expected to boost the capacity and resilience of the backhaul infrastructure in Cyprus and lead to reduced prices for high-speed broadband services, which will benefit end users, both through fixed and mobile networks. Meanwhile, the Department of Electronic Communications (DEC) implemented demand-stimulating measures as part of the 2019-2020 national broadband plan. Specifically, to increase the very low take-up of very high-capacity connections, the DEC launched in 2019 a ‘Pilot’ voucher scheme, using national funds, aimed at all people in Cyprus, which subsidised broadband connections of at least 100Mbps.<a id="_Toc30514844"></a></p><p><img src="img/35-771.jpeg" alt="A picture containing text, computer, person, indoor
