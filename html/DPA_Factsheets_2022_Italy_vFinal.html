The following measures will be put in place by 2026: </p><ul><li>Reinforcing the adoption of existing national platforms such as PagoPA, enabling transactions from and toward the public administration, and the mobile application App IO, a unique point of access to many services for citizens; introducing the single digital notification platform, allowing to send digital notifications with legal value.</li><li>Strengthening the Italian Digital Identity System: SPID and CIE, converging toward an integrated and user-centric solution and increasing the number of digital public services accessible through it; improving user experience and accessibility; harmonising different public administration practices toward high-quality standards.</li></ul><p><strong>Objective 2: Digital skills</strong></p><p>The digitalisation of public services and infrastructures is reinforced by measures promoting the development of citizens’ digital skills and ensuring solid and pervasive digital literacy. More traditional investments in education programs, platforms and infrastructure that cover the entire educational patterns of citizens are foreseen. Beside those, the Digital Civil Service (youth volunteering program) and the Digital Facilitation Services will allow 3 million citizens to develop basic digital skills, therefore bridging the digital divide.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Objective 3: Cloud and infrastructure </strong></p><p>The digital transition of public administration follows a cloud-first approach that is oriented toward the migration of single administrations’ data and software in a cloud environment. Such a process will consolidate and rationalise many existing data centres, starting from those that do not fulfil the minimum safety, reliability and efficiency requirements (95% of the 11 000 data centres used by public administrations). Two alternative models are envisaged for central administrations: i) migration toward the National Strategic Pole (<em>Polo Strategico Nazionale</em> - PSN: new strategic cloud infrastructure, hybrid or private), or ii) migration toward the ‘public’ cloud of a certified market operator. In addition, Italy will put in place a programme supporting and incentivising the migration of local public administrations to cloud. </p><p><strong>Objective 4: Digital Online Services</strong></p><p>At the basis of public administration digitalisation lies the architecture and interconnection of administrations’ databases, which contribute to save time and resources for citizens and enterprises. The full interoperability of public administrations’ databases will extend the use of digital identity and digital domicile. The <a href="https://www.pagopa.it/it/prodotti-e-servizi/piattaforma-digitale-nazionale-dati">National Digital Data Platform</a> (PDND) <a href="https://www.pagopa.it/it/prodotti-e-servizi/piattaforma-digitale-nazionale-dati">https://www.pagopa.it/it/prodotti-e-servizi/piattaforma-digitale-nazionale-dati</a>  will allow the creation of a unique ‘digital profile’ that follows the Once-Only-principle and will guarantee the interoperability of public sector information through a central catalogue of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) shared across central and local administrations. Public and private entities will be able to use in an authorised and certified way the published APIs (eServices) in compliance with EU privacy laws. These eServices will enable the harmonisation with other EU countries of the service procedures prioritised by the Single Digital Gateway Directive. Semantic and syntactic interoperability of the eServices will be supported by the <a href="http://www.schema.gov.it">National Data Catalogue for Semantic Interoperability</a> (NDC) <a href="http://schema.gov.it">schema.gov.it</a>.</p><p><strong>Objective 5: Ultrafast networks</strong></p><p>To comply with the Gigabit society’s promise of high-quality fixed and mobile connectivity infrastructures, a technology neutral approach will be adopted. Italy therefore plans to put in place the following:</p><ul><li>Italia a 1 Giga: 1 Gbps connectivity to 8,5 million families, agencies and enterprises in grey, black, market failure and remote areas;</li><li>Scuola Connessa: 1 fibre Gbps connectivity to 9 000 remaining schools;</li><li>Sanità Connessa: from 1 to 10 Gbps connectivity to 12 000 SSN centres;</li><li>Collegamento Isole Minori: submarine fibre backhauling to 18 minor islands;</li><li>Italia 5G: developing 5G infrastructure in mobile areas at market failure (only 3G available, no 4G or 5G investments planned).</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Three-Year Plans for IT in the Public Administration </p><p>The <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/">Three-Year Plan for IT in the Public Administration</a> was defined in accordance with the <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/en/faqs/">Digital Growth Strategy</a>, with the aim of targeting public sector ICT investments according to government guidelines and in line with European goals and programmes. The plan proposes a systematic, distributed and shared management and use model applicable to the most innovative digital technologies. This approach would be characterised by an agile and evolutionary management style, based on clear governance of the various levels of public administration. The synergy and balance between the three pillars (innovative technologies, agile management style and clear and effective model of governance) ensures the country is more effective in benefiting from new technologies and provides citizens with an advantage in terms of ease of access and improvement of existing digital services.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.agid.gov.it/">AgID</a> is in charge of executing the plan and coordinating the support to central and local public administration bodies in the implementation of the plan.</p><p>In March 2019, the Italian government approved the <a href="https://pianotriennale-ict.italia.it/assets/pdf/2019-2021/Piano-Triennale-ICT-2019-2021.pdf">2019-2021 Three-Year Plan for Information Technology in the Public Administration</a>. The plan provided for initiatives to accelerate the transition to digital administrations and local entities and to empower citizens and businesses in being active protagonists of innovation.</p><p>The plan outlined the actions needed to promote the digital transformation of the public sector, moving in the same direction defined by the 2017-2019 plan. In particular, the new plan:</p><ul><li>Supported the inclusive path of digital growth of national and local governments, with greater involvement of the key actors of the digital transition;</li><li>Defined the fundamental architectural principles, the interoperability rules of national infrastructures, and the cooperation model between different ecosystems and platforms;</li><li>Facilitated the relationship between public administration bodies and the market, also involving private actors in the development of integrated and interoperable services; and</li><li>Introduced a novel perspective to understand the digital transformation, with a particular focus on identifying the areas of intervention and the impact on the main actors (citizens, businesses and public administration bodies).</li></ul><p>In October 2021, the Department for Digital Transformation and AgID published a new version of the <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/it/agenzia/piano-triennale">Three-Year Plan for ICT in Public Administration (2021-2023)</a>. Representing the natural evolution of the previous three plans, the new plan is an important instrument to foster digital transformation in the country, particularly when considering the digitalisation of public administration. The fourth plan will  focus on the implementation of the actions outlined in the previous plans, while monitoring the results that have been achieved to date. Additionally, the updated plan puts forward some new elements related to the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR) and the supervision of the digital transformation targets for the public administration at all levels. The plan has three main objectives:</p><ul><li>The development of a digital society where digital services put citizens and businesses at the centre;</li><li>The promotion of ethical and inclusive development; and</li><li>The spread of new digital technologies within the Italian productive ecosystem while fostering standardisation, innovation and experimentation in the provision of public services.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Cloud Strategy </p><p>In September 2021, together with the National Agency for Cybersecurity in 2021, the DTD published the <a href="https://innovazione.gov.it/progetti/infrastrutture-digitali-e-cloud/">Italian Cloud Strategy</a> (Cloud Italia), which sets out the path for public administrations, including local ones, to move to the cloud. The target is the migration to the cloud of 75% of Italian public administrations by 2026.</p><p>Promoting the adoption of secure, efficient, sustainable and reliable data processing infrastructures, the strategy aims to overcome a long-standing weakness of the Italian public administration. At the core of the approach, there is the identification of risks linked with different public data and service types and the most suitable cloud delivery modes (public, hybrid or private) to mitigate those risks. </p><p>The strategy is structured along the following lines: </p><ul><li><strong>Certification process</strong> of cloud services: the objective is to provide an ex-ante certification scheme for cloud services that can be purchased by the public administration while ensuring that these services are in line with the necessary requirements of security, reliability and compliance with the relevant regulations and the country’s national interest.</li><li>The development of a <strong>taxonomy</strong> to classify data and services managed by public administrations: data and services can be classified as ‘strategic’, ‘critical’, or ‘ordinary’ depending on the potential threats they would likely pose to the country if they were to be compromised. Based on this taxonomy the most appropriate cloud delivery mode will be selected.</li><li>The creation of the <strong>National Strategic Hub</strong> (NSH) or <a href="https://innovazione.gov.it/dipartimento/focus/polo-strategico-nazionale/#il-progetto-di-creazione-del-psn"><em>Polo Strategico Nazionale</em></a> (PSN): a national data processing infrastructure for hosting cloud services for ‘strategic’ and ‘critical’ public administrations’ data, across interconnected data centres geographically distributed throughout the country. The NSH should ensure the highest levels of reliability, resilience and independence for the storage of critical public administrations’ data. A call for tenders for its implementation was launched in January 2022. The expected impact is 75% of Italian public administrations using cloud services by 2026. On 28 January 2022, the first call for tender was published. The successful tenderer is required to invest EUR 723 million for the provision of ‘public’ and ‘private’ cloud services. </li></ul><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and the Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Italian government signed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and the Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus reaffirming its commitment – together with other EU Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies.

The plan is the outcome of complex coordination work of all institutional and civil society representatives on ten thematic areas:</p><ol><li>Open data;</li><li>Transparency;</li><li>Register of beneficial owners;</li><li>Support to participation;</li><li>Regulating access of stakeholders to decision-makers in public administration;</li><li>Culture of open government;</li><li>Corruption prevention;</li><li>Simplification;</li><li>Digital services; and</li><li>Digital citizenship and skills. </li></ol><p>Along the most consolidated sectors of open government – open data, transparency, digital skills and services – the plan presents new measures on consultation policies, the register of beneficial owners and regulations on stakeholders, proving that opening processes are now mature.</p><p>The Fourth Action Plan relies upon two main innovations ensuring a higher quality of commitments compared to the previous action plans. First, the involvement of the Open Government Forum represented a key element as both public administration bodies and civil society organisations were able to discuss and agree upon the objectives to be achieved by 2021. Second, the final document shifted from a high number of actions implemented by single administrations to a smaller number of actions shared by different administrations. This enabled a more efficient convergence of the actions and the optimisation of resources.</p><p>In May 2020, the Italian government <a href="https://www.opengovpartnership.org/news/canada-italy-and-kenya-elected-to-to-guide-the-open-government-partnership/">was appointed</a> as member of the Steering Committee of the Open Government Partnership. Hence, as a member of the committee, the Italian government played an important role in bringing together governments, the civil society and all the other stakeholders to guarantee an open and effective response to the COVID-19 crisis.</p><h3><a id="_heading=h.35nkun2"></a><a id="_Toc109838105"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date. </p><h3><a id="_heading=h.1ksv4uv"></a><a id="_Toc109838106"></a>Security aspects </h3><p class="subtitle">Cybersecurity in the PNRR</p><p>Digitalisation increases the vulnerability of society that may face the risk of multiple cyber threats, such as frauds, blackmailing and terroristic attacks.</p><p>Four national measures will reinforce the implementation of the <a href="https://www.gazzettaufficiale.it/eli/id/2019/11/20/19G00140/sg">Cybersecurity National Perimeter</a> PNSC (D.P.C.M. no. 131 of 30 July 2020 on the Regulations regarding the National Cybernetic Security Perimeter was published in the Official Gazette no. 261 of 21 October 2020 and will enter into force on 5 November 2020):</p><ul><li>Reinforce front-line controls for better alert management and to face previously identified risky events against PAs or enterprises of public interest;</li><li>Build and empower audit and evaluation technical skills to guarantee the highest safety of electronic applications and devices that derogate essential services;</li><li>Increase the amount of human resources in public safety and judiciary police, responsible for detecting and investigating cybersecurity threats directed to single citizens or to the country; and</li><li>Strengthen assets and units responsible for protecting national security and for responding to cyber threats.</li></ul><h3><a id="_heading=h.44sinio"></a><a id="_Toc109838107"></a>Interconnection of base <a href="https://www.sicurezzait.gov.it">registries</a></h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date. </p><h3><a id="_heading=h.2jxsxqh"></a><a id="_Toc109838108"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date. </p><h2><a id="_heading=h.z337ya"></a><a id="_Toc109838109"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle">Connected School</p><p>This <a href="https://bandaultralarga.italia.it/scuole-voucher/dashboard-scuole/">project</a> aims at completing the intervention started in 2020. Its goal is to provide free Internet connection for 5 years (fibre optic with at least 1 Gbps symmetric speed) to approximately 35 000 schools (out of a total of 40 000), with maintenance and assistance services. The total planned investment is over 400 million euros. On this point, it should be noted that on 21 January 2021, the European Commission formally approved the Italian aid scheme of 325 million that will allow 12 000 schools to have an ultra-fast Internet connection. The measure will also help students and educators in the context of the Coronavirus pandemic by giving them access to current and future online educational tools. This Commission decision allows the use of public funds to provide very high-speed Internet services to schools in areas where private investment is insufficient. The measure that Italy notified to the Commission concerns only schools where broadband network with download speed exceeding 300 Mbps is not available nor is it planned to be implemented in the near future. It is possible to understand the status of operation from the system dashboard on the institutional website of Infratel Italia S.p.a. with the indication of the buildings in the georeferenced map and the relative connection status.</p><p>With reference to the PNRR, the Connected Schools measure, with a total budget of 261 million euros, aims to complete the intervention described above, providing the remaining 10 000 school buildings throughout the country with free 1 Gbit/s symmetric connectivity as well as related technical assistance, management and maintenance services for 6 years.</p><p>At the end of 2021, over 6 000 school buildings were connected under the existing school plan.

In particular, the measure, with a budget of approximately 3.7 billion euros, aims at covering the real estate units that, according to the mapping exercise conducted, have not been covered (currently and up to 2026) by networks capable of providing at least 300 Mbit/s download speed under usual peak-time conditions.</p><p>The Italian Government, in compliance with the rules defined by the European legislation on state aid, must ensure that public intervention is limited to market failure NGA areas, i.e., those where there are no infrastructures capable of reaching, in reasonable times, the connectivity performance of 300 Mbps download speed under usual peak-time conditions that is necessary to meet user needs as defined in the strategy. Therefore, the Italian Government must ensure that public investments do not overlap with the private investment plans already envisaged by operators. The first step in defining the exact scope of intervention under the Italy at 1 Giga Plan was updating the mapping exercise concerning the ultrabroadband fixed networks in grey and black areas) as well as in the so called 2016 white areas. The outcome of the mapping was shared with the stakeholders as part of the public consultation in which the target areas, as well as the other characteristics of the measure, were precisely indicated, including the public intervention model.</p><p>In January 2022, the request for State aid was approved, and the tenders for the realisation of the networks was launched. The deadline for awarding the tender is 30 June 2022. After the award, the first households will start being connected according to the service requirements mentioned above.</p><p class="subtitle">Minor Islands Plan</p><p>The plan aims to provide adequate connectivity to 18 smaller islands that today have no fibre optic connectivity with the mainland. In particular, the islands will be equipped with optical backhaul that will allow the development of ultra-broadband connectivity. The optical backhaul will be accessible to all operators through the Submarine Backhaul Access Point, identified according to the shortest distance from the neutral delivery point (NDP), if present on the island, and from the landing point of the submarine cable. The overall budget for this Plan is € 60.5 million. The measure will be implemented through direct intervention models. The new network will be fully funded and owned by the State and will be managed by one or more operators, selected on the basis of a competitive, open, transparent and non-discriminatory selection process. The following islands have been identified: Capraia, Favignana, Lipari, Stromboli, Alicudi, Panarea, Filicudi, Salina, Lampedusa, Linosa, Pantelleria, Ustica, Ponza, Ventotene, Asinara, Tremiti Islands, Pelagie Islands, Sulcitanee islands.</p><p class="subtitle">Italy 5G plan</p><p>In order to better address public initiatives aimed at the creation of networks able to provide innovative and high-performance mobile services, this plan is complementary and synergetic with respect to the national 5G networks development plan already started and the coverage obligations of mobile radio operators, in compliance with the constraints imposed by the rules on State aid. In particular, the plan, with a budget of 2.02 billion euros, aims to encourage the development of 5G mobile networks in market failure areas, in order to fully satisfy the needs for a mobile connectivity that can enable the multiple use cases envisaged by the ITU, related to the three categories, namely enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB), massive Machine Type Communication (m-MTC), and Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), which together represent a real technological breakthrough that has led to consider 5G as the ‘evolution and revolution’ of mobile radio systems.</p><p>To this end, the plan envisages two distinct and complementary lines of action: a) the implementation of fibre optic backhauling for mobile base stations that, based on the plans declared by the operators during the mapping stage, will not have fibre backhauling by 2026; b) the implementation of new network infrastructures providing mobile radio services with adequate performance to satisfy user needs in areas where, on the basis of the mapping exercise, the downlink speeds expected by 2026 is less than 30 Mbit/s under usual peak-time conditions.</p><p>During 2021, a detailed mapping exercise was carried out, involving mobile operators, aimed at understanding the current and expected (by 2026) characteristics and performance of the mobile networks connections based on the investment plans declared by the mobile operators. The public consultation on the plan was carried out between 15 November and 15 December. Taking into account the results of the public consultation, in the first months of 2022 a request for State aid was submitted to the European Commission. After the approval by the Commission, the tender will be launched, in order to select the operators who will build the networks. The deadline for awarding the tender is 30 June 2022. After the award the deployment phase will begin.</p><p><img src="img/35-636.jpeg" alt="A picture containing floor, indoor
