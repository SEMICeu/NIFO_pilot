The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below. </p><p><img src="img/32-183.png" alt="P57#yIS1" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for the Netherlands in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-206.x-emf" alt="P61#yIS1" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 202</a>2</p><p>The Netherlands’ results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles. Principle 3 (Transparency) is the only Principle below the EU average, highlighting that the country should further ensure internal visibility and provide external interfaces for European public services. Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and 9 (Multilingualism) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups, leveraging commonly agreed e-specifications (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) and the use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Principle 9 – Recommendation 16) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p><img src="img/32-221.x-emf" alt="P65#yIS1" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 202</a>2</p><p>The Dutch results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an excellent overall performance with all criteria scoring 4, in line with the EU average. Semantic interoperability represents an area of possible improvement. In this context, the Netherlands should further enhance the way it perceives data and information as a public asset that should be appropriately generated, collected, managed, shared, protected and preserved (Recommendation 30). </p><p><img src="img/32-236.x-emf" alt="P70#yIS1" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 202</a>2</p><p>The Netherlands’ scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with all components, except the Conceptual model itself. Particularly, the country could improve its score by further using the conceptual model for European public services to design new services or reengineer existing ones and reuse, whenever possible, existing service and data components (Recommendation 34).</p><p><img src="img/32-251.x-emf" alt="P73#yIS1" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 202</a>2</p><p>The available results of the Netherlands concerning Cross-border interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show a high performance of the country in 7 indicators. Particularly, even though the lack of data for some indicators does not allow for a complete analysis, the Netherlands has a high performance above the EU average in Principle 10 (Administrative simplification) and Security and Privacy. However, the country still has margin for improvement in relation to Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and should ensure that all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups. For digital public services, public administrations should comply with e-accessibility specifications that are widely recognised at European or international level (Recommendation 14).</p><p>Additional information on the Netherlands’ results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p><a id="_Toc1474951"></a></p><p><img src="img/32-265.png" alt="P89#y1" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc140675790"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications </h1><h2>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">NL Digibeter: Digital Government Agenda</p><p>The  NL Digibeter:<a href="https://www.nldigitalgovernment.nl/digital-government-agenda/">Digital Government Agenda</a> is closely connected to the broader <a href="https://www.nederlanddigitaal.nl/english/dutch-digitalisation-strategy">Dutch Digitalisation Strategy</a>.

The NL AIC is a public-private partnership with over 400 organisations in which the government, the business sector, educational and research institutions, as well as civil society organisations collaborate to accelerate and connect AI developments and initiatives. The ambition is to position the Netherlands at the forefront of AI knowledge and application for prosperity and well-being, with due observance of both Dutch and European standards and values. </p><p>To strengthen the position of the Netherlands and to make the most of the opportunities, a long-term programme called <a href="https://ained.nl/en/">AiNED</a> has been drawn up by the NL AI Coalition. The programme accelerates the development and application of AI so that the Netherlands can reap the economic and social rewards of AI and keep pace with other leading countries. The Netherlands has invested EUR 276 million in the first part of this programme, focusing on innovation AI projects and labs on ethical, legal and societal aspects (ELSA labs). Ahead of this programme several Ministries, including the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations, funded an <em>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</em> (Dutch Research Council, NOW) call in the <em>Nationale Wetenschapsagenda </em>(Dutch Research Agenda, NWA) programme for ELSA labs.

The Netherlands Publication Office (KOOP) is responsible for site maintenance and development. Over 185 Dutch government organisations list their available data in about 16,051 datasets. The data portal is updated daily by harvesting processes, API updates and individual users. The DCAT standard for data exchange is used and has been extended for use in the Netherlands (<a href="https://data.overheid.nl/IPM-Datamodel">DCAT-AP-NL</a>). Version 1.1. is currently in use. The data registry is based on the <a href="http://www.ckan.org/">CKAN software platform</a> and Drupal 8.

This results in a single closed virtual government network. Within that network, government bodies are able to securely exchange data. Diginetwerk provides connectivity and increases efficiency, because one organisation requires just one connection to be able to exchange data with various government organisations.</p><p class="subtitle">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><p>The Netherlands makes frequent use of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/testa_en">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA)</a> network as the main cross border infrastructure to communicate digitally among EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Data Exchange Services of the Base Registers System </p><p>The smart exchange of data from the system of base registers enables the government to operate more efficiently and to improve its service. Four system services support base registries in their aim to offer their catalogue of products and services to users in a consistent way. The system of base registries identifies the following system services, namely, <a href="https://www.logius.nl/diensten/digilevering">Digilevering</a>, <a href="https://www.logius.nl/diensten/digimelding/">Digimelding</a>, D<a href="https://www.logius.nl/diensten/digikoppeling">igikoppeling</a> and <a href="https://www.logius.nl/diensten/stelselcatalogus/">Stelselcatalogus</a>:</p><ul><li>Digilevering distributes up-to-date and accurate key registry data to key registry clients in the shape of event messages, for instance the relocation of a company, the birth of a person, or a change in somebody’s income. Each recipient organisation is responsible for determining which data are relevant;</li><li>Digimelding: the information stored in key registries has to be up-to-date and reliable. One of the tools used to guarantee the quality of the key registries is Digimelding (digital notification), which enables users to report back. All base registries users have a legal duty to report any mistake in their data they may be aware of. Reporting back contributes to efficient operations management within the government, improves the level of service, and increases the opportunities to fight fraud;</li><li>Digikoppeling sets out interface standards and contains agreements for the exchange of messages between authorities. One Digikoppeling implementation in an IT-environment enables users to exchange messages with all authorities, and to join nearly all generic functions of the digital government basic infrastructure, for instance the key registries. Governmental as well as private organisations performing a public task can use Digikoppeling; and</li><li>Stelselcatalogus: the System Catalogue lists data contained in the base registries system, what they mean, and how they are interconnected.

With SBR the Dutch Government and businesses in the Netherlands have come to an agreement regarding the way accountability information is being reported. This leads to an undisputed set of financial information.</p><p>The SBR is already operational. The following organisations accept or require the SBR: Tax and Customs Administration (e.g. Value Added Tax, Corporation Tax Return), Chamber of Commerce (annual reports), Central Statistical Office (production and investment statistics), and banks (annual credit reports). In 2022, 61 reporting types based on the SBR framework were in use, adding up to a total of 48 million SBR messages exchanged.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">DigiD</p><p>In the eID approach, public and private authentication solutions coexist. The public solution for citizens (DigiD) is reserved for G2C authentications. The policy aims at strengthening DigiD in two ways: on the one hand by introducing new certificates on ID cards and driving licences to have a higher level of trust, and on the other hand by accepting private authentication solutions under strict conditions in order to promote resilience.</p><p>DigiD enables individuals to identify themselves for digital services. DigiD offers security: you know who you are dealing with. Using DigiD, the Citizen Service Number (BSN) of the person logging in is disclosed. This makes it possible to check the information already on file for that individual and offer personalised services. At this moment, logging in involves a user name and a password, and in some cases a text message for further verification. In July 2017 the <a href="https://www.digid.nl/over-digid/app/">DigiD App</a> was launched. </p><p>DigiD is available at three levels: </p><ul><li>Basic (user name and password: DigiD); </li><li>Medium (DigiD + sms-authentication or using the <a href="https://www.digid.nl/over-digid/app/">DigiD app</a>), which both represent a stork QAA level 2; and</li><li>Substantial (the DigiD app upgraded with an ID verification), stork QAA level 3.</li></ul><p>Although it is not mandatory by law yet, DigiD has become the main authentication system for citizens.</p><p class="subtitle">DigiD Authorise</p><p>DigiD Authorise enables users of a digital service to authorise someone to act on their behalf. This can come in handy if the user is not familiar with using computers or digital services or wants to defer the task to someone who is more knowledgeable in the subject matter. DigiD Authorise users do not need to disclose their own DigiD to the person they authorise and grant the authorisation only for one specific service. In 2022, companies and organisations made 12.689 requests for the use of DigiD authorisations. </p><p class="subtitle">Administrative Facility BSN</p><p>The administrative facility citizen service number (<em>Beheervoorziening burgerservicenummer</em>, BV BSN) is in charge of generating, issuing, managing and consulting the citizen service number (BSN). The BV BSN controls access to the identifying data in the underlying authentic registries (Municipal Key Registry Personal Data, or GBA in Dutch, and the Non-Residents Records Database). It also controls access to the verification registries for identity documents to verify identity at the counter. </p><p class="subtitle">eRecognition</p><p><a href="https://www.eherkenning.nl/">eRecognition</a> (<em>eHerkenning</em>) is the eIdentity Trust Framework enabling authentication for government agencies and businesses. With an <em>eHerkenning</em> authentication token, users can log in to online services offered by government agencies and businesses. Authentication tokens are technology neutral; therefore, a range of options is available for users (e.g., SMS, OTP, certificate, user name/password). The four assurance levels provided by STORK are reused within eHerkenning in combination with a registry of mandates: users have to be mandated by their organisation for the tasks they are allowed to perform.

It contains frameworks and existing agreements for the lay-out of the Dutch governmental information management system. Realising services within the scope of these frameworks and agreements ensures smooth cooperation with other services, and optimal re-use of existing solutions. All government parties have endorsed the NORA. (NORA 3.0). Through the NORA, their organisations know the relevant agreements needed for cooperation and improvement of their services. By adhering to the design principles and standards, IT solutions meet the cohesion and standardisation demands. The NORA provides a framework for eGovernment components acknowledged by all stakeholders. Partners can use it to accelerate development in their organisations to a common framework. For the use of mandatory and recommended open standards, the NORA maintains a persistent link to the standards lists of the Standardisation Forum.</p><p class="subtitle">‘User Needs First’ Community</p><p><a href="https://www.gebruikercentraal.nl/">Gebruiker Centraal</a> (loosely translated as ‘User Needs First’) is a community of professionals working on digital government services. The project strives for a more user-friendly digital government for everyone, also people with functional impairments. It promotes and share (practical) knowledge about the use of plain language. Furthermore, it provides tips and tricks for making governmental websites and processes more accessible. Within this project there are multiple communities. Each community has a certain subject it is interested in and shares knowledge about. Examples of these subjects are plain language, customer experience and design thinking. People that participate in these communities work at various levels of government (national, regional and local). </p><p class="subtitle">Open Standards</p><p>The Dutch government promotes open standards to ensure interoperability, supplier independency and increased internet security. In the Netherlands, some open standards are mandatory on a ‘comply or explain’ basis, while some internet standards will be legally mandatory in the upcoming Digital Government Law (<em>wet Digitale Overheid</em>) or all public services. Others are recommended. The Standardisation Forum has published a <a href="https://www.forumstandaardisatie.nl/open-standaarden/lijsten-met-open-standaarden">list of open standards</a>. To ensure the use and adoption of open standards, such as electronic exchange and internet security.
