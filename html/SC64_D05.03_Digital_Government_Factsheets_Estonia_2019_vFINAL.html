A newly revised, updated<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12900546">Public Information Act</a> entered into force on 1 January 2015. It started the transposition of the provisions of the revised Directive (2013/37/EU) into national law. The Act covered State and Local Agencies, legal entities in public law and private entities that are conducting public duties including educational, health care, social or other public services. Any person could make a request for information, which was registered; the holder of information had to respond within five working days. Fees were waived if the information was requested for research purposes. Departments and other holders of public information were required to maintain websites and post an extensive list of information on the Web. These entities were also required to ensure that information was not outdated, inaccurate or misleading. In addition, email requests were treated as official requests for information. The Act was enforced by the <a href="http://www.aki.ee/en/inspectorate">Data Protection Inspectorate</a>. Since 1 January 2008, the Act has also been regulating the field of the former <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/32230">Databases Act</a> (in force from 1997 to 2007). </p><p>The Public Information Act covered the provisions of the EU Directive <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0098:EN:HTML">2003/98/EC</a> on the re-use of public sector information (PSI). Estonia thus notified the full transposition of the PSI-directive in July 2009.

The Act set the principles for collecting, evaluating, archiving, preserving, accessing archival documents and for archiving activities. It set the guidelines for private records entered in the archives' register and the transfer of ownership of private records also entered in the archives' register.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474966"></a>Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act </p><p>The new <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/527102016001/consolide">Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act</a> adopted on 12 October 2016, constituted the effective transposition of the EU’s eIDAS regulation.

Its purpose was to strengthen the security of digital systems used in providing vital and other socially important services to the public. The Act provided for the requirements for the maintenance of network and information systems essential for the functioning of society and state and local authorities’ network and information systems, liability and supervision as well as the bases for the prevention and resolution of cyber incidents.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474967"></a>Personal Data Protection Act </p><p>The first <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112072014051">Personal Data Protection Act</a> (PDPA) entered into force on 19 July 1996. The Act was amended in 2003, to be made fully compliant with the EU Data Protection Directive <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML">95/46/EC</a>, and <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12909389">amended</a> again in January 2008 and <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/523012019001/consolide">renewed</a> in 2019. The Act protected the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons with respect to the processing of their personal data, in accordance with the right of individuals to obtain freely any information that is disseminated for public use.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12909389">2008 version</a> of the Act introduced several changes. Firstly, the previous classification of personal data into three groups (non-sensitive personal data, private personal data and sensitive personal data) was replaced by two data categories: 'personal data' and 'sensitive personal data', the latter being the sub-class under special protection. Secondly, all processed personal data are protected and registered by Chief processors (i.e. controllers) with the <a href="http://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a>, the data protection supervision authority. Moreover, the new PDPA Act extends all general principles applying to the processing of personal data and to the processing of the personal identification code (the unique number assigned to every Estonian citizen and resident). </p><p>From 1 January 2015, the Data Protection Inspectorate may submit reports concerning significant matters which have an extensive effect or need prompt settlement which become known in the course of supervision over compliance with the Act to the Constitutional Committee of the Riigikogu and the Legal Chancellor.

It established the system of security measures for information systems used for processing the data contained in state and local government databases and for information assets related therewith. The system consisted of the procedure for the specification of security measures and the description of organisational, physical and IT security measures to protect data. However, it was underlined that this Regulation does not apply to the security of information systems processing state secrets.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474968"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle">Estonian Base Registries</p><p>The concept of a base registry has been phased out in Estonia. Instead, the basic data principle is used.

Hence, in Estonia all registries are base registries concerning unique data collected in respective registries.</p><p>Furthermore, registry interconnection has been implemented between the business registries of Estonia and Finland with the use of X-Road infrastructure. The Secretary General of the Ministry of Justice Tõnis Saar and the Director General of the Finnish Patent and Registration Office Antti Riivari signed an agreement in February 2019 in Helsinki, under which data can be exchanged automatically between the business registers of the two countries. National legislation did not need to be changed for that purpose.</p><p class="subtitle">Business Registry</p><p>The Business Registry is covered by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/128122011050?leiaKehtiv">Commercial Code</a> and its <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/504042014002/consolide">Amendment</a>.

The Act on Amendments to the <a href="https://www.riigikogu.ee/tegevus/eelnoud/eelnou/667615bb-4a13-4a02-812f-550c5dedeef3/Raamatupidamise seaduse muutmise seadus">Accounting Act</a> (795 SE), initiated by the Government, made machine-processable invoices mandatory in invoicing with the public sector. The amendments aimed to reduce the workload and the time required in invoicing with the public sector. The European Union Directive on eInvoicing was also transposed. An electronic invoice is a machine-readable document drawn up on the basis of a common standard, sent from one software system to another to avoid entering data by hand.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474969"></a>Domain-specific legislation</h2><p class="subtitle">Information Society Services Act </p><p>The Information Society Services Act <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/504112013008/consolide/current">Information Society Services Act</a> was passed on 14 April 2004 and entered into force on 1 May 2004.

The Act enabled a physical person to open a business account from which 20% would automatically go to the Tax and Customs Board. Therefore, they exposed themselves to the Tax and Customs Board and in return, the account holder need not submit annual reports and submit tax returns.</p><p class="subtitle">Principles for Managing Services and Governing Information </p><p>In June 2017, the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/507072017004/consolide">Principles for Managing Services and Governing Information</a> (a Government Regulation) entered into force obliging all authorities to ensure:</p><ol><li>Management and quality of the direct public services;</li><li>Management and quality of the processes;</li><li>Information governance and quality thereof;</li><li>Every sub-activity of information governance and quality thereof of the authority.</li></ol><p>With this Regulation, Estonia adopted a new approach to developing public services. From now on public services must be life-event based and where possible, pro-active. Estonia is currently developing a methodology on how to develop and offer such public services.</p><p>This Regulation obliged authorities providing public services to maintain an up-to-date list of its own direct public services and of the support services provided to other authorities, containing at least significant services. Furthermore, the management of the processes behind the services must have a clear owner. The problem that authorities often face is that they do not have a clear view of their services (as defined in the second article of the Regulation). </p><p>The Regulation also established a web of coordinators:</p><p>The <a href="https://www.mkm.ee/en">Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications</a> is responsible for the management of direct public services, including upon determination, sharing and exchange of the information necessary for providing such services;</p><p>The <a href="http://www.aki.ee/en/inspectorate">Data Protection Inspectorate</a> in organising access to and protection of information;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/">Estonian Information System Authority</a> for the implementation of the requirements for the architecture of the state information system and for the key components of the state information system.</p><p>The coordinators, while executing their tasks, have the following functions:</p><p>Planning the main directions of development and the activities supporting development;</p><p>Issuing guidelines and recommendations;</p><p>Monitoring the implementation of planned activities and application of guidelines;</p><p>Managing communication;</p><p>Cooperating with other coordinators;</p><p>Engaging other parties as necessary.</p><p>The Regulation aims to establish a common view how to develop, maintain and provide high quality public services.</p><p class="subtitle">Regulation on Cross-Border Exchange of Information Regarding Health services </p><p>In November 2018, the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/120112018003">Regulation regarding cross-border exchange of information regarding health services</a> came into force. The purpose of the regulation was to enable people abroad to have better access to medical care and medicines thanks to electronically exchanging prescription data between countries. Estonia and Finland became the first two countries in Europe to exchange medicine prescription data. As of January 2019, the first EU patients could use digital prescriptions issued by their home doctor when visiting a pharmacy in another EU country: Finnish patients are now able to go to a pharmacy in Estonia and retrieve medicine prescribed electronically by their doctor in Finland. The initiative applies to all ePrescriptions prescribed in Finland and to the Estonian pharmacies that have signed the agreement. The novelty of this initiative is that the ePrescriptions are visible electronically to participating pharmacists in the receiving country via the new eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure, without the patient having to provide a written prescription.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474970"></a>Interoperability </h2><p class="subtitle">Public Information Act </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/503012019004/consolide/current">Public Information Act</a> set out various elements related to interoperability.

Since then, the portal has been constantly renewed. In the last quarter of 2007, a new version of the portal merged the former ‘State Information Portal’ and the ‘Citizen Portal’, creating a single<strong> </strong>integrated service. This portal coordinates the information provided and the services offered by various State institutions. It features a safe Internet environment for communication with the State and offers reliable information and<strong> </strong>eSolutions<strong> </strong>for citizens, entrepreneurs and officials respectively. The access to relevant information and eServices on the portal depends on whether the user is a citizen, entrepreneur or State official. </p><p>The State portal’s environment allows users to authenticate with their national eID card to: access and check their personal details; perform transactions with municipal and Government bodies; complete and convey online forms and applications; sign documents digitally; create email addresses with the suffix @eesti.ee; and receive email or SMS notifications. In addition, it gives access to other registry services (e.g. the Forest Registry) on more than 20 national databases. Based on the data held in the State Commercial Register, entrepreneurs using the portal can access transactional services<strong> </strong>for businesses.</p><p>The eesti.ee portal, the gateway to government information and eServices, was renewed in 2018.</p><p class="subtitle">DigiDoc Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://digidoc.sk.ee/?f=chg_lang&amp;lang=en">DigiDoc</a> portal is available for Estonian ID-card and Estonian and Lithuanian Mobile-ID users.

It makes it possible to carry out authentication based on strong authentication devices from different vendors and provides service providers with the opportunity to enter legal signatures on any created data within their service. This provides long-term validity and proof of action in courts across the EU.</p><p class="subtitle">Rural Municipality Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kovtp.ee/">portal</a> was launched in February 2011 by the Estonian Government, with the view to increase the transparency of local governments and expand citizen participation. The concept of the portal is innovative as it is based on an open source content management tool, which allows for easy and uniform site administration. The developed solution includes a standard website structure for local governments, tools for site administration and built-in interfacing with public registers.</p><p class="subtitle">Open Data Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://opendata.riik.ee/en/">Open Data Portal</a> provides a single point of access for general public to unrestricted public sector data with the permission to re-use and redistribute such data for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

It is a Government-wide backbone network, connecting more than 20 000 computers from all Government offices across the country, providing secure access to the Internet and the Government's Intranet. The network was launched in October 1998, and its development was based on the backbone network ASONet elaborated by the Border Guard Administration, the Customs Board and the Police Board in 1993. The network currently provides approximately 50% of all administrative services to the various associations. </p><p>The Estonian Information System Authority (RIA) is highly involved in running the network, either as a mediator of customised value-added data services, or as a provider of customer service. The use of the backbone network is financed centrally from the State budget and is free-of-charge for subscribed clients. Clients only have to pay to access the backbone network and to determine the access connection service themselves. </p><p class="subtitle">Administration System of the State Information System (RIHA)</p><p>The objective of <a href="http://www.ria.ee/index.php?id=27314">RIHA</a> is to ensure the interoperability<strong> </strong>of public sector information systems and the re-use of technical, organisational and semantic resources, so as to give a clear view of the State registers and the services provided by them. The creation and maintenance of Government databases is governed by the <a href="http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/X40095K2.htm">Public Information Act of 2007</a> which established an Administration System for State Information Systems (RIHA), where all the databases and information systems must be registered.</p><p>RIHA includes metadata about existing public sector databases – ranging from the information on the administrators of the databases to the eServices offered and the technical data concerning the environment/platform. Registration in RIHA is web-based; the user is authenticated, and permissions are given by using the national electronic ID card. </p><p>In the same web-based environment, requests to other information systems can be made in order to launch<strong> </strong>a<strong> </strong>new X-tee-based service. RIHA additionally administers two supporting systems of State registers: the system of classificators and the address data system. The system of integrated registers allows applying new principles of administrative arrangements: citizen-orientation, flexibility, swiftness, as well as cost and time effectiveness for both the citizens and the State.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">X-Road Middleware</p><p>Launched in December 2001, the <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/state-information-system/x-tee.html">X-Road</a> (referred to as <a href="https://www.ria.ee/et/riigi-infosusteem/andmevahetuskiht-x-tee.html">X-tee</a> in English since 2018) is a middle-tier data exchange layer enabling Government databases to communicate with each other. It was initially developed as an environment facilitating the formulation of queries to different databases in a standardised way. The system allows officials, as well as legal and natural entities to search data from national databases over the Internet within the limits of their authority, using a unified user interface.</p><p>In addition, the system has been further developed to enable the creation of eServices capable of simultaneously<strong> </strong>using data held in different databases. Several extensions have thus been developed for the X-tee system. These include: writing operations to databases, transmitting huge data sets between information systems, performing successive search operations of data in different data sheets, providing services via web portals. </p><p>The X-tee, as one of the cornerstones of the Estonian State Information system, offers the following services: authentication; authorisation; MISP (mini-portal system); register of simple queries; queries to various databases and registers; opportunities to write registers; sending large amounts of data over the Internet; secure data interchange, recording logs and search tracking option; running of citizen portal and operator's portal; central and local monitoring and collection service description in a special database (WSDL mode).</p><p>The data exchange layer of information systems X-tee serves as main interoperability solution inside Estonia. The use of X-tee is the mandatory solution for data exchange between public sector information systems.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic ID card</p><p>Estonia started issuing <a href="http://www.id.ee/?lang=en">national ID</a> cards in January 2002. The card, which fulfilled the requirements of Estonia’s Digital Signatures Act, now replaced by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/527102016001/consolide">Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act</a>, is mandatory for all Estonian citizens and residing foreigners of over 15 years of age. It is meant to be the primary document<strong> </strong>for identifying citizens and residents and is used in any form of business – governmental or private communications. It is furthermore a valid travel document within the EU. Since 1 January 2007, the card issued by the Citizenship and Migration Board, has become valid for 5 years (instead of 10 years in the past). The ID-card can be <a href="http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/economy-a-it/e-estonia.html">used</a> to vote electronically (since 2005), create a business, verify banking transactions, be used as a virtual ticket, and view medical history (since 2010). As of January 2012, more than 1.1 million people in Estonia (almost 90% of inhabitants) have ID cards. </p><p>In addition to being a physical identification document, the card has advanced electronic functions facilitating secure authentication and providing a legally binding digital signature for public and private online services. An electronic processor chip contains a personal data file, a certificate for authentication (along with a permanent email address Name.Surname@eesti.ee for eCommunications with the public sector), a certificate for digital signature, and their associated private keys, protected with PIN codes. The certificates contain only the holder's name and personal code (national ID code). The data file is valid as long as the identity card is, and so are the certificates, which have to be renewed every five years. </p><p class="subtitle">Mobile-ID</p><p><a href="http://id.ee/?lang=en&amp;id=36881">Mobile-ID</a> is the ID-card based identity verification and digital signature solution for users of mobile phones in Estonia. This means that the mobile phone, based on a standardised SIM application, will act as a secure signing device. Thus, similarly to the eID card, the mobile-ID enables authentication<strong> </strong>and digital signing of documents, bearing the same legal value. The user’s certificates are maintained on the telecom operator’s SIM card; to use them, the user has to enter a PIN code.</p><p>The mobile-ID service (wireless PKI) was launched in May 2007 by the mobile operator <a href="https://www.emt.ee/en/liitu">EMT</a>, in co-operation with several banks and the Certification Centre, <a href="http://www.sk.ee/en"><em>AS Sertifitseerimiskeskus</em></a>. This service allows accessing Internet banking services without entering eBanking codes. To authenticate oneself securely with the mobile-ID, the user will click on a dedicated button in the web environment. Upon completion of this action, s/he will be requested to enter his/her authentication PIN number. Once this operation has been completed, authentication is performed. The same process applies to the signing of digital documents. In addition, mobile phones can be used to pay for car parking <a href="http://e-estonia.com/component/m-parking/">(m-parking)</a> by phoning a certain number or sending an SMS. To inform the parking controller that the payment is being affected by phone, an m-parking sticker is stuck on the windshield or the right-side window of the vehicle. The m-ticket service allows the user to purchase a ticket on public transport without cash. It is also possible to buy theatre tickets and pay at the grocery store using a mobile phone.</p><p>The main advantages of the mobile-ID include user-friendliness and<strong> </strong>convenience; the computer no longer needs to be equipped with a card reader, or have a special additional software installed. </p><p class="subtitle">Smart-ID</p><p>Estonia has a new private sector-offered solution for secure authentication as an alternative to Mobile-ID, called <a href="https://www.smart-id.com/">smart-ID</a>. Smart-ID can be used to log in to e-services, for online banking and for signing documents. Signatures given with Smart-ID are legally binding, recognised in all EU states and have the same legal effect as handwritten signatures.  </p><p class="subtitle">ePassport</p><p>To comply with EU regulation <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R2252:EN:HTML">2252/2004/EC</a> on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States, the systems of the Estonian Citizenship and Migration Board (CMB) have undergone considerable changes that have been implemented step-by-step.
