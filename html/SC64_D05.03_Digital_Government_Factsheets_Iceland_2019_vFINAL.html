Digital Post refers to the possibility that governments communicate electronically-only with citizens or entrepreneurs through e.g. personal mailboxes or other digital mail solutions.</li></ul><p>These top-level benchmarks are measured using a life-events (e.g. mystery shopping) approach.

The four key objectives of the current Icelandic cybersecurity strategy are the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Capacity building</strong>: the public, enterprises and government should have the knowledge, skills and equipment needed to cope with cyber security threats.</li><li><strong>Increased resilience</strong>: key factors in enhanced resilience are greater capacity in the fields of assessment, preparedness and response.</li><li><strong>Strengthened legislation</strong>: legislation should reflect the international demands and obligations the country undertakes regarding cyber security and the protection of personal data; and it must also support innovation and the development of security-related services like hosting. </li><li><strong>Tackling cybercrime</strong>: the police should have access to the professional knowledge, skills and equipment needed to resolve issues concerning cyber security.</li></ul><p>A special Cyber Security Council has been appointed, consisting of representatives of the government bodies involved in the implementation of the strategy, in order to put the cyber security strategy into action.

Icelandic State and Municipal Policy on the Information Society 2013-2016</a>, which<strong> </strong>states that the necessity of access to public sector information and databases should be a priority with the aim of giving the general population opportunities to monitor public sector activities while encouraging innovation and the reuse of public sector information for commercial purposes. It continues stating: “The general public, businesses and stakeholders shall have easy access to non-personal information and files kept by the State or municipalities. The basis for State and municipal policies shall be openly accessible data, providing a single portal for accessing such data or databases.” At the beginning of 2013, digital maps and spatial data held by the National Land Survey of Iceland were made available free of charge.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p class="subtitle">A unique IT supplier for the entire public sector</p><p>On the 1 June 2019, Iceland became the first country to sign a contract which will make Microsoft the sole IT supplier for its entire public sector. The country teamed up with a single IT partner for the provision of a common cloud platform, Microsoft 365.</p><p>The introduction of Microsoft 365 will consolidate all services into a single license, as well an increased communication and collaboration between institutions. </p><p>“The contract with Microsoft marks a paradigm shift in the way we understand the public sector and public services. As more countries digitize their public services, they experience an increase in demand from other institutions and employees as well as from citizens. This increases the need to streamline and strengthen services, products and processes, not to mention the level of security. Iceland is not afraid of being a front-runner, and that is quite admirable,” said Peter Quarfordts Skov, Director, Public Sector at Microsoft Denmark &amp; Iceland.</p><p>Even if the decision could lead to an increased interoperability among different public bodies, the risk of a vendor lock-in is higher.</p><p class="subtitle">National Interoperability Framework</p><p>National research on improving interoperability indicated that further interoperability could only be achieved through comprehensive harmonisation and communication between systems, concluding the need for strategies and corresponding frameworks. Hence, Iceland published a draft <a href="http://samvirkni.ut.is/">National Interoperability Framework</a> that has been made available for public consultation and started the process of setting up the NIF with a focus on the technical level of interoperability, followed by semantic and organisational interoperability. Several parties are involved in the establishment of the framework including all government levels, the public institutions and private entities. Iceland believes in a broad stakeholder engagement to actively stimulate the usage of open standards. It has a specific process to define these standards in collaboration with standardisation bodies, together with all interested parties in all layers of government and the public. It is expected that the NIF is to play a bigger role in the next policy on the Information Society.</p><p>Since access to data and information is still in silos, Iceland is further developing plans to reform public administration and services. In the program Iceland 2020, there is a particular focus on exploring ideas for multi-functional state and municipal service centres at a local level (one-stop shops).</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h1><a id="_Toc12873494"></a>Digital Government Legislation</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474962"></a>Specific legislation on digital government</h2><p class="subtitle">Information Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.government.is/library/01-Ministries/Prime-Ministrers-Office/information-act-no-140-2012.pdf">Information Act</a> was approved by the parliament at the end of 2012 and came into force on 1 January 2013.
