It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below. </p><p><img src="img/35-164.png" alt="35-164.png" />Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation.

The country scored even above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and 9 (Multilingualism). Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) and the implementation of evaluation mechanisms to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of interoperable solutions (Principle 12 – Recommendation 19) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4.  </p><p><img src="img/35-197.x-emf" alt="35-197.x-emf" /> </p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021 </a></p><p>The Finnish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall good performance, scoring 4 in most layers.

This strategy will guide and enhance the renewal of public governance as a whole from 2020 to 2030. In particular, it seeks to strengthen good governance across the country and in both national languages and, more specifically, to improve digital accessibility and encourage wider use of plain language in administration. A consistent and determined renewal of governance as described in the strategy will streamline everyday services, ensure legal certainty in society, and create new opportunities for businesses and communities. </p><p>The direction and means of administrative reform were defined together with various administrative sectors, municipalities, civil society, researchers and numerous stakeholders to agree on the goals and future policies around public governance in the 2020s. The participatory process of preparing the strategy has therefore played an important role in strengthening cooperation between the State, municipalities and future welfare regions, and the interaction between governance and the rest of society, as well as in building a common understanding of the need and direction of public governance development.</p><p>The implementation actions of the Strategy for Public Governance Renewal in 2021–22 include networking projects, events and development work that foster the achievement of the goals set in the strategy and inspire dialogue between different actors, increasing the knowledge base through studies and analysis, and competence renewal through education and training. </p><p class="subtitle">Climate and Environment Strategy for the ICT Sector</p><p>The Climate and Environment Strategy for the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Sector, Finland’s first strategy of this kind, was published on 9 March 2021.

More in general, the purpose of the national Climate and Environment Strategy for the ICT Sector is to promote ecologically sustainable digitalisation, and support the achievement of the climate and environment objectives. The strategy will be implemented by a wide range of parties, both public and private. The Ministry of Transport and Communications, and the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency (Traficom) monitor the implementation of the strategy in partnership with stakeholders. An annual forum is arranged to support this process.</p><p>As for the most recent developments in this context, Finland introduced legislation that promotes waste heat utilization in data centres by providing a tax relief for those data centres that deliver their waste heat for utilization. In addition, several research projects are going on in Finnish universities and research institutes, including a project that maps the climate impacts of the digitalisation of public services and a project called ICA – ICT for the benefit of the environment.

Through the development of these elements, public procurement can achieve economic, social and ecological sustainability. </p><p>As of spring 2022, the strategy was progressing according to plan. Nearly 30 measures, including measures to promote green and low-carbon procurement, information management and digitisation, innovative public procurement, employment through procurement, procurement expertise and the role of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and human rights in procurement processes, had been completed or were in progress. </p><p>Overall, around 500 public and municipal procurement professionals, representatives of tender companies, researchers and representatives of various expert organisations are actively participating in the eight thematic groups focused around the eight strategic common goals. The thematic groups are open to all and the number of participants representing the different stakeholders is increasing steadily.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p>Government Resolution on Digital Logistics</p><p>In its Resolution on Digital Logistics, the Finnish government outlined measures aimed at a more efficient, safer and climate-friendly transport. In particular, the measures aim to make more efficient use of information in transport chains and hubs. To that end, a key priority in the digitisation of logistics is to develop the existing national information environment as part of the EU-wide data space development in the transport sector. In this context, electronic consignment notes will guide logistics operators to move toward digital data exchange. In addition, as a key measure Finland appointed a Logistics Digitisation Forum to ensure data sharing in supply chains. The members represent the logistics and transport services and digital solutions sectors, other key sectors in industry, commerce and other service branches as well as ministries and authorities.</p><p class="subtitle">National Transport System Plan for 2021–2032</p><p>The <a href="http://urn.fi/URN:ISBN:978-952-383-804-8">National Transport System Plan for 2021–2032</a> is a strategic plan for developing the transport system.

The technical infrastructure, called AuroraAI network, aims to create the technical conditions enabling smooth interaction and communication, and interoperability between different services and platforms, as the Artificial Intelligence Programme’s report of 2017 suggested. In addition to the AuroraAI network, the programme is developing an operating model to arrange public services in a way that they can support people in their life events and organisations in their business activities, in collaboration with service providers in other sectors. The model will provide public organisations with tools and examples to develop their operations in a way that enhances human-centricity and the use of the AuroraAI infrastructure. </p><p>The aim of the programme is to deploy the first version of the AuroraAI network and the operating model by the end of 2022. The programme is implemented together with stakeholders from State agencies, municipalities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and academia.  </p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Big data</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Cloud computing </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT) </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance computing</h3><p>Involvement in High-performance Computing</p><p>Finland signed the European High-Performance Computing (EuroHPC) Declaration in 2018.
