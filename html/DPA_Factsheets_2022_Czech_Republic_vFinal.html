The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below. </p><p> </p><img src="img/35-218.png" alt="35-218.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021 </a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Czech Republic in 2021.</p><img src="img/35-277.png" alt="35-277.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Czech Republic’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall very good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and 9 (Multilingualism) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Particularly, the accessibility of public services to all citizens (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) and the use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing public services could be bettered to reach the European average of 4 for Recommendations 14 and 16. </p><img src="img/35-290.png" alt="35-290.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Czech results for the implementation of the interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows an overall good performance with scores of 3 and 4.

Precisely, the lack of catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions put in place with common models describing them (Catalogues - Recommendation 44) and the low use of external information sources and services while developing European public services (External information and services – Recommendation 45) hinder the overall Czech score on the conceptual model.</p><p>Additional information on Czech Republic’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The NEN is a complex electronic tool for the administration of public procurement and concessions for all categories of contracting authorities. To date, 600 contracting authorities are required to use the NEN mandatorily, and 900 contracting authorities use the NEN on a voluntary basis, i.e. regions and municipalities. The implementation of the NEN as a central eProcurement solution contributed to the transparency of public procurement, and to significant savings. </p><p>National eInvoicing Forum</p><p>Since 1 April 2020, all public contracting authorities have been obliged to accept eInvoices issued based on European standard EN 16931-1:2017. According to government Resolution No. 347/2017, the national standard for eInvoicing <a href="https://www.mvcr.cz/clanek/isdoc-narodni-standard-elektronicke-fakturace.aspx">ISDOC/ISDOCX</a> is also acceptable.
