The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-373.png" alt="35-373.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Spain in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-379.jpeg" alt="35-379.jpeg" />	</p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Spain’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall high implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and 9 (Multilingualism). The only area of improvement concerns the Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency), for which the score of 2 shows a lower-medium performance in the implementation of effectiveness and efficiency evaluations on interoperability solutions and technological options (Recommendation 19)  which could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><p><img src="img/35-381.jpeg" alt="35-381.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Spanish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance with a majority of scores of 4. The remaining potential area of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2, are related to legal interoperability. Specifically, the score of 3 for Spain in Recommendation 27, stating that when drafting legislation to establish a European public service, the country should perform a ‘digital check’ and consider data protection requirements, lowers the legal interoperability result for Spain.</p><p><img src="img/35-384.jpeg" alt="35-384.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Spain’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a high performance in the implementation of all recommendations with scores of 4 in all areas. Concretely, Spain performs above the EU average in the areas of catalogues, external information sources and services and security and privacy. However, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to the base registries approach. Precisely, the score of 3 on the availability of authoritative sources of information and the use of control mechanisms to ensure security and privacy in accordance with the relevant legislation (Recommendation 37) and on the development of interfaces with base registries and authoritative sources of information (Recommendation 38) could be improved to reach the maximum score of 4.</p><p>Additional information on Spain’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2020-egovernment-works-people">eGovernment Benchmark Report</a>, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity:</strong> indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services:</strong> indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers:</strong> indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

It is a three-year project with 27 participants fully funded by the Horizon 2020 Programme. </p><p>The objective of the project is to provide real scenarios of online procedures that exchange evidence between countries by means of a technical system, in compliance with Article 28.2 of Law No. 39/2015 and Article 14 of the Single Digital Gateway Regulation, which both refer to the Once-Only principle. Specific attention is devoted to assessing the applicability and benefits of innovative technologies with transformative impact, such as blockchain and machine learning. The pilot covers some of the fully online procedures listed in Annex II of the Single Digital Gateway Regulation, which relate to the life events of studying and moving abroad and doing business abroad. </p><p>For its construction, the project considers as a priority the reuse of elements that already exist both at European and national level and, when necessary, the development of new ones.
