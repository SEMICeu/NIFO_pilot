Since then the United Nations E-Government Survey has gained wide acceptance as a global authoritative measure of how public administrations provide electronic and mobile public services. The United Nations E-Government Survey measures the development of eGovernment using the E-Government Development Index (EGDI), which has the following three components:</p><ul><li><strong>OSI</strong> – Online Service Index</li><li><strong>TII</strong> – Telecommunication Infrastructure Index</li><li><strong>HCI</strong> – Human Capital Index</li></ul><p>According to the United Nations E-Government Survey, Liechtenstein has the following e-government indicators for 2020:</p><ul><li><strong>E-Government Development Index:</strong> 0.8359 (2020)</li></ul><p>[Highest score: Denmark 0.9758]</p><ul><li><strong>Online Service Index:</strong> 0.6588 (2020)</li></ul><p>[Highest score: Estonia – 0.9941]</p><ul><li><strong>Telecommunication Infrastructure Index: </strong>1 (2020)</li></ul><p>[Highest score: Liechtenstein – 1]</p><ul><li><strong>Human Capital Index: 0</strong>.8489<strong> </strong>(2020)</li></ul><p>[Highest score: Iceland – 0.9525]</p><ul><li><strong>E-Participation Index: 0.6071 </strong>(2020)</li></ul><p>[Highest score: Estonia – 1.0000]</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href="https://publicadministration.un.org/egovkb/en-us/Reports/UN-E-Government-Survey-2020">UN E-Government Survey 2020</a></p><h2>Interoperability State of Play </h2><p>In 2017, the European Commission published the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/sites/isa/files/eif_brochure_final.pdf">European Interoperability Framework</a> (EIF) to give specific guidance on how to set up interoperable digital public services through a set of 47 recommendations. The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-176.png" alt="35-176.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Liechtenstein in 2021.</p><p><img src="img/35-193.png" alt="35-193.png" />	</p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Liechtenstein’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall fair performance in the implementation of the EIF Principles, despite the lack of data for Principles 2 (Inclusion and Accessibility), 4 (Reusability), 6 (User-centricity), 9 (Multilingualism) and 10 (Administrative simplification). Liechtenstein gets a high score of 4 on the implementation of Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility), scoring above the EU average. Potential areas for improvements concern the implementation of Principles 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) for which the score of 2 shows a lower-medium performance related to the evaluation by public administrations of the efficiency and effectiveness of interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and the balance between costs and benefits (Recommendation 19).  </p><p><img src="img/35-211.png" alt="35-211.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The results of Liechtenstein in Scoreboard 2 illustrate a good performance with scores 4 in all layers, despite the lack of data for the technical interoperability. Liechtenstein’s areas of improvement concern the better implementation of the recommendations related to the interoperability governance. Particularly, Liechtenstein scores 2 in the consultation of relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level, in accordance with the country’s NIF, when procuring and developing ICT solutions (Recommendation 23). </p><p><img src="img/35-230.png" alt="35-230.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Despite the lack of data for open data, Liechtenstein’s scores analysing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 highlight an overall good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with security and privacy, the internal and external information sources and services, base registries, as well as catalogues. However, areas for improvements concern the implementation of recommendations related to the conceptual model it-self. More specifically, Liechtenstein public administrations scores 1 on their use of the conceptual model to design new services or reengineer existing ones and reuse, whenever possible, existing service and data components (Recommendation 34). Furthermore, in the area of security and privacy, the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services is only partial and could be improved (Recommendation 47).</p><p>Additional information on Liechtenstein’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p><em>This section of the factsheet is meant to present the country’s performance on the main eGovernment indicators according to the latest eGovernment Benchmark report, which monitors the development of eGovernment in Europe. </em></p><p><em>At the present moment, the report does not analyse the state of play of eGovernment in Liechtenstein.</em></p><p><img src="img/35-250.jpeg" alt="A group of people around a table

The government’s main objective has been a continuous optimisation in terms of process efficiency and customer-friendly design for the national administration. This applies to administrative processes as well as to the concerns and needs of the population, companies and other stakeholders. In the course of this legislative period, a series of measures have strengthened the service of the State administration with a strong focus on electronic means of communication. The programme presented decisive opportunities and addresses some primary challenges posed by digitisation. </p><p>The Digital Agenda has been a central field of action for the legislature. There was a general consensus that administration services should be offered electronically and made available around the clock. In this context, there was also awareness that when official business is conducted via electronic means, data security and privacy must be a high priority. </p><p class="subtitle">eGovernment Strategy 2019-2023</p><p>The <a href="https://www.regierung.li/media/attachments/ikr-eGovernmentStrategie-A4-D.PDF?t=636911057929590704">eGovernment Strategy</a> is based on the knowledge gained from the implementation of an earlier strategy dating back a decade. In March 2019, the government presented its overarching considerations for future digitisation and formulated concrete fields of action articulated in objectives and measures. The new revised eGovernment Strategy includes a vision, principles and guidelines for the implementation of digital services as well as defined areas of action. The strategy will be implemented by means of individual projects.</p><p>Although the State administration relies heavily on eGovernment, citizens continue to enjoy non-electronic access to all administrative services. However, eGovernment should facilitate access to administrative services and make business transactions more efficient. The administration thus enables a customer-friendly, personal and competent service, both electronically and non-electronically.<a id="_Toc1474952"></a></p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>Security aspects </h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p class="subtitle">Blockchain Partnership</p><p>On 1 February 2019, the Principality of Liechtenstein signed the declaration on joining the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/liechtenstein-joins-european-blockchain-partnership">European Blockchain Partnership</a>.
