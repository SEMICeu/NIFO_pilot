The NEGS is currently being evaluated. In addition to observing the principles listed in the 2017 <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ministerial-declaration-egovernment-tallinn-declaration">Tallinn Declaration on eGovernment</a>, the NEGS will also be checked against new trends which are increasingly influencing the digital transformation of society, business and industry, at the national, European and international level. Depending on the information gathered by the evaluation, the NEGS will be updated or a newer and more broadly-based digital strategy for public administration in Germany will be developed. The description of the current NEGS given below applies until further notice. The goal of the current Strategy is to guide the country's eGovernment progress in the coming years. The Strategy has been developed in cooperation with a broad spectrum of stakeholders from the fields of administration, politics, science and business.</p><p>The National eGovernment Strategy aims at ensuring a common orientation for eGovernment activities and efforts at federal, state and local levels in order to establish an attractive eGovernment and information technology approach for citizens and businesses. Thereby, according to the new Strategy's vision, eGovernment should be characterised by five principles:</p><ul><li>Orientation on usefulness for citizens, businesses and public administration: Potential users of eGovernment offerings/services like citizens and businesses should be fully aware of the services offered to them and be able to access them. In particular, broadband access in rural areas should be improved as well as citizens' digital/media literacy. </li><li>Cost-effectiveness and efficiency: For enabling the public administration to provide rapid, cost-efficient and high-quality services, it should design process chains within the public administration, which should be supported by electronic means, following a customer-centric approach. The various processes will be digitised to the most possible extent, with the Federal Government and the States putting the appropriate legal, organisational and technical instruments in place for ensuring the mandatory use of digital technologies. </li><li>Data protection, cyber security and transparency: Data protection, security and transparency constitute important preconditions for the citizens to accept, trust and intensively use eGovernment. Therefore, the National eGovernment Strategy aims at ensuring data transparency and security by paying particular attention to only collect and process the data that is absolutely necessary for providing a particular administrative service. The protection of the providing systems is vital for the acceptance of eGovernment services as well.</li><li>Social participation and transparency: Active participation of citizens and businesses in policy as well as in planning and decision-making processes is fostered, as far as it is reasonable and allowed by law. Impact and results of participation should be made transparent to citizens and businesses. Innovation and sustainability: Federal, State and local Public Administrations will support the capacity for innovation and openness to change through their own high-performance and client-oriented eGovernment offerings.</li></ul><p>The National eGovernment Strategy also contains six key principles that new legislations and initiatives should take into account: </p><ul><li>Citizens and businesses can complete as many of their errands as possible from the same point of access, regardless of time and location.</li><li>Authorities should be able to cooperate quickly across different levels to minimize the administrative burden for citizens, businesses and public administration, e.g. by providing spatial data via the Spatial Data Infrastructure Germany initiative (GDI-DE). </li><li>Citizens and businesses should know which public authorities process their personal data. They should be confident that eGovernment is secure.</li><li>Citizens use electronic media to participate actively in the policy process and in organising the provision of public services.</li><li>Public administration should use cooperation models with the business and research community when developing and operating eGovernment solutions. It will enable innovative business models, in particular through online services and information.</li><li>Information security management leads to a high level of IT security for eGovernment procedures and guarantees confidentiality, integrity and availability of data.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Memorandum for the National eGovernment Strategy </p><p>At its 5<sup>th</sup> Meeting of 30 June 2011, the IT Planning Council took the first concrete steps towards the implementation of the National eGovernment Strategy, by publishing a <a href="https://www.it-planungsrat.de/SharedDocs/Pressemitteilungen/DE/2011/Memorandum des IT-Planungsrats.html">memorandum</a>, which outlines the agreed strategic goals. The main focus was placed on building a federal infrastructure and aligning individual measurements. According to the memorandum, IT planning envisages the following priorities to be addressed: </p><ul><li>Transparent government and regulatory actions should be promoted by appropriate measures of information technology and eGovernment. </li><li>Federal and state governments need to adapt to the IT processes and current threats from the Internet. Therefore, minimum uniform standards for communication between government departments should be developed. </li><li>Develop a common eID strategy to enable citizens and businesses to securely transact with the administration over the Internet. In this regard, the notification procedure to the European Commission for the German eID was fully finalised in 2017. As reported by the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), “the German eID fulfils all requirement of eIDAS Level of Assurance high”.</li><li>A federal information management system will bring together faster and more efficiently knowledge management to improve public services. </li><li>Sharing initiatives to federal, state and local governments for cost saving in IT infrastructures are in the making. </li><li>The definition of IT security and IT interoperability standards is one of the main tasks of the IT Planning Board. </li><li>The framework for levels across eGovernment should be further developed. The IT planning supports the coordinated activities of the federal and state laws to further adjust the regulatory framework.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">The IT Consolidation Programme of the German Federal Government</p><p>The German Cabinet decided in summer 2015 to substantially modernise the IT of the German Federal Government.

The network will meet at least twice a year. On 21 May 2019, a national kick-off meeting for the SDG implementation took place at the German <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/home/home_node.html">Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community</a> in Berlin.</p><p>The implementation of the SDG regulation was an integral part of the implementation of the German <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ozg/OZG.pdf">Act for the Improvement of Online Access to Administration Services</a> (<em>Onlinezugangsgesetz</em> - OZG). A major screening process of the SDG regulation is under way to identify the concrete implementation requirements on all administrative levels. The aim of this screening process was set up a detailed requirement catalogue for the project managers of the current digitalisation initiatives (portal network, digitalisation program, service accounts, Federal Information Management - FIM, IT consolidation at federal level, modernisation of registries, among others).

The German law for the promotion of eGovernment came into effect on 1 August 2013. Its aim was to facilitate electronic communication with the administration and to enable federal, state and local authorities to provide simpler, more user-friendly and efficient eGovernment services. The main provisions included:</p><ul><li>Obligation for federal, state and local authorities to open a point of access for the transfer of electronic documents.</li><li>Obligation for federal authorities to open a De-Mail access and to offer an electronic proof of identity via electronic identity (eID) card and electronic residence permit.</li><li>Electronic record keeping.</li><li>Enabling electronic evidence and electronic payment in administrative procedures.</li><li>Obligation to document and analyse processes before implementing information technology systems.</li><li>Provision of machine-readable data (open data).</li><li>Georeferencing of electronic registers.</li><li>The eGovernment Act triggered legislative activities in most of the German federal states.

Article 91c ensured the simplification of IT bodies and decision-making processes, thus increasing their effectiveness and enabling their adaptation to the needs of the fast-evolving technical progress. The German federation now has the exclusive legislative competence for the development of a secure linking-up network to inter-connect Federal and Land IT-networks, which is free of underlying media issues. Furthermore, Article 91d constituted a vital component for the modernisation of the administration as it provides the legal basis for facilitating the federation and the Länder to directly and effectively benchmark their administrations in order to increase their effectiveness, transparency and provision of better public services.</p><p class="subtitle">Law on the combination of information technology networks of federal and state governments</p><p>The envisaged objectives of the German Basic Law are implemented through the <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/it-netzg/BJNR270600009.html">Law on Linking up Federal and Land IT Networks</a> (<em>IT-NetzG</em>), adopted on 10 August 2009, as well as through an Inter-Länder Agreement which came into force on 1 April 2010. According to this agreement, the IT Planning Council was established and tasked with developing the technical requirements for the core network infrastructure to be used. Moreover, the IT Planning Council bears the responsibility to steer cross-disciplined eGovernment, projects involving both federation and the Länder.

The eID card enables the respective persons to use those German e-government services which demand the highest level of reliability.</p><p class="subtitle">eIDAS Implementation Act</p><p>Since 1 July 2016, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG">eIDAS Regulation</a> has been the single legal framework for electronic trust services across the EU.

The core of the eIDAS Implementation Act was the Trust Service Act (VDG). It regulated the nationally required clarifications for the effective implementation of the eIDAS Regulation. On 28 February 2019 the Trust Services Ordinance (VDV) came into force, providing the final specifications of the requirements for trust services and trust service providers, such as accessibility and financial security.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identification Promotion Act</p><p>The <a href="https://germanlawarchive.iuscomp.org/?p=690">Electronic Identification Promotion Act</a> came into force on 15 July 2017. It aimed to promote the use and dissemination of online identification through the German eID card, making it easier and more secure. The identity card with its eID function, i.e. an electronic proof of identity function, was introduced in 2010. This feature enables citizens, government agencies and businesses to reliably identify themselves on the Internet. However, use of the eID function lagged behind the expectations. In order to address this situation, since 15 July 2017 each new identity card is issued with a ready-to-use electronic identification function. With the Electronic Identification Promotion Act, several other additional measures were taken in order to promote the usage of the national eID function. The responsible data protection authorities monitor compliance with data protection.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Signature Act</p><p>The German <a href="https://germanlawarchive.iuscomp.org/?p=690">Electronic Signature Act</a> came into force on 22 May 2001, implementing <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2000:013:0012:0020:EN:PDF">EU Directive 1999/93/EC</a> on a Community framework for electronic signatures and replacing the previous Digital Signature Act that was adopted as part of the Information and Communication Services Act of 1 August 1997. It regulated the necessary secure infrastructure for the use of electronic signatures, which received the same legal status as hand-written signatures.

The Digital Signature Act was amended by Signature Act (1.

The world's first data protection law was passed in the German Land of Hessen in 1970. In 1977, a Federal Data Protection Law followed, which was replaced in 1990, and amended in 1994 and 1997. An additional revision took place in August 2002 to align German legislation with the EU Data Protection Directive (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:31995L0046">95/46/EC</a>). </p><p>On 6 April 2016, the EU agreed to a major reform of its data protection framework by adopting the data protection reform package. It comprised the General Data Protection Regulation (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj">Regulation (EU) 2016/679</a> - GDPR), replacing the Directive 95/46/EC and the Police Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680). The GDPR applied from 25 May 2018 and became directly applicable. The GDPR was designed to harmonise data privacy laws across Europe, to strengthen the protection of the individual’s right to personal data protection to guarantee the free flow of personal data between EU Member States. However, the GDPR permitted Member States to modify several provisions under certain conditions via local legislation (opening clauses). In order to keep the quality of German data protection standards and in using several opening clauses Germany adopted the <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/downloads/EN/gesetztestexte/datenschutzanpassungsumsetzungsgesetz.html">Act to Adapt Data Protection Law</a> to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and to Implement Directive (EU) 2016/680 including a <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_bdsg/">Federal Data Protection Act.</a> The amendments came into force in May 2018.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474967"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle">Commercial Registry</p><p>For the Commercial Registry, the most important legislation is the <a href="https://archive.org/stream/germancommercial00germuoft/germancommercial00germuoft_djvu.txt">German Commercial Code</a>. Part II, Article 8, states that the Commercial Registry is under the control of the courts, and the right to inspect the Registry is open to everyone. Copies of entries could be obtained upon application, and they can be authenticated. Another important regulation is the <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/hdlregvfg/index.html">Commercial Registry Regulation</a>.

The <em>Grundbuchordnung</em> places more emphasis on governing the procedural part, the required processes and formalities. Its articles cover information such as the entries to be made in the Registry, rectifications of the data, the exchange of copies of the Land Registries, public charges, access to basic files and more.

The draft was adopted by the Federal Cabinet on 13 October 2010 and entered into force on 3 May 2011. De-Mail enables the sending of traceable and confidential documents and messages online. Compared to conventional e-mail, the delivery of the De-Mails can be proven. It is not possible to read or manipulate the contents of a De-Mail on its journey across the Internet. De-Mail providers are interoperable and provide the same level of security based on an accreditation process that is specified by the legislator. De-Mail providers have to fulfil high requirements on security, functions, interoperability and data protection. Furthermore, De-Mail legislation foresees that providers must not only furnish the stated certificates for security, functionality and interoperability, but must also demonstrate comprehensive measures to protect personal data within the scope of the accreditation procedure. </p><p>The basic specifications for security, functionality and interoperability were drawn up by the federal government together with future De-Mail providers and laid down in technical guidelines. To ensure compliance with these guidelines, De-Mail providers are screened in an accreditation process. With a focus on data protection, the De-Mail concept, for instance, requires that De-Mail providers can enable the setting up of pseudonym e-mail addresses as a means of preventing traceability in communication or consumer profiles. Furthermore, when requested, De-Mail providers must store the user's encryption certificates in the directory service to support (additional) end-to-end encryption of De-Mails. </p><p>The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) has published the approval criteria on its <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Home/home_node.html">website</a>.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474970"></a>Interoperability </h2><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474971"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p>No legislation was adopted in this field to date.</p><h1><a id="_Toc13235197"></a>Digital Government Governance</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474973"></a>National </h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474974"></a>Policy</h3><p class="subtitle">Minister of State for Digititalisation</p><p>The role of State Minister for Digitalisation at the Federal Chancellery was established in March 2018.</p><table><tr><td><img src="img/36-541.jpeg" alt="36-541.jpeg" /></td><td><p><strong>Dorothee Bär </strong></p><p>Minister of State for Digitalisation</p><p><strong>Contact details:</strong></p><p>Federal Chancellery</p><p>Willy-Brandt-Straße 1</p><p>10557 Berlin</p><p><strong>Source</strong>: <a href="https://www.bundesregierung.de">https://www.bundesregierung.de</a> </p></td></tr></table><p class="subtitle">Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community</p><p>The responsibility for Germany's eGovernment policy lies with the <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/startseite/startseite-node.html">Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community</a>.</p><table><tr><td><p> </p><img src="img/36-542.jpeg" alt="36-542.jpeg" /></td><td><p><strong>Horst Seehofer </strong></p><p>Federal Minister of the Interior, Building and Community</p><p><strong>Contact details:</strong></p><p>Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community</p><p>Alt Moabit 140</p><p>10557 Berlin</p><p><strong>Tel.: </strong>+49 30 18 681-0</p><p><strong>Fax: </strong>+49 30 18 681-12926</p><p><strong>E-mail: </strong>poststelle@bmi.bund.de </p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.bmi.bund.de/">http://www.bmi.bund.de/</a></p></td></tr></table><p class="subtitle">Directorate-General for Digital Society</p><p>Within the <a href="https://www.bmi.bund.de/DE/startseite/startseite-node.html">Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community</a>, the Directorate-General for Digital Society drives the digital transformation and modernisation of public administration in order for it to meet current requirements of performance, responsiveness, efficiency and transparency.</p><table><tr><td><p> </p><img src="img/36-543.jpeg" alt="36-543.jpeg" /></td><td><p><strong>Peter Batt</strong></p><p>Director General for Digital Society, Digitisation in Public Administration and Information Technology </p><p><strong>Contact details:</strong></p><p>Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community </p><p>Alt Moabit 140 </p><p>10557 Berlin</p><p><strong>Tel.:</strong> +49 30 18 681-12723</p><p><strong>Fax:</strong> +49 30 18 681-12983</p><p><strong>E-mail:</strong> <a href="mailto:IT-Beauftragter@bmi.bund.de">IT-Beauftragter@bmi.bund.de</a></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.bmi.bund.de/">http://www.bmi.bund.de/</a></p></td></tr></table><p class="subtitle">Federal Government Commissioner for Information Technology</p><p>The Office of the <a href="https://www.cio.bund.de/Web/DE/Startseite/startseite_node.html">Federal Government Commissioner for Information Technology</a> was established on 1 January 2008, in line with the Federal IT-Steering Strategy's guidelines.

The number of public administrative procedures in Germany that can be completed online has therefore been significantly increased in the near future. These eGovernment services became easier and faster to find on the web - as users no longer need to know which federal jurisdiction is responsible for the respective procedure. </p><p>To achieve this aim, the German federal, state and local governments worked on a <a href="https://www.service.bund.de/Content/DE/Home/homepage_node.html">common digitisation platform</a>. This platform took the shape of a joint network of the administrative portals at the federal and state level. The portals are structured according to life and business situations. Municipal portals and services are connected to the portal network via state portals. To allow for simple and secure processing of eGovernment offers, users are provided with service accounts, similar to customer accounts in online commerce, which also feature post office box functions. In order to save time and costs, the portal network builds on existing solutions. </p><p>In 2018, the German Federal government launched a newly revised portal that provides access to eGovernment services of the federal authorities via a federal service account. This account complied with the requirements of the Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC - in short, eIDAS Regulation. Federal ministries and government agencies using this account thus automatically complied with the EU-requirements that came into force in September 2018. As part of the portal network, the new administrative portal will eventually also offer access to procedures and services within the jurisdiction of the federal states and municipalities. The legal basis for the entire project was the so-called <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/ozg/OZG.pdf">Online Access Act</a> which came into force in August 2017. </p><p>The digitisation initiative is flanked by a digitisation program of the IT-Planning Council, a central body in which federal and state authorities work together on issues of information technology in the public sector. Within this program, selected administrative procedures with high relevance for citizens and companies were digitised. These procedures were made available online nationwide in 2018 via the portal network.</p><p>The digitisation of public administration in Germany was further supported by FIM (Federal Information Management). By offering textual information, form fields and processes, FIM laid the foundation for a uniform and unambiguous description and structuring of public tasks and duties both for the enforcement level and for the legislation. FIM furthermore provided the conditions for a simplified electronic mapping of cross-organisational administrative processes in the form of IT-based procedures. The three building blocks (services, forms and processes) as well as the overall coordination were jointly operated by the German Federal government and the state governments. A <a href="https://www.beta.bund.de/SharedDocs/DE/Meldungen/BuergerInnen/2018-08-15-Live-Gang-Beta-Bund-De.html">Beta Version</a> of the new portal was launched in September 2018.</p><p class="subtitle">GovData Portal</p><p><a href="https://www.govdata.de/">GovData</a>, the data portal for Germany, provides a unified, centralised access to administrative data from federal, state and local governments.

The IVBB provides the main federal authorities with central Internet access and networking services. Until July 2006, IVBB also provided access to the IVBB Intranet, which was replaced by the Federal Intranet (<em>Intranet des Bundes</em>). The new intranet portal features new content, services and workflows, such as person and federal agencies search engine, a travel management system and access to information and document databases.</p><p>The IVBV is a private IP-based communication network, which serves as intranet among the different Public Administration departments.

Compared to conventional e-mail, the delivery of the De-Mails and the identity of sender and receiver can be proven. It is not possible to read or manipulate the contents of a De-Mail on its journey across the Internet. One important aim of De-Mail is to make these basic security functions, regarding confidentiality, reliability and binding, easy to use, without the need for additional installations for the end-user. The sender and recipient of a De-Mail can be clearly identified. Send and delivery certificates can be easily generated.</p><p>De-Mails are encrypted during transport and can neither be intercepted nor manipulated. SPAM and Phishing are effectively prevented because the De-Mail sender can be clearly identified by secure initial identification and users are able to log on with two-factor-authentication using the new German eID card or a mobile phone-based method (mobile TAN). </p><p>Furthermore, De-Mail offers huge potential to optimise electronic communications in the private and public sector. Recently, business and administration processes were marked by media inconsistencies that produced considerable delays and additional costs. With the additional security functions that De-Mail provides, a large part of today's paper-based business and administration processes can now be handled fully electronically, simply, quickly, and from any location. </p><p>Legal requirement for registration as a De-Mail provider is the Act to regulate De-Mail services and amendments to other legislation, which entered into force on 3 May 2011.

The new <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ElectrIDDocuments/eIDcard/eIDcard_node.html">eID card</a> in credit card format replaced the existing national identity card and offered more functions than the current conventional ID. By utilising a microchip, the card provided an online authentication functionality, applicable to both eGovernment and eBusiness transactions. Due to the assignment of authorisation certificates and the mutual authentication, cardholders could be confident that whoever requests their data is also authorised to obtain it. The secure eID card provided further protection against identity theft and offered new, user-friendly ways to guarantee valid client-data for service providers and to protect young people by age verification. Furthermore, the eID card could be used as identification and authentication means for remote signatures. To ensure that national ID cards continued to serve as secure travel documents, eID cards contained biometric identifiers stored on a chip which satisfied requirements for official identity checks. All eID cards included a digital biometric photo; cardholders could choose to include two fingerprints on the chip as well. Both identifiers provided an efficient way to increase security at border controls. </p><p>In February 2017, Germany triggered, as the first Member State, the <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Topics/ElectrIDDocuments/German-eID/eIDAS-notification/eIDAS_notification_node.html">pre-notification procedure</a> to make sure that EU people and businesses could use their trusted electronic identification means (eID), as provided under eIDAS, to digitally authenticate themselves, in order to use online services across the European Union. elD cards shall guarantee an elevated level of security and protection of personal data'.

Beyond traditionally relevant data, a digital facial image of the owner was also stored on the microchip. In June 2007, the revision of the <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/pa_g_1986/index.html">Passport Act</a>, as approved by the Federal Council, laid down the legal foundation for second generation electronic passports. In addition to the digital facial image, the new passports featured two fingerprints in digital format. Fingerprints were to be stored exclusively on the passport’s microchip, and never stored locally on issuance authorities’ systems, or in any other central database.</p><p>In March 2017, Germany issued a new generation of passports.
