Nonetheless, areas of improvements should be concentrated in Principle 2 (Openness), Principle 7 (Inclusion and accessibility) and Principle 12 (Assessment of effectiveness and efficiency) for which the scores of 1 show a low performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, Romania could work towards ensuring a level playing field for open-source software and demonstrate further active and fair consideration of using open-source software (Principle 2 – Recommendation 3) as well as ensuring that its citizens have access to all European public services, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14).</p><p><img src="img/35-678.x-emf" alt="35-678.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Romanian results for the implementation of interoperability layers shows a medium-low performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations, except for the implementation of the organisational interoperability layer, for which the country received the highest score. However, potential areas of improvement could be in the interoperability governance, the integrated public service governance, the legal interoperability as well as in technical interoperability. More specifically, Romania could firstly focus on putting in place processes to select relevant standards and specifications, to evaluate them, as well as to monitor their implementation, check their compliance and test their interoperability (Interoperability governance – Recommendation 21). Additionally, in terms of legal interoperability, Romania should work towards ensuring that its legislation is screen by means of “interoperability checks”, so as to identify any barriers to interoperability (Legal interoperability – Recommendation 27).</p><p><img src="img/35-680.x-emf" alt="35-680.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Romania’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 shows a medium performance with regard to the implementation of recommendations, although it scores at the EU average for the recommendations related to external information sources and services. However, room for improvement is found in relation to the implementation of recommendations associated with internal information sources and services, and catalogues, which received the score of 1. In fact, there is room for improvement with regard to internal information sources and services, where Estonia’s score of 1 is below that of the EU average. More specifically, the country should work towards the development of a shared infrastructure of reusable services and information sources that can be used by all public administrations (Internal information sources and services – Recommendation 36) as well as ensuring it has in place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions and use common models for describing them (Catalogues – Recommendation 44). </p><p>Additional information on Romania’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

Public access points have been set up in each area covered by the networks. The objectives are to reduce the rural-urban digital divide, stimulate the use of ICTs in schools, and facilitate the interaction between citizens and administration. The network has covered 255 rural communities and small towns throughout Romania, targeting over 1.7 million Romanian citizens (10% of Romanian rural areas).</p><p class="subtitle">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations </p><p>Romania uses the Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA) network as the main cross-border infrastructure to communicate digitally among the EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">National System of Interoperability</p><p>The <a href="https://cetatean.gov.ro/">National System of Interoperability (SNI)</a> was launched in November 2021 and will connect the databases of Romania’s public administrations. </p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">Interoperability System with EU Member States</p><p>The ADR is implementing the <a href="https://www.adr.gov.ro/sistem-de-interoperabilitate-tehnologica-cu-statele-membre-ue-situe/">SITUE project</a> (Interoperability System with EU Member States), aimed at fostering the interoperability system across EU Member States.
