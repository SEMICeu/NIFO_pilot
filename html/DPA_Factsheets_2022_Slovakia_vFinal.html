The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><img src="img/35-410.png" alt="35-410.png" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main components (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Slovakia in 2021. </p><img src="img/35-437.x-emf" alt="35-437.x-emf" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Slovakia’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF principles. Slovakia meets the European average for most principles, except for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility), Principle 9 (Multilingualism), and Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). The lower-middle performance on these principles indicates that Slovakian public administrations should ensure that national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies are aligned with the EIF and, if needed, tailor and extend them to address the national context and need (Recommendation 1). Moreover, it could improve their use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Recommendation 16), and foster the way in which they evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits (Recommendation 19).</p><img src="img/35-443.x-emf" alt="35-443.x-emf" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Slovakian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows a very good performance. Slovakia reaches a maximum score of 4, in line with the European average, for all interoperability layers. To maintain this high performance, an area of improvement linked to interoperability governance could be for Slovak public administrations to participate more actively in the standardisation work relevant to the needs of all national public administrations to ensure that their requirements are met (Recommendation 24), and to better perceive data and information as a public asset that should be appropriately generated, collected, managed, shared, protected and preserved (Recommendation 30).</p><img src="img/35-456.x-emf" alt="35-456.x-emf" /><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Slovakia’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an excellent performance in the implementation of all recommendations. A possible area of improvement concerns open source, where the country could enhance the way in which it publishes open data in machine-readable, non-proprietary formats. It could also ensure that open data is accompanied by high quality, machine-readable metadata in non-proprietary formats, including a description of their content, the way data is collected and its level of quality and the licence terms under which it is made available (Recommendation 42). </p><p>Additional information on Slovakia’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play</h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li><strong>User centricity:</strong> indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li><strong>Transparency:</strong> indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li><strong>Cross-border services:</strong> indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li><strong>Key enablers:</strong> indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The age of quantum technologies is approaching – quantum computers, quantum cryptography and quantum sensors as part of the IoT will become the decisive technologies in the new IT age;</li><li>Next-generation fixed and mobile networks will allow Slovakia to get access to high-speed broadband connection, extension of NGA technologies in order to transfer data quickly and seamlessly. Subsequently, it will be necessary to build 5G networks to support autonomous and connected mobility and smart transport systems with expected massive utilisation in the future; and</li><li>Internet of Things (IoT), in particular in the context of education. In fact, various primary and secondary school and university curricula in Slovakia have already been extended with matters concerning IoT, thanks to which Slovak students have excellent results in IoT and robotics. </li></ul><p>In order to carry out effective measures in the mentioned priority areas, it is necessary to strengthen the institutional background that constitutes the basis of the innovation ecosystem. The <a href="https://www.vicepremier.gov.sk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AP-DT-English-Version-FINAL.pdf">2019–2022 Action Plan for Digital Transformation of Slovakia</a> defines the ambition to create and strengthen the current institutional background in order to bring the benefits of novel technologies across all economic and societal sectors. This could be achieved by supporting the set-up of the different areas in order to facilitate its uptake. The possible measures include: </p><ul><li>Support to activities of the Digital Coalition;</li><li>Support to setting up and connecting DIHs in Slovakia;</li><li>Support to setting up and operating a platform for research on and use of Artificial Intelligence;</li><li>Support to setting up and operating a national high-performance computing competence centre; and</li><li>Support to setting up and operating the national competence and coordination centre for cybersecurity.</li></ul><p>Slovakia is currently preparing the 2023-2026 Action Plan for Digital Transformation of Slovakia, as a follow-up to the current Action Plan. It will be built upon the following pillars:</p><ul><li>Support of digital transformation of enterprises and digitalisation of broader economy;</li><li>Support of research and implementation of top digital technologies;</li><li>Build-up of society well adapted to the digital era; and</li><li>Support of the twin transition and sustainable development. </li></ul><p class="subtitle">Permanent Commission for Ethics and for the Regulation of Artificial Intelligence </p><p>As one of the measures of the <a href="https://www.vicepremier.gov.sk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SDT-English-Version-FINAL.pdf">2030 Strategy for the Digital Transformation of Slovakia</a>, the <a href="https://www.mirri.gov.sk/sekcie/informatizacia/digitalne-inovacie/stala-komisia-pre-etiku-a-regulaciu-umelej-inteligencie/index.html">Permanent Commission for Ethics and for the Regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> was set up in November 2020. The Permanent Commission for Ethics and for the Regulation of AI is an independent advisory body made of experts from various fields, who act in their own capacity. Its main goals are to assess ethical and regulatory framework issues arising from the development, deployment and use of AI technologies, as well as preparing opinions on legislation in the field of the ethical aspects of AI. The Commission may also comment on draft laws at national level or legislative acts at international level. </p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p class="subtitle">Participation in the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure</p><p>Slovakia has been a member of the European Blockchain Partnership since 2018 and part of the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure since 2020. Under the umbrella of the Recovery and Resilience Plan, Slovakia will invest into extending EBSI nodes within its borders. Slovakia will deploy a network of distributed blockchain nodes and fully participate in EBSI pilot projects. Slovakia aims to use EBSI infrastructure also in national eGovernment projects. </p><h3>Big data</h3><p class="subtitle">Involvement in the European Digital Innovation Hubs</p><p>The Slovak Recovery and Resilience Plan supports the overall takeover of cloud, big data and AI technologies by small and medium enterprises. This goal will be attained by building a network of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH) and Digital Innovation Hubs (DIH) across Slovakia. The network will be spread regionally in order to ensure equal and easy access to services, and they will have a double function: first, they will map the stage of digital maturity of companies in the given region; and second, they will prepare and provide individual digital or technical solutions tailored to their clients. They will use solutions mostly based on new technologies, including cloud, big data and AI, plus other technologies and digital instruments mentioned in the Digital Europe programme. </p><p>All entities will provide tailor-made services to their clients - mostly SMEs, but they may also include public authorities and large companies. In Slovakia, one of the major barriers to adopting new technologies by businesses is a low capitalisation of SMEs specifically; therefore, the services offered by EDIHs/DIHs will be provided for free or for a price lower than the market price. The Hubs will be involved in the wider European network, which is being built with the financial support of the Digital Europe Programme. There will be 5 such hubs put into operation by the end of the 3rd quarter of 2022, as defined in the RRP.</p><h3>Cloud computing</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance computing </h3><p>Involvement in Quantum Research and High-Performance Computing</p><p>Slovakia contributes to quantum research and high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. The goals are under the umbrella of the RRP. Slovakia is a member of EuroHPC, which has already started to launch dedicated calls for the development and deployment of supercomputers that will be integrated into high-performance computing infrastructure. Slovakia is preparing investment into the top European supercomputer with very high energy efficiency.</p><p>Moreover, as part of the RRP investments, Slovakia will create a quantum communication network of 3 links with 12 nodes between research and development centres across the country. The first 6 nodes will be put into operation before the end of 2023. Building on that, the infrastructure will be made available for industrial and public-sector users. Slovakia is also involved in the cross-border European project Quapital and, in October 2020, it established the first functional link between two capitals in the world: Bratislava and Vienna. The next phase of creating a quantum communication ecosystem will consist of extending the links to bordering countries and beyond. The quantum communication infrastructure consists of the following elements:</p><ul><li>Link Vienna - Bratislava Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAV) - Slovak University of Technology Bratislava (STU) - Trnava - Trenčín - Žilina - Liptovský Mikuláš - Prešov - Košice (prospectively expected to continue to the Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine);</li><li>Link Bratislava - Nitra - Zvolen - Banská Bystrica; and</li><li>Link Bratislava - Komárno (prospectively continued to Hungary).</li></ul><p>The Slovak RRP will co-finance the building of the QCI terrestrial network and the development of single quantum photon detectors. Besides that, international connections are planned with neighbour countries and satellite component in the future.</p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle">National Broadband Plan </p><p>In the course of 2020, experts prepared the <a href="https://www.mirri.gov.sk/aktuality/digitalna-agenda/vicepremierka-remisova-predstavila-narodny-plan-pristup-k-ultra-rychlemu-internetu-maju-mat-do-roku-2030-vsetky-domacnosti/index.html">National Broadband Plan</a>, which was approved by the government of the Slovak Republic on 17 March 2021. The vision of Slovakia is to ensure access to a telecommunication infrastructure that will be able to fulfil the quality and capacity requirements of networks in terms of the Gigabit Society for all citizens, entrepreneurs and public administration. The fulfilment of this vision will be achieved by the following goals by 2030:</p><p>1. All households, whether rural or urban, shall have access to the Internet at a speed of at least 100 Mbit/s with the possibility of expansion to gigabit speed; and </p><p>2. All-important entities of socio-economic interaction, such as schools, transport hubs, major public service providers, as well as enterprises using digital services, will have access to gigabit connectivity, on the passive part of the infrastructure that will not require replacement in the future due to increasing capacity or other quality and technology requirements.</p><p>The national plan will continue with the pre-preparation phase (for a feasibility study and mapping of broadband to addresses).</p><p class="subtitle">Memorandum of Cooperation on ‘White Spots’ Coverage </p><p>In 2018, a Memorandum of Cooperation on ‘white spots’ coverage was signed between the Slovak government and 29 operators, which are committed to grant coverage of at least 50% of the territory of the municipalities on the list with NGA technology at speeds of 30 Mbps by the end of 2020. In May 2021, Slovakia finalised the evaluation of this joint initiative, which ensured the coverage of 1 772 municipalities (98% of the original 1 808 municipalities) by at least one operator. This was achieved directly by stimulating operators' own business plans, without any intervention from the state, and the efforts continued despite the COVID-19 pandemic. At present, 21 municipalities from the original Memorandum of Cooperation remain uncovered (i. e. the coverage did not surpass 50% of their territory). However, a significant number of covered municipalities still only have a little over half of their territory covered.</p><img src="img/35-679.jpeg" alt="35-679.jpeg" /><p>	 Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><p>4</p><h1><a id="_Toc104542079"></a>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474962"></a>Specific legislation on digital public administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Information Technologies in the Public Sector Act No. 95/2019 </p><p>The <a href="https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2019/95/20210101.html">Information Technologies in the Public Sector Act  No. 95/2019</a> (ITPS) was published in March 2019.
