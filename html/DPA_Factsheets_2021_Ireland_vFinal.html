The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-298.png" alt="35-298.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Ireland in 2020. </p><p><img src="img/35-319.jpeg" alt="35-319.jpeg" />	</p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Ireland’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality). Areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 4 (Reusability), 5 (Technological neutrality and data portability) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) for which the scores of 3 and 1 show respectively an upper-medium and a lower performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. More specifically, by working on Recommendation 19, which concerns the evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits, the overall score for Principle 12 would be improved.</p><p><img src="img/35-328.jpeg" alt="35-328.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Irish results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows a mixed performance with scores of 1, 3 and 4. Key areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are in legal interoperability and interoperability governance, where Ireland has scores of 1 for both. More specifically, the score of 1 for Ireland in Recommendation 27, which states that legislation should be screened by means of ‘interoperability checks’, to identify any barriers to interoperability, could be improved in order to enhance the low legal interoperability result. Additionally, Ireland scored below the EU average in the area of organisational interoperability with a score of 3. By improving the score of 1 in Recommendation 28, which states that business processes should be documented using commonly accepted modelling techniques, the overall score of 3 could be brought closer to the EU average. </p><p><img src="img/35-340.jpeg" alt="35-340.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Ireland’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a poor performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with internal information sources and services, and the conceptual model itself, each with a score of 1 which is significantly below the EU average of 4. Additionally, improvements could be made in implementing recommendations related to base registries, where the score of 3 is also below the EU average. More specifically, the lack or poor standard of data quality assurance plans for base registries and related master data (Base Registries – Recommendation 40) hinders the overall Irish score.</p><p>Additional information on Ireland’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

The act comes in the wake of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Data Protection Act 2018 with the aim to clarify and strengthen the data-sharing rights and obligations of public bodies. The act paves the way for more efficient and cost-effective service delivery by public bodies by providing a clear legal basis for the sharing of personal data in certain circumstances. The aim is to reduce the administrative burden associated with the need for individuals to provide their personal data to numerous public bodies. The act allows for the sharing of personal data between public bodies where the sharing is for the performance of a function of either of the public bodies. In addition, the act provides for the establishment of a Personal Data Access Portal that would allow individuals to view their personal data as well as information in relation to any data breaches affecting their personal data and the data-sharing agreements under which their personal data is processed. Besides, the act allows the Minister to designate base registries for use by public bodies so that they can access personal data without having to collect it directly from service users. A base registry will have an owner who must ensure the personal data is accurate and up to date.</p><h2>Key enablers </h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474964"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">Freedom of Information Act </p><p>A new <a href="http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2014/en/act/pub/0030/index.html">Freedom of Information (FOI) Act</a> came into force on 14 October 2014.

GN offers a number of potential cost and operational benefits: inter-agency collaboration and delivery of joined-up government services; access for all agencies to network capability and products/technology (regardless of size); execution of a number of standard day-to-day infrastructure services allowing agencies to focus on their core programmes and services; improvement of security for government information systems; internet access for agencies; and commercial advantages of an aggregated procurement approach, resulting in reduced costs and high quality services. </p><p>In 2018, through a coordinated and innovative nationwide approach to the delivery of connectivity, economies of scale have been achieved with standardised services to agencies in cities, towns and more remote locations where previously only limited services existed.

In 2019, the OGP, through the eInvoicing Ireland Programme and in collaboration with public sector partners, established a National Framework for the Procurement of eInvoicing Systems and Services by Public Bodies. The Framework offers compliant eInvoicing services and solutions for shared services and coordinating facilities as well as individual public bodies, to receive and process eInvoices in accordance with the European Standard and the national approach for the implementation of the directive. The services and solutions range from online portals that facilitate basic compliance to more integrated straight-through-processing options.</p><p>Since 18 April 2019, central government contracting authorities and entities are required to receive and process eInvoices that comply with the European Standard on eInvoicing in public procurement. Since 18 April 2020, all contracting authorities and entities are required to receive and process eInvoices that comply with the European Standard on eInvoicing in public procurement.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.  <a id="_Toc1474996"></a></p><h2>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle">Build to Share Applications</p><p>Build to Share Applications are built and maintained by the <a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/organisation-information/6ee40f-office-of-the-government-chief-information-officer-ogcio/">OGCIO</a>, which delivers a suite of corporate support applications common across Departments.
