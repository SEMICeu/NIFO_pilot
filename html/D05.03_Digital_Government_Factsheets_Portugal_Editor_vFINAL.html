The 2018 edition of the SIMPLEX+ Programme includes 175 additional measures for facilitating the State’s interaction with both citizens and businesses. These measures were devised in collaboration with public servants, citizens and business, continuing and further deepening the co-creative facet of the SIMPLEX+ initiative. </p><p>The monitoring of these measures is carried out through an electronic platform transverse to all areas of governance and accessible by the focal points of the SIMPLEX Network, which is composed by one representative from each ministry whose role is to identify the necessary tasks for the implementation of the different measures and to constantly promote and update its execution rate (all this info is synthesised in standardised periodic implementation reports). </p><p>According to an <a href="https://www.portugal.gov.pt/download-ficheiros/ficheiro.aspx?v=801d3f4d-636e-4966-b81b-332421518970">external evaluation</a> published in 2017, 13 measures of the SIMPLEX+ 2016 represented, alone, "savings of over EUR 620 million" and "had an impact on the economy of over EUR 1 thousand millions". The same assessment referred that it freed the workforce by more than 300 civil servants, allowing their allocation to higher-value, more customer-centric services.</p><p>Examples of SIMPLEX+ 2018 Measures include:</p><ul><li>WHICH SCHOOL: Improve the information available about the network of public schools, by creating geo-referenced information related to the area of ​​influence of public schools;</li><li>PAPERLESS INVOICE: Eliminate the printing of invoices, starting to use only electronic proof;</li><li>BUSINESS MATCH MAKING: Create a platform that will allow Portuguese companies to expose their products online to international markets, in a more intuitive way and with a more efficient search engine. It will also allow Portuguese exporting companies to share experiences and create new export opportunities;</li><li>PARENTALITY + SIMPLE: Implement an online service to facilitate, streamline and enhance the interaction between the Citizen and Social Security, in an automated perspective, significantly improving the quality of services and optimizing the response times associated with the processes of assignment and maintenance of benefits in the scope of parenting;</li><li>+ SIMPLE R&amp;D CONTRACTING: Create a legal framework to simplify and streamline procurement for R&amp;D activities;</li><li>My Appointments.gov: Provide a centralised online scheduling of public services, accessible through the ePortugal webportal.</li></ul><p>In 2019, SIMPLEX+ will evolve to iSIMPLEX, focusing on innovative measures of a more technological and impactful nature in behavioral economics, enabling citizens and businesses to interact “only once” with the State, share and reuse resources and benefit from emerging technologies such as Artificial intelligence. </p><p class="subtitle">Portugal INCoDe.2030</p><p><a href="http://www.incode2030.gov.pt/en/home">Portugal INCoDe.2030</a>, launched in April 2017, is an inter-ministerial action that brings together the areas of Administrative Modernisation, Science, Technology and Higher Education, Education, Labour, Planning and Infrastructures and Economy, and aims to strengthen the basic skills of the Portuguese population in ICT, preparing it for emerging and digitally-based employment opportunities.</p><p>This initiative is structured around five main axes: Inclusion, Education, Qualification, Specialisation and Research. It aggregates a variety of measures to be implemented by different governmental bodies in collaboration with the private sector, academia and civil society. Examples of ongoing activities include a training program for Chief Data Officers; the signing of cooperation protocols between public entities to qualify the specialised human resources of each institution; launching a EUR 3.5 million project competition to support the development of partnerships between Public Administration and R&amp;D institutions in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science; and the development of the Portuguese Strategies for Artificial Intelligence (AI Portugal 2030) and for Advanced Computing (Advanced Computing Portugal 2030).</p><p class="subtitle">LabX </p><p>The <a href="https://labx.gov.pt/">Experimentation Laboratory of the Public Administration</a> (LabX) was created in 2017 as an organic unit of AMA to design and test, along with all the interested parties involved, new services and administrative procedures, more adequate to the needs of citizens, businesses and public services. It envisaged the development of a culture of experimentation in the Portuguese Public Administration to anticipate, accelerate and generate innovation so that the public administration does more and better.</p><p>With a multidisciplinary team that combines service designers, public servants and social scientists, LabX co-created solutions with citizens, public officials and policy makers, to engage these stakeholders and harness their specific insights and contributions. Accordingly, the LabX methodology for conception and development of efficient and user-centric public services has been guided by the following service design principles:</p><ul><li>Research: When LabX gets to know the services’ users, their service experience, their profiles and needs, as well as the organisation providing those services. It’s the moment to map journeys and processes, identify technical, procedural, organisational and legal constraints and to define intervention priorities, therefore defining the right problem;</li><li>Design: Along with specialists and different stakeholders, it’s the time to ideate solutions meant to improve user’s relationships with public services and enhance their efficiency, focusing on their needs;</li><li>Experiment: This stage encompasses the testing of new solutions for public services using an agile and iterative process, in a controlled environment. This includes the prototype of one or more solutions that were conceived in the previous design phase, with the objective of validating their efficiency, as well as to run iterative tests, improving solutions based on development experience and user feedback.</li></ul><p>LabX projects include, for example, the Public Expenditure Roadmap (to simplify and eliminate redundant tasks to improve the control and the quality of public spending);  the Death and Bereavement Desk (to facilitate all bureaucracies with which relatives interact after the death of a family member); the Employment One-Stop-Shop Online /IEFP Online (devised by the Ministry of Labour, Solidarity and Social Security to concentrate in a single digital platform all interactions between public services, unemployed citizens and potential employers); and Fiscal Citizenship 2.0 (developed jointly with the Tax and Customs Authority to improve that entity’s communication with its different end-users, by sharing fiscal information in a more simplified and concise manner). </p><p>LabX paved the way for Portugal’s participation, since November 2017, in the <a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/states-change-building-next-generation-public-innovation">States of Change</a> group, a group of countries that stand out as ‘international champions’ of innovation in the public sector.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474952"></a>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p class="subtitle">National Action Plan for Open Administration.</p><p>Portugal published, in December 2018, its first <a href="https://ogp.eportugal.gov.pt/documents/48760/55198/I_National_Action_Plan_Open_Administration_Portugal_EN+(DEC18).pdf/20545478-eb59-7b0e-90bf-c3b99267d4ff">National Action Plan for Open Administration</a>, which was developed by the National Network for Open Administration through a process of co-creation that involved the public sector and civil society, including an online public consultation held between 19 November 2018, and 3 December 2018.</p><p>This plan included eight commitments to promote transparency and access to public sector information, foster public participation and boost the use of public open data.

One example is the use of data analytics or artificial intelligence as an automatic means for the handling of data (some non-personal and available via the internet of things) in order to prevent problems and/or anticipate needs. Processing all information given in this way allows, for example, to provide citizens with improved services using fully automatic customer care systems in natural language or in disease prevention. Another possibility is the use of augmented reality in the physical design of new services, e.g. by using the citizen service area prototyping. It is also possible to use some technologies, like blockchain, to ensure information and personal data protection and integrity.

Likewise, the portal was developed with a focus on accessibility and usability, adapting to any type of device and presenting a simpler and clearer language.</p><p>It also facilitates the interaction between citizens/companies and the State, providing innovative support mechanisms such as the chatbot SIGMA or the possibility of taking digital queue tickets for onsite public services through the Citizen Map.</p><p>The Citizen Map, which provides geo-location and information for all Portuguese public services, is another relevant feature, available at <a href="https://mapa.eportugal.gov.pt/#/index">mapa.eportugal.gov.pt</a> (a standalone app will soon be launched).</p><p class="subtitle">Open Data Portal (Dados.gov)</p><p>Following international practices in the area (e.g. the US or the UK Data.Gov projects), the Administrative Modernisation Agency is committed to the development of a wide and open platform containing all kinds of data from public bodies. The <a href="https://dados.gov.pt/en/">Dados.gov Portal</a> makes available to citizens an extensive range of information from very diverse areas.</p><p>The objective of this policy - keeping in mind the right of any citizen to consult public administration information - is to democratise that access by facilitating the means to obtain it.</p><p>Dados.gov web-portal was relaunched in May 2018 as Dados.gov+, replacing its previous 2012 version. Developed under the SIMPLEX+ Programme, this new version was designed to conform to the best international practices in the field, and incorporate innovative solutions in terms of user experience, content structure, data integration and user licenses. </p><p>Managed by AMA and available in open source, dados.gov was based on the French UDATA platform, which was developed by ETALAB, and already has more than 2030 datasets. It’s free and open to all users that want to access data, but also to citizens and organisations that wish to make data of public interest available. All they need to do is register, receive their API key, and characterise the dataset to upload. Each dataset can have more than one associated resource and can be published in different and multiple formats, which is one of the features enabling data reuse. It’s also possible to index datasets, by introducing an URL referring to the origin of the data, which is ideal for entities that already have the information available in their own platforms, like the partilha.justiça.gov.pt, from the Justice Ministry, or the Lisboa Aberta portal, from the Lisbon city hall. In case the supplying entity already possesses its own data portal, the publishing process can also be made through data harvest, thus collecting the data in a regular and automated way.</p><p class="subtitle">OGP Portugal</p><p>The <a href="https://ogp.eportugal.gov.pt/en/inicio">OGP Portugal</a> website was developed as part of the Portuguese participation in the Open Government Partnership, to centralize all information about the process and to foster public participation, collecting contributions from citizens and ensuring their feedback. This portal has been available since October 2018, and it is also highlighted in the "Transparency" area of the <a href="https://eportugal.gov.pt/en/inicio">ePortugal portal</a>, with the objective of promoting its dissemination and visibility.</p><p class="subtitle">Tax and Customs Authority Portal (portaldasfinancas.gov)</p><p>The Ministry of Finance makes available to citizens and companies a <a href="https://www.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/pt/home.action">web portal</a> allowing for tax submission and fiscal situation consultation, among a wide range of digital services.

The platform congregates in a single website information about the judicial services in a clearer and more accessible language (all contents are written in ‘plain Portuguese’ and can be easily searched by using a simple interface). The platform represents a watershed moment in how the citizen and companies, and their agents, interact with the various services in the justice sector. </p><p class="subtitle">Closer Justice (<em>Justiça + Próxima</em>)</p><p>This<a href="https://justicamaisproxima.mj.pt/"> portal</a> fosters citizens’ participation regarding ideas, initiatives and projects to improve justice in Portugal. It intends to be a participatory tool, also giving access to various information in the area of Justice.</p><p>The Closer Justice programme hopes to increase transparency and trust in the justice institutions acting through four fundamental pillars: (i) enhancing efficiency and strengthening justice sector management through simplification and dematerialisation of procedures and the use of interoperable technologies; (ii) innovation, by modernising justice; (iii) proximity, pursuing the approach to citizens, by offering clear, transparent and accountable information; and (iv) humanisation, by valuing tangible and intangible resources.</p><p>In this context, technology stands out as a pivotal tool for engaging stakeholders and promoting a ‘digital by default’ principle for courts and other justice stakeholders, with a comprehensive digitalisation and modernisation package consisting of more than 175 measures (new measures are continuously added to the plan) and a total budget of EUR 42 million.</p><p class="subtitle">CITIUS </p><p>The <a href="https://citius.tribunaisnet.mj.pt/habilus/myhabilus/login.aspx">CITIUS</a> service enables electronic submission of documents for use in court cases. Lawyers can present evidence and documents to the courts, check their distribution, look up cases and keep track of fees electronically. For civil cases and injunctions, most correspondence can be conducted electronically. Sets of copies and duplicates are no longer needed. The system is secure in that the use of personal, non-transferable electronic certificates is required.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Yellow Book</p><p>The <a href="https://www.livroamarelo.gov.pt/home">Electronic Yellow Book</a>, launched as a Simplex+ initiative, allows everyone to leave a complaint, a suggestion, or write a compliment, regarding the public administration and its services, namely the digital ones.</p><p class="subtitle">Portal REA</p><p>Launched in December 2016, the <a href="https://rea.apambiente.pt/">State of the Environment portal</a> (portal REA) contains online information about environmental indicators. Developed and managed by the Portuguese Environment Agency, this platform includes information and analysis for a wide range of end-users and is expected to serve as a reference for consultation on key indicators and environmental trends in Portugal.

This platform, which resulted from a SIMPLEX+ project, offers information and online services to seafarers, ship-owners, companies and other users on maritime-related licenses, registrations, applications and statements requests, professional diving, maritime courses and other National Maritime Authority (NMA) services, including services cost simulation and electronic payment. It constitutes a one-stop shop for NMA services, and allows automatic data sharing with other governmental entities. The application is also accessible through Automatic Terminals located at the 28 National Captaincies, located all over the Portuguese coastline and at the fishing auction houses. Additionally, an app is available for maritime police to conduct surveillance operations, allowing access to the application registered data on seafarers, divers, boats, etc. </p><p class="subtitle">National Defence Memory Institutions</p><p>In January 2019, the <a href="https://portalmemoria.defesa.gov.pt/">National Defence Memory Institutions website</a> (NDMI-w) became available. The NDMI-w resulted from a SIMPLEX+ project and provides centralised online access and a specialised search function for the main defence-related National Archives (6), Museums (10) and Libraries (23), located throughout the Portuguese territory. To date, the platform holds more than 630 000 entries, and documentation and cultural artefacts registry and digital scanning, both in 2D and 3D, is ongoing at all ‘memory institutions’. The aim of this platform is to:</p><p>Provide access to virtually all collections of the national defence-related historical and cultural heritage, through proper metadata identification and digital registration;</p><p>Reinforce conservation mechanisms by leveraging the digitisation process of historical documentation and cultural artefacts;</p><p>Provide scale at National Defence level and to be a reference within Public Administration;</p><p>Creation of the National Defence Memory Institutions Network and beyond, as a means of share-to-gain.</p><p class="subtitle">Entrepreneur’s Desk </p><p>The <a href="https://eportugal.gov.pt/inicio/espaco-empresa">Entrepreneur’s Desk</a>, which is within the ePortugal Portal, is the Point of Single Contact to access digital services related to the exercise of economic activity. Services provided include the complete setting up of a business through the web site (<a href="https://eportugal.gov.pt/inicio/espaco-empresa">'Online Business'</a>), as well as the Business Electronic Dossier, where the different interactions of each business with the public administrations are gathered. These are easily and securely available to business partners or their representatives through identity authentication by advanced eSignature certificates. This procedure ensures full transparency on the status of the respective processes. The Entrepreneur’s Desk also brings together information of interest for business activities related to the management, expansion and closure of enterprises, and provides information on opportunities for businesses. This platform registered 87 471 applications in 2018 (+6.2% vs 2017) and made available, by the end of the year, a total of 275 transactional services (+116.5%), 148 of which corresponded to new services added in 2018. In addition to this digital platform, there is also a national network of physical desks, the Business Spots and the Business Support Centres, which provide both face-to-face and digitally assisted services.</p><p class="subtitle">Simplified Business Information (IES)</p><p><a href="http://www.ies.gov.pt/site_IES/site/home.htm">IES</a> is the delivery of declarative obligations related to accounting, taxation and statistics via electronic means and in a completely dematerialised form. All information which businesses have to provide concerning their annual accounts is transmitted collectively and to a single entity. The IES submission has to be made through the Business portal, by choosing IES and filling in the form directly or by opening and sending the corresponding file previously formatted according to specifications laid down by law. It is then submitted electronically to the IES, and the automatically-generated ATM reference has to be retained to allow the payment of the accountability submission registration.

To do so, it aims to minimise the digital barriers in content, software and hardware interfaces offered by the central government on the Internet.</p><p class="subtitle"><em>És Cultura</em> 18</p><p>This <a href="https://escultura.opp.gov.pt/">portal</a> was created within the operationalisation of the project Culture for All, which won, at the national level, the first Edition of the Portugal Participatory Budget. The project promoted free access to cultural events to young people aged 18, and was launched on 16 April 2018, at the National Museum of Ancient Art. It currently provides around 400 cultural offerings involving heritage, performing arts, visual arts, books and cinema, among other areas, in more than 70 public and private entities. Within the scope of state agencies and until March 2019, more than 3 300 young people adhered to this measure, which will continue beyond 2019. </p><p class="subtitle">LIVRAR</p><p>This initiative was also created within the operationalisation of the project Culture for All, the project winner at national level of the first Edition of the Portugal Participatory Budget. It was launched on 13 December 2018, in the National Library of Portugal, with its main objective the donation of books to libraries and the sharing of books among its users. <a href="https://livrar.pt/">LIVRAR</a> is the movement that is created when a book travels from one point to another, sharing a little of each person that donates a book. By May 2019, it registered 1,363 private users, 31 libraries/entities, 661 registered books and 1 216 book requests. The platform will continue to operate after the end of the project that gave rise to it.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474990"></a>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle">Citizen Shops</p><p>The <a href="https://www.ama.gov.pt/web/english/citizen-shop">Citizen Shop</a> is a concept of delivery of public services that combines in the same physical space several public and private entities. It does so with the aim of expediting relations between citizens and companies with the Public Administration.</p><p>The establishment of the first Citizen Shops took place in 1999 in Lisbon and Oporto. Their opening embodied the first step in the direction of the concept of one-stop-shop for public services delivery, since citizens now have access to a wide range of public and private services in the same place. </p><p>This model has been continuously developed to respond to the evolving needs of citizens and companies. Examples include the availability of free Wi-Fi and the possibility to automatically assess, through QR Code or free SMS, the services provided in the Shops. </p><p>The network of Citizen Shops currently comprises 54 one-stop-shops, and 4 more are planned to open until the end of 2019.</p><p class="subtitle">Citizen Spots </p><p>The <a href="https://www.ama.gov.pt/web/english/citizen-spot">Citizen Spot</a> is a multiservice physical counter where a specialised mediator assists citizens in accessing a portfolio of digital public services and further teaches them how to perform it autonomously thereafter.</p><p>The services provided are essentially those already available on various websites, but for citizens who may not feel capable or comfortable to use them by themselves. They included civil registration documents, forms to request the European Health Insurance Card, the Tax Authority’s land registry, social security and tax services, and so on. In 2017, this catalogue was enriched with 22 electronic services.</p><p>All Spots are equipped with a double-screen system (one screen for the mediator and one for the citizen) that allows citizens to follow the steps being taken by the mediator. The service is provided in a completely transparent way, allowing the citizen to learn and control all the steps and procedures being done by the assistant and hence reducing to virtually zero the chances for abuse of power/corruption. </p><p>Moreover, all the operations are supported by electronic identification tools developed by AMA, namely the PIN-protected Citizen Card and the Digital Mobile Key, the Portuguese mobile eID solution which allows citizens to authenticate themselves via mobile phone and email (including foreigners with a registered passport number), thus strengthening the citizen’s trust in digital services and helping them realise the emphasis put on rights to privacy, data and consumer protection.</p><p>The combination of public digital services with the onsite assistance of a specialised mediator, in a brand-new hybrid model of service delivery, has proven to be an effective way to engage citizens in the use of digital services. It makes everyone more aware of the available services and their respective benefits and also aware of online security, which is fundamental to boost public confidence in the use of ICTs in general. </p><p>The project began in 2014 with 125 Spots, 127 services available and 98 899 attendances. In June 2019, there were 587 Spots located in town halls, parishes or post offices throughout the country (aiming to be near all kind of populations) and also in the cities of São Paulo (Brazil), Paris (France) and Brussels (Belgium), providing more than 230 services and more than 1 million attendances in 2018 only. </p><p>The Citizen Spot concept was recently extended with the launching of the Solidarity Citizen Spot, which specifically targets day-care centres, nursing homes and residential structures for the elderly and comprises the operation of mobile kits by a trained mediator, and also the Mobile Citizen Spots, which contemplates the use of minivans to provide digital assisted assistance in remote locations or in catastrophic situations (this project was first mobilised to the localities affected by the fires that occurred in Portugal in the summer of 2017).</p><p class="subtitle">Council for Information and Communication Technologies in Public Administration </p><p>CTIC, the Council for Information and Communication Technologies in Public Administration, is the coordination structure responsible for operationalising the strategy and global action plan for ICT in the Public Administration. It is intended to effectively articulate with the SIMPLEX Programme to recover measures that take advantage of the transformative potential of ICTs and to implement new measures that will improve the quality of citizens’ lives and reduce the costs for companies. CTIC brings a new governance model for ICT in the Public Administration, one that is open to society and well-adjusted to the government's objectives, thereby enabling the effective development of a global ICT strategy.</p><p class="subtitle">Justiça.gov network</p><p>The websites of Justice Department agencies and entities have been updated, with a common network that enables better sharing and availability of content, news, statistics and documents.

The iAP comprises four independent services: 'Integration Platform' provides a simple and integrated delivery of cross-cutting electronic services, becoming a cornerstone in the administrative modernisation process; 'Authentication Supplier' allows authentication using the Citizen Card in portals duly accredited and authorised for that purpose; 'Payments Platform' permits the availability and integrated management of multiple payment methods for different channels; 'SMS Gateway' enables the sending and receiving of SMSs via short numbers between citizens and public administration bodies, thus enlarging the number of available contact channels for managing the relationship with citizens.</p><p>This shared tool for interconnection between different systems enables the provision of digital public services like dematerialised Medical ePrescriptions (mandatory and fully electronic since 2016), the Energy Social Fare, that automatically processes social benefits regarding the energy bill by integrating data from Social Security, the Tax Authority and private energy operators, and Automatic Tax Declarations, which provides citizens with an income declaration pre-filled by the Tax Authority based on the data (income and expenses) it gathers from third parties (employers, businesses, banks, insurance companies, etc.) and from the personal elements declared by the taxpayer in the previous year.</p><p>The Interoperability Platform of the Public Administration has been progressively extended to the private sector, enabling the provision of services such as the Dematerialised Bank Account Opening, available since July 2018 and allowing banks and financial companies to obtain, in a totally dematerialised way, data on the professional situation of potential clients. This service is already fully operational with 5 private entities, and several other entities are currently testing it.</p><p class="subtitle">Portugal INCoDe.2030</p><p>The <a href="http://www.incode2030.gov.pt/en/home">Portugal INCoDe.2030</a>, launched in April 2017, is an inter-ministerial action that brings together the areas of Administrative Modernisation, Science, Technology and Higher Education, Education, Labour, Planning and Infrastructures and Economy, and aims to strengthen the basic skills of the Portuguese population in ICT, preparing them for the emerging digital-based employment opportunities.</p><p>This initiative comprises five axes: Inclusion, Education, Qualification, Specialisation and Research.</p><p class="subtitle">Solidarity Network</p><p>The Solidarity Network consists of around 280 Internet access points belonging to NGOs of and for people with disabilities, the elderly or those at risk of exclusion. Today it is an information aggregator portal for NGOs and the referred target groups.</p><p class="subtitle">Traffic Exchange Point</p><p>The Resolution of the Council of Ministers no 12/2012, of February 7, approved the Global Plan for Rationalisation and Cost Reduction concerning ICT in the Public Administration, establishing a set of ground rules to rationalise the ICT assets used by the Portuguese Government. </p><p>Concerning consolidated ICT solutions (as considered by Decree-Law no 151/2015, of August 6) it was decided to build an infrastructure that supports the communications (voice and data) between the public entities, in a private, secure environment and without the service-fee charged by commercial providers, i.e., a Traffic Exchange Point (PTT) that guarantees direct access between all public entities while promoting a better service and secure, faster and easier access, with lower costs.</p><p>The implementation of the PTT is still progressing to the designated goal of covering all the public sector: the backbone link between the ICT entities of each one of the ministries was achieved in early 2019, with more than 25 different services made available for common use. </p><p>The rollout process will continue for the next years with the implementation of an increasing number of new services in the PTT. For 2019, the plan includes three to eight new services to be implemented. </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Data Exchange</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.<a id="_Toc1474992"></a></p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Authentication Platform (<em>Autenticacao.gov</em>)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.autenticacao.gov.pt/">Autenticação.gov</a> platform brings together the different authentication and electronic signature solutions available to citizens, allowing them a secure access and authentication in the portals and Internet sites of different public entities (such as the Citizen Portal or the Tax Authority Portal). Usable authentication tools are the Citizen Card, the eID-based Portuguese identity card, and the Digital Mobile Key, an ID mobile solution that allows citizens to authenticate solely with a mobile device, thus suppressing the need to use a personal computer with a smartcard reader. 2017 saw the release of a Digital Mobile Key dedicated app to facilitate the use of eID from the smartphone. </p><p>A recent feature of Autenticação.gov is the Professional Attributes Certification System (SCAP), which allows the citizen to authenticate and/or sign on the quality of the professional functions that he/she performs, according to professional or business attributes.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identity Card (eID)</p><p>The <a href="https://www.autenticacao.gov.pt/o-cartao-de-cidadao">Citizen Card</a> is the Portuguese electronic identification card (eID) that provides both visual identity authentication and electronic identity authentication using biometrics and electronic signatures. It allows the holder to provide secure authentication when dealing with digital services and to digitally sign electronic documents. As such, citizens can take advantage of a multi-channel service delivery in their interactions with public and private services.</p><p>The national eIDAS node is implemented and in production on the <a href="https://digiplace.sharepoint.com/sites/WAB-EUROPEANCOMMISSION-ABCIVNIFOFOLLOWUP-OFR17-59354/Documents partages/D05.03 Digital government factsheets 2019/Country Progress/Portugal/ePortugal.gov.pt">ePortugal.gov.pt</a> web-portal - the notification of the Citizen Card is published in the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52019XC0228(01)">OJEU 2019/C 75/04</a>.</p><p class="subtitle"><em>Chave Móvel</em> <em>Digital</em> - Digital Mobile Key</p><p>The <a href="https://www.autenticacao.gov.pt/a-chave-movel-digital">Digital Mobile Key</a> is a mobile authentication mechanism associated to the eID Citizen Card. It is a form of secure online authentication of citizens to the Public Administration, based on a system similar to home banking solutions, through the introduction of a username (citizen’s mobile number), password (defined by the citizen) and a one-time password sent by SMS, e-mail or Twitter account (also defined by the citizen). The main objective is making available a complementary authentication solution through mobile devices, safer than the access via username and password, to electronic public services (more security to the State) and simpler to the citizen (more effectiveness and efficiency to citizens and companies).</p><p>Since December 2017, citizens can also use a Digital Mobile Key app for receiving the one-time password associated with each authentication through a push notification in their smartphone.</p><p class="subtitle">Portuguese Electronic Passport (PEP)</p><p>The <a href="http://www.pep.pt/">PEP</a> represents the beginning of a new generation of eID documents with the most rigorous security patterns. While preserving the features of the traditional passport in the identification of its holder, it integrates innovative components ranging from facial recognition to the incorporation of a contactless chip which allows the automatic processing of entries and exits. All the information contained in the chip can only be read by specialised equipment.</p><p class="subtitle">State Electronic Certification System (SCEE)</p><p>The <a href="http://www.scee.gov.pt/en/">SCEE</a> is an infrastructure of public keys which supports electronic signatures and other electronic security services activated by public keys (algorithms). The SCEE architecture constitutes a hierarchy of trust that guarantees the electronic security of the State and the strong digital authentication of electronic transactions among several public services and organisations, and between the State, citizens and businesses. It allows interoperability with the infrastructures that fulfil the necessary rigorous authentication requirements through adequate technical mechanisms and compatibility in terms of certification policies, primarily within the scope of the EU Member States.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Public eProcurement Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://community.vortal.biz/PRODSTS/Users/Login/Index?SkinName=espap">national eProcurement platform</a> is mandatory for all public authorities and is led by <a href="https://www.espap.pt/Paginas/Home.aspx">ESPAP</a>. There are several private platforms for eProcurement that operate at different institutional tiers. The national portal (<a href="http://www.base.gov.pt/Base/pt/Homepage">BASE</a>) publishes all notices and contract announcements electronically and lists all certified eTendering platforms. Public entities can acquire eTendering services with minimal effort. Calls for tender are published in the <a href="http://www.dre.pt/">Official Gazette Online (DRE).</a> Publication requests can only be submitted electronically. Some innovations are not in general use (e.g. eAuctions, dynamic purchasing systems), and eProcurement in the post-award phase (e.g. ordering, invoicing and contract management), is still in its infancy.</p><p>All public administration contracts are required to be published on this central portal. A user can perform a thorough search, analyse expenses by public sector, public body and enterprise, among other actions. The portal is one of the key examples of transparency efforts involving all Public Administration activity as a whole. </p><p>In 2018, the following eProcurement enhancements were performed:</p><p>Implementation of the travel and accommodation registration platform integrated on the information collection and validation system. This module covers a set of functionalities that allow the report, for subsequent monitoring, of the online acquisition of travel services by the Public Administration.</p><p>Implementation of the new Public Procurement eCatalogue.</p><p>Enhancement of the National Public Procurement System transparency through the implementation of a new set of dashboards for easier monitoring and better governance.    </p><h2><a id="_Toc1474994"></a>eInvoicing</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Invoicing Portal for Public Administration - FE-AP</p><p>An <a href="https://www.espap.gov.pt/spfin/Paginas/spfin.aspx#maintab5">Electronic Invoicing Portal for Public Administration</a> - FE-AP was implemented in 2018 and allows for the receipt of invoices and rectifying documents in electronic format, ensuring the control and monitoring of all stages of the process:</p><p>Receiving;</p><p>Validation;</p><p>Archive;</p><p>Verification;</p><p>Processing in accounting systems.</p><p>The solution is available to any public entity and allows direct integration with the GeRFiP solution or via web services with any other accounting or document management system.
