The strategy represents a development framework defining the preconditions and initiatives needed for rapid adaptation to the increasingly complex digital environment, as well as agile and proactive development of digital Montenegro. It applies to all parts of the Montenegrin society - State administration, local government and the wider public sector, the economy, academia, the scientific community, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society. Challenges in the digital transformation of Montenegro are addressed through two strategic goals that reflect the digital reality. The first focuses on improving the capacity and ability for digital transformation, while the second on strengthening the digital awareness of the Montenegrin society and the digital competitiveness of the information and communication technology (ICT) sector. In order to achieve the desired progress, the two strategic objectives are then channelled into seven operational goals through priority areas or groups of activities. </p><p>Montenegro’s Digital Transformation Strategy is a key component to meet ambitions in the digital field, as well as a means to improve public services and user experience, strengthen the digital skills of the society as a whole, reduce the digital divide, enable the digital transformation and effectively manage it throughout the country.</p><p>The Digital Transformation Strategy is in line with the goals of the new Public Administration Reform Strategy 2022–2026 in the area of eGovernment. Namely, both strategies deal with comprehensive digitalisation in the provision of public administration services and will address the issues of development of interoperability and identification of all relevant stakeholders in ICT and business, as well as their cooperation in the delivery of eServices.</p><p class="subtitle">Public Administration Reform Strategy 2022–2026</p><p>The government of Montenegro adopted the<a href="https://www.gov.me/dokumenta/ab9503b0-5f2e-42ef-b124-b8df949acfaa"> Public Administration Reform Strategy 2022–2026</a> in December 2021. Knowing that a high-quality public administration depends on responsible and competent civil servants, the strategy is focused on empowering public administration employees through the development of the necessary competencies and skills, but also standardisation of the civil service system in public administration. Reform activities concentrate on (i) greater availability of information to make life easier for citizens, especially through the creation of digitalised services and interoperable registers; (ii) use of technology through teleworking; (iii) diversity and involvement of all stakeholders in public administration; and (iv) affirmation of needs expressed by citizens through participation in public consultations, but also direct influence on the operation of bodies with a view to developing their policies based on the identified needs of citizens and the economy in direct communication and cooperation.</p><p>The core values on which public administration reform is based include trust, equality, impartiality, transparency, professionalism, participation and partnership, evidence‑based decision-making, and responsible and efficient leadership and management.</p><p>Public administration reform is one of the key policies in Montenegro’s European Union (EU) membership negotiation process and the document was therefore prepared in accordance with all international standards, including both general and specific objectives, activities and cost estimates for its implementation. By adopting the Public Administration Reform Strategy 2022–2026, Montenegro met a significant obligation, thus creating the preconditions to apply to the EU partners for strong financial support for the implementation of public administration reform, worth over EUR 20 million.</p><p class="subtitle">Smart Specialisation Strategy</p><p>The <a href="http://www.mna.gov.me/ResourceManager/FileDownload.aspx?rId=339846&amp;rType=2">Smart Specialisation Strategy</a> (3S) 2019–2024 of Montenegro follows three key strategic directions:</p><ul><li>Healthier Montenegro;</li><li>Sustainable Montenegro; and</li><li>Modernised and digitised Montenegro.</li></ul><p>The latter should enable reaching the standards of the EU that are related to the 2020 Digital Agenda, the Single Digital Market Strategy and the new EU Industrial Policy Strategy. The development and application of ICT is of utmost importance for economic development. Reaching the standards and achieving the goals will lead to trade development, better use of capital and a stronger national competitiveness. Also, the introduction of modern technologies and the utilisation of available raw materials in priority sectors will result in the placement of high-quality products on the market. The foundations of this direction are related to better infrastructure, eEconomy and information security, but the achievement of this goal is also directly connected with all the priorities defined by the Smart Specialisation Strategy. This is why ICT has been defined as a horizontal sector providing information and technology support to selected priorities.</p><p>In accordance with the suggestions of the European Commission during the approval of the Smart Specialisation Strategy of Montenegro, the government of Montenegro adopted in December 2021 the <a href="https://www.gov.me/dokumenta/1930c6c5-1df9-4393-bef2-6c4b40153edc">Operational Programme (OP) for the implementation of the Smart Specialisation Strategy 2021–2024</a> and the Action Plan 2021–2022.

In this way, the basis was laid to harmonise business processes to comply with the European dimension in terms of provision of public services, security policies, privacy and storage of electronic records, without imposing any specific technology.</p><p>The interoperability framework is not conclusive and requires periodic adjustments in line with changes in the technological sector, of applicable standards and in the environment in which business processes are implemented. This is why a new <a href="http://www.mju.gov.me/ResourceManager/FileDownload.aspx?rid=398232&amp;rType=2&amp;file=Nacionalni okvir interoperabilnosti 2019.pdf">National Interoperability Framework</a> was adopted in 2019. Through its adoption, the government of Montenegro provided a set of recommendations to support the public administration in implementing interoperability activities, establishing relationships among private and public organisations, and simplifying procedures to guarantee efficient and effective digital services while ensuring that existing and new legislations do not undermine the interoperability initiative. </p><p class="subtitle">Montenegrin Health System Interoperability Framework</p><p>Although the provision of public services in almost all cases includes data exchange between information systems, interoperability is a wider concept that provides for the possibility of organising joint work on commonly agreed goals catering to shared interests. Interoperability is also a prerequisite and mitigating factor for the efficient provision of public services and addresses the need for:</p><ul><li>Cooperation between public administration institutions;</li><li>Exchange of information to meet legal requirements;</li><li>Exchange and reuse of information to increase administrative efficiency and reduce administrative burdens on citizens and businesses; </li><li>Better provision of public services to citizens and businesses on a one-to-one principle (one-stop government); and</li><li>Reduction of costs for public administration, businesses and citizens through the effective and efficient provision of public services.</li></ul><p>The ultimate goal of the National Interoperability Framework is to ensure stable and technology-based interoperability of the public administration system, in accordance with the principles of user-oriented administration.

This regulation created conditions for establishing cross‑border interoperability of eID systems, primarily in the Western Balkans, which will improve the regional cooperation of these countries in the field of infrastructure and economic development.</p><p>Montenegro’s commitment to improving cooperation at the regional level is expressed in the <a href="https://www.gov.me/ResourceManager/FileDownload.aspx?rId=383377&amp;rType=2">agreement</a> signed in 2019 by the government of Montenegro and the government of the Republic of Serbia concerning the mutual recognition of certification services for electronic transactions provided in Montenegro and qualified trust services provided in the Republic of Serbia. Mutual interest was shown for this agreement, which was considered useful for both parties and in the future can be a good example of cross-border cooperation with other countries in the region. In 2020, Montenegro also signed an agreement with the Republic of North Macedonia.</p><p>Furthermore, as part of the Third Digital Summit of the Western Balkans in Tirana in 2020, Montenegro and other Western Balkan countries (WB6) signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Regional Interoperability and Trust Services in the Western Balkans. The signing of this memorandum creates the conditions for launching a joint action and initiative to improve regional cooperation, support digital integration as well as exchange information in an open, interoperable, secure and reliable way, giving priority to regional interoperability and trust services.</p><p><a id="_Hlk105570631"></a>Finally, building on the political vision and goals set out in the 2021–2024 Common Regional Market (CRM) Agenda, endorsed by Western Balkan leaders at the 2020 Sofia Summit, Montenegro was a host of Digital Summit 2021. In Podgorica, ministers of WB6 adopted the Ministerial conclusions and agreed the further activities defined through the Statement of Interoperable Western Balkan and the Statement on Free Flaw of Data in Western Balkan, discussed at the ministerial round table second day of the Summit. These statements will, inter alia, contribute to the recognition of eID and electronic trust services, as well as the launch of a pilot project on cross-border services in the Western Balkans.</p><h3>Security aspects</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Cybersecurity Strategy of Montenegro 2022–2026</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gov.me/dokumenta/0094a8e3-a436-49ba-833b-434b35f04cfe">Cybersecurity Strategy of Montenegro 2022–2026</a> has been adopted together with an action plan for the period 2022–2023. Raising the level of cybersecurity at the national level is a kind of pledge for the future, because a secure cyberspace remains an important prerequisite for creating a stimulating environment for continuous economic development, digital transformation and the provision of public services. The Cybersecurity Strategy of Montenegro 2022–2026 is an interministerial document focussing on a five-year strategic period and aiming at improving the overall capacity (legislative, operational, human, financial and technical) to adequately respond to challenges and threats coming from the cyberspace in and outside Montenegro. </p><p>More specifically, the implementation of the strategy aims to create an environment in which citizens, critical infrastructure operators, economic actors and public administration in Montenegro are protected as much as possible from the negative consequences of cyber threats and crime through continuous education on safe use of ICT in everyday life and business, know-how exchange with partners at the regional, national and international level, and implementation of measures to protect critical information infrastructure. Also, the strategy aims to ensure that in the field of cybersecurity Montenegro has a sustainable system for effective detection of and defence against complex vectors of cyber attacks and threats. Finally, it is also planned to establish a new body - the Agency for Cybersecurity - in order to centralise cyber expertise, reduce the outflow of professional staff, enable a more efficient response to cyber attacks and protect critical information infrastructure.</p><h3>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>Interconnection of Base Registries in Various Strategies</p><p>No specific strategy exists regarding the interconnection of base registries, but interoperability is recognised in the <a href="https://www.gov.me/dokumenta/842b56e8-6289-463c-9fff-2db13780737e">Public Administration Reform Strategy</a> and the <a href="https://www.gov.me/dokumenta/0c802520-e016-41ee-a6e4-7af6eb66e19d">Digital Transformation Strategy</a>. More in detail, the necessity of interoperability between base registries and information systems is acknowledged through various activities, such as:</p><ul><li>Providing interoperability of registers and availability of data from the registry of users; and</li><li>Connecting key registers through the interoperability platform. </li></ul><h3>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Public Procurement Development Strategy 2021–2025</p><p>The government of Montenegro has adopted the <a href="https://www.gov.me/dokumenta/8fd20ab6-e472-4825-aca4-23fcd05c6ac2">Strategy for Improving Public Procurement Policy and Public-Private Partnership</a> for the period until 2025, together with an action plan for the period from July 2021 to December 2022. The main goal of the strategy is to build a sustainable, effective and efficient system of public procurement and public-private partnership. It includes chapters addressing the main issues, challenges and risks identified in the public procurement system, priority areas for public procurement reform and priority areas for public-private partnerships.</p><p>In general, the public procurement policy in Montenegro is regulated by the <a href="https://www.katalogpropisa.me/propisi-crne-gore/zakon-o-javnim-nabavkama-3/">Law on Public Procurement</a> (Official Gazette of Montenegro, No. 074/19), which with a set of bylaws created a framework for legal action in the public procurement system. With the successful implementation of the project ‘Implementation of the electronic public procurement system’, which has been implemented since 2018 with the support of the European Commission and financing from the Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), a precondition has been created for the introduction of an electronic public procurement system in Montenegro. In this context, on 1 January 2021 the Ministry of Finance started implementing the new <a href="https://cejn.gov.me/tenders">Electronic Public Procurement System</a>. The main strategic goal of introducing electronic public procurement in Montenegro is, above all, to increase transparency and efficiency in the public procurement system, while also contributing to the fight against corruption and other irregularities. </p><h2>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Integrated Health Information System and eHealth Development Strategy 2018–2023</p><p>One of the priority strategic areas of the strategy concerning the functioning and organisation of the healthcare system at national level is also the development and improvement of an integral eHealth information system.

To that end, it aims to enable eID, i.e. authentication and authorisation of users when using eServices. The system supports centralised management and the use of various electronic mechanisms for authentication and authorisation, as well as various technical solutions. </p><p class="subtitle">ID Card</p><p>In 2020, the <a href="https://ca.elk.gov.me/">eID Card</a> was put into operation, enabling insured persons to use the new eID card as a health card. The new eID card contains two digital certificates - an identification certificate and a qualified electronic signature certificate - by which a citizen, when accessing eServices, can prove his identity and electronically sign a document in a way that has the same legal effect as a handwritten signature. Additionally, citizens who have already received a new eID card will be able, on the website of the Ministry of the Interior, to use some of the eServices that the Ministry of the Interior plans to improve and develop.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>Electronic Procurement System in Montenegro</p><p>Public procurement is an important component of the country’s economic system, directly contributing to realizing the principles of a market economy and directly affecting the national economy, on the one hand, and good management of public finances, on the other.</p><p>During 2020, the Ministry of Finance worked intensively on creating the preconditions for the introduction of the first <a href="https://cejn.gov.me/tenders">Electronic Public Procurement System</a> in Montenegro (<a href="https://cejn.gov.me/landingPage">CeJN</a>).
