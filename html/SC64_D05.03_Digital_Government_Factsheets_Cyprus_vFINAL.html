Based on the Digital Agenda for Europe, the stated overall vision of the Digital Strategy is: "Information and communication technologies to support the development and the competitiveness of the economy, and citizen participation in the social, cultural and political domains.”</p><p>The Digital Strategy for Cyprus is based upon six strategic targets: </p><ul><li><strong>Target 1: </strong>Broaden coverage (infrastructure rollout), expand broadband and establish regulatory framework of networks;</li><li><strong>Target 2: </strong>Modernisation of public administration and provision of more applications and services to citizens and enterprises, namely, eGovernment and eHealth services; </li><li><strong>Target 3: Inclusion of all (including vulnerable groups) into Digital Cyprus. </strong>Increase penetration and participation of all citizens and businesses in the digital society;<strong> </strong></li><li><strong>Target 4: Education and Learning</strong> - improvement of eSkills and digital literacy;</li><li><strong>Target 5: </strong>Promotion of digital entrepreneurship;</li><li><strong>Target 6: ICT for the environment</strong> - promotion of green ICT.</li></ul><p><strong>In 2015, the Cypriot government published the </strong><a href="http://www.mcw.gov.cy/mcw/dec/digital_cyprus/ict.nsf/3700071379D1C658C2257A6F00376A80/$file/Methodology-Analysis_CYDigitalStrategy_Final.pdf">guiding methodology</a><strong> for the implementation of the Digital Strategy of Cyprus.</strong></p><p><strong>In relation to Target 4, the Cyprus Productivity Centre of the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurances, in association with the Department of Electronic Communications of the Ministry of Transport, Communications and Works, launched an educational programme to minimise digital illiteracy and further promote the use of eGovernment services. The programme had a two years horizon (2017-2019) that focused on implementing the number of workshops and training for: </strong></p><ul><li><strong>Learning how to use basic eGovernment services such as the Taxisnet, an online payment service for contributions to social insurance services, and the Ariadni portal, a government secure gateway;</strong></li><li><strong>Improving basic internet skills. </strong></li></ul><p>Training programmes were offered in urban and regional areas to cover the needs of municipalities and smaller communities. From September 2017 to December 2018, 305 workshops were conducted involving more than 4.000 participants. This programme focused on the benefits coming from eGovernment to increase awareness and take up of existing eServices by all.</p><p>For this reason, the Press and Information Office carried out promotional campaigns for the eGovernment programmes offered by the Cyprus Productivity Centre in regard to the usage of existing eGovernment services. The focus of the 2018 campaign was the promotion of the online payment system for contributions to social insurance services.</p><p class="subtitle">eGovernment Strategy 2014-2020</p><p>The eGovernment Strategy referred to the period 2014-2020 and applied to all ministries, departments and services of the Cyprus Government focusing on technical, operational and organisational aspects of the provision of eServices to citizens and businesses. Interventions at back-office systems or government ICT infrastructures were also foreseen by the eGovernment Strategy, provided they assisted the Cyprus Government to achieve its objectives up to 2020, whilst being in line with EU policies and Directives. From the implementation of the eGovernment strategy, the following objectives were aimed at:</p><ul><li><strong>Enhancement of public sector capacity while reducing operational costs;</strong></li><li><strong>Delivering additional eServices, which will be flexible, accessible, complete, simple and secure;</strong></li><li><strong>Facilitate cross-border collaboration at European level.</strong></li></ul><p class="subtitle">Cyprus Start-up Visa 2017-2021</p><p>The <a href="http://www.reform.gov.cy/assets/mainmenu/168/docs/startup_visa_scheme_english_version.pdf">Start-up visa scheme</a> operated on a pilot basis until February 2019, and then the duration of the programme was extended for an additional two years. In this timeframe, a maximum of 300 visas were issued. The project aimed at attracting talented entrepreneurs from the European Economic Area and outside the European Union. To this end, several typologies of facilitations were included to help them in the process of starting a new business.</p><p>The objective was to foster an ecosystem for the creation of new jobs through innovation and research.

SMS is a crucial element of the restructuring plan of the Ministry of Education and Culture, which aims to create an advanced computerised system which will ensure the proper information management and process automation. SMS will contribute to the streamlining of bureaucracy, reduction of high administrative costs and it will ensure the prompt provision of information, cooperation and support of various stakeholders. The different services offered by SMS will be gradually introduced until the expected ending date of the project in 2023. The total cost for the implementation of the system is EUR 9 million. It is co-funded by national state resources and the European Funding Management Unit (EFMU).</p><p class="subtitle">National Coalition for Digital Jobs</p><p>Cyprus launched a <a href="http://www.digitaljobs.cyprus-digitalchampion.gov.cy/el/page/home">National Coalition for Digital Skills and Jobs</a> in support of the European Commission’s call for action within the Grand Coalition.

Cooperation will focus on defining a strategic agenda along with the design and implementation of concrete actions, in order to develop the environment that will enable citizens to better access public sector information and services.</p><p class="subtitle">Public Administration Reform</p><p><a href="http://www.reform.gov.cy/en/">Public Administration Reform</a> is considered a very important structural change at creating flexible, modern and productive public services for the benefit of both citizens and businesses. The political responsibility and supervision of the reform was assigned to the Deputy Minister to the President, under the overall initiative of the Growth Strategy (Unit for Administrative Reform).</p><p>PAR aims to solve horizontal and sectoral issues. In relation to the horizontal/cross-cutting issues, one of the main pain points is human resource management (HRM) across the Public Sector. More specifically, the Government submitted to the House of Representatives a set of draft bills aiming at institutionalising the HRM’s reforms in respect of performance appraisal, promotion, Public Service Commission governance, mobility etc., as well as introducing a mechanism to regulate salary increases that will ensure the affordability and sustainability of the public wage bill.</p><p>With regards to sectoral issues, functional reviews were completed within the civil services domain (Ministries and Constitutional/Independent Services) aimed at the reorganisation of structures within the various ministries and independent authorities, and generally the provision of better services to businesses and citizens. </p><p class="subtitle">Action Plan on Better Regulation</p><p>The Action Plan for Better Regulation Under Implementation (approved by the Council of Ministers on the 29 October 2015), consisted of three priority axes:</p><ul><li>Simplification of procedures and legislation and the reduction of administrative burden;</li><li>Better law-making and impact assessment of new legislation; </li><li>Embedding the culture and enhancing relevant skills in relation to the Action Plan on Better Regulation.</li></ul><p>The third, and final, progress report for the Action Plan for Better Regulation was followed by the Action Plan for the period 2019-2021. This Action Plan included policy areas of high priority for the reduction of administrative burden. </p><p>The new Impact Assessment (IA) mechanism, put in place in 2017 to undertake more focused and thorough impact assessments for new legislation, was embedded and is now a mandatory part of the legal drafting procedure. An IA report summarising the main findings and suggestions for the way forward was published in 2018. Its intention was to continue the training programme of government officials and further enhance implementation of the new impact assessment framework.</p><p>Further to the above three axes, the Action Plan also included actions that are being promoted under the pillar of eGovernment, which go hand in hand with the other Better Regulation initiatives.</p><p class="subtitle">Partnership Agreement </p><p><a href="http://www.structuralfunds.org.cy/Partnership-Agreement">The Partnership Agreement (PA) 2014-2020</a> is the strategic document prepared by the Government of Cyprus for the effective utilisation of funds allocated to the country by European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) for the programming period 2014-2020. The PA includes the general development priorities of Cyprus and the pursuit of general objectives for the use of ESI Funds, as derived from the analysis of the country’s development needs and perspectives, as well as the thematic objectives that Cyprus selected to invest into during the 2014-2020 programming period. </p><p>Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is among the selected sectors for investment, with the main aim being the promotion of use of ICT in the public and private sector, for improving the competitiveness of the economy.

As part of the reform, an electronic court administration system will be introduced to digitise the operations of the different courts. To this end, a tender to purchase a license for a web-based court administration system (eJustice system), including training of personnel, and the option to acquire the system by the Government, was launched. The eJustice system will be installed in the premises of every court in Cyprus, and it will be possible to manage all procedures of a legal case. Additionally, the eJustice system will provide electronic services to court personnel, law offices, police, governmental departments, private law companies, lawyers, the bar association, private companies, citizens and private service provides (e.g. audit firms, land development companies, certifying officers etc.) Pending full implementation of the eJustice system, a mini electronic registry has been prepared and installed in all civil registries of the Supreme Court to process applications more efficiently.</p><p class="subtitle">Information System for Countering Undeclared Work – ERGANI SYSTEM</p><p>The strategy put in place by Cyprus to clamp down on undeclared work is based on two main pillars: legislative support and the introduction of a computerised system to better monitor employers. The first pillar is characterised by a bill that was completed in 2017, the Law of the Undeclared Work N.52(I)/2017. The law imposed hefty fines that amounted to EUR 500 per undeclared worker. At the same time, a legal presumption was introduced into the legislation, which considered that employment was made six months before the date of the infringement, meaning the fine actually amounted to EUR 3 500. There was a limit to the maximum fine of up to EUR 10 000 for those employing up to 10 illegal workers. The second pillar was an information system for countering undeclared work called ERGANI SYSTEM. Through this information system, employers are freed from red-tape procedures, while making use of the data from the information system will contribute to the fight against undeclared work and contribution evasion. The System is under implementation: the first phase completed in 2019.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p>No political communication was adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">European Blockchain Partnership (EBP)</p><p>Cyprus, together with 25 other Member States, signed the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-countries-join-blockchain-partnership">Declaration for Cooperation on a European Blockchain Partnership (EBP)</a>.

DEC, as the competent authority for the implementation of electronic signature framework in Cyprus, decided to modify the existing law governing <a href="http://journals.sas.ac.uk/deeslr/article/viewFile/1756/1693">Electronic Signatures (No. 188 (I)/2004)</a>, which entered into force on 30 April, 2012 (N. 86 (I) 2012). The amended Act was intended to better align with the provisions of Directive 1999/93/EC and to establish a more solid legal framework for the use and legal recognition of Electronic Signatures. In addition, in 2013 the Department issued the Electronic Signatures Regulations (Regulatory Administrative Act - RAA  267/2013). The Regulations defined the issuing procedures of the qualified certificates to be delivered by the Certification Service Providers.</p><p>On 1 July 2016, Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014 came into effect. It replaced the previous Directive for Electronic Signatures 1999/93/EC. It introduced new regulatory procedures for a number of new trust services such as electronic seals, electronic time stamps, electronic registered delivery services etc. To this end, the Department of Electronic Communications (DEC) harmonised the legislation on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market with the above Regulations. Also, this legislation set DEC as the Competent Authority for the implementation of Regulation (EU) No. 910/2014, as the Supervisory Body under (Article 17 of the Regulation), and as the body responsible for keeping the national trusted list (Article 22 of Regulation).</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474966"></a>Security aspects related to digital government</h3><p class="subtitle">The Processing of Personal Data (Protection of Individuals) Law</p><p>The <a href="http://www.cylaw.org/nomoi/indexes/2001_1_138.html">Processing of Personal Data (Protection of Individuals) Law (138(I)/2001)</a> entered into force in November 2001 and was amended by Law <a href="http://www.dataprotection.gov.cy/dataprotection/dataprotection.nsf/697e70c0046f7759c2256e8c004a0a49/f8e24ef90a27f34fc2256eb4002854e7/$FILE/37(I)-2003_en.pdf">37(I)/2003</a>.

On a national level, the key point is the creation of a Central Citizen Data Warehouse, which uniquely links every citizen to the Central eGovernment Portal, the country Cloud integrated electronic health record system (EHR). It would not be difficult to accommodate into this system any non-Cypriot citizen who chooses to obtain a user account and store one's data on the Cyprus Cloud at an annual fee basis.

It was developed by the Public Administration and Personnel Department in collaboration with the Open University of Cyprus and is based on the <a href="https://getdkan.org/">DKAN open source platform</a>. The new portal offers several novelties such as: a larger catalogue of public datasets (geographical, demographic, statistical, environmental data, etc.), an editorial section related to open data, a wide variety of support material for open data publishers and re-users in the form of visual guides, a section to promote apps developed through the use of open data, and an online form for submitting data requests. In addition, the portal’s functionalities include an interface to generate and share data visualisation tools (grids, graphs, maps), as well as a collection of user-friendly APIs to access both data and metadata. The National Web Portal for Open Data was ranked first among the national open data portals of the 28 EU member states by the <a href="https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/edp_landscaping_insight_report_n4_2018.pdf">Open Data Maturity Report 2018</a>. To support and foster the reuse of open data available through the National Web Portal for Open Data, several actions have been promoted. For instance, the second edition of the Cyprus Open Data Hackathon, that took place in September 2018 in Limassol, promoted the development of applications using Public Open Data among computer programmers, analysts, designers, communication and marketing experts, students and advocates.</p><p class="subtitle">Ipodamos - Town Planning and Housing Department’s Integrated Information System</p><p>Cyprus is developing an integrated information system called Ipodamos for the Town Planning and Housing Department that cover the IT needs and demands of the Department, as well as the management of Building Permits from the District Administration Offices.

Currently, with 40 eServices provided, Ariadni is expected to comprise a highly secure environment, and a resilient ‘always on’ service and a capacity to handle high volumes. In terms of functionality, it incorporates a unified registration and authentication service, allowing users (citizens, businesses, institutions, etc.) to conduct their transactions with the relevant Government Organisations over the Internet in a secure manner, with a single set of credentials, using any application, any device, anytime, anywhere. Additionally, Ariadni provides interoperable, secure and authenticated web-based interconnection of back-end systems. The project has been classified as one of the most important infrastructure projects for the successful implementation of eGovernment. Common core Services provided through Ariadni include:</p><ul><li>Common user identity management/authentication and authorisation;</li><li>Single sign-on credentials;</li><li>Common messaging facility;</li><li>Online payments;</li><li>Integration tier, offering reliable, standards-based information exchange between systems.</li></ul><p>Ariadni has been enriched with information/guidelines related to governmental procedures/services that are provided to citizens/businesses. Users can now find a full set of information for each governmental procedure such as, description, relevant legislation, required certifications, fees required etc. Government procedures are categorised by sectors.

GDN is a <strong>broadband network</strong> based on L3 Ethernet technology over which all government systems are interconnected, exchanging information via web workflow technologies. GDN provides a secure and fast interconnection between the various local area networks of the civil service (Intranet) and furthermore facilitates a secure and fast connection of government organisations to the <strong>Government Internet Node</strong> (GIN).</p><p>GIN provides an <strong>interface</strong> between government information systems and the Internet, thus offering Internet, Extranet and Intranet services to all public entities, civil servants, and citizens/businesses. These include connections to private networks of the European Union.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Unified Data Centre (UDC)</p><p>In 2018, the development of a Unified Data Centre (UDC) unified the IT systems of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance (MLWSI).

Thus, eOASIS serves as a records management system.</p><p>The system currently operates in 22 government organisations including the Cyprus Police and serves around 4 000 users. Following the positive findings of a cost-benefit analysis and a comparative study between different software platforms and eOASIS, the eGovernment Board has approved the rollout of eOASIS to all the remaining Government Organisations.</p><p>The deployment of eOASIS will be done in two phases. Phase I is currently in progress and will cover the needs of around 1 100 users, which will be served using the current infrastructure. Phase II concerns approximately 7 000 users and will begin with the tender procedures for the procurement of the hardware, software and services required to accommodate the additional load as an extension to the existing infrastructure.</p><p>The eOASIS was awarded the <strong>FileNet EMEAN Innovation Award</strong> in May 2007, followed by the <strong>Cyprus Innovation Prize</strong>, given by the Employers and Industrialists Federation in June 2007.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eDelivery in Cyprus</p><p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/2016-cy-ia-0054">eDelivery in Cyprus</a>, a project under the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/2016-cy-ia-0054">CEF program</a>me, is building the eDelivery infrastructure in the country.

The Agreement entered into force using Estonian expertise in preparing the policy and Action Plan for the eID (eSignature and eIdentification) project (setting up stages and involving accordingly the stakeholders), which was completed in May 2017.</p><p>In September 2017, the Government announced its intention to have an open tender for the purchase of an eID solution for secure digital transaction tools in the private and public sector. However, in February 2019, the eGovernment Board made a new decision regarding the eID. The Government will prepare a national scheme on eIdentification and eSignature by changing relevant legislation that impacts the competent authorities. The eIdentification providers that will be authorised according to the national scheme will be able to provide eID to the Cypriot citizens.

The project duration is 52 months. The project does not cover municipalities. The integrated information system is expected to be a powerful tool for the upgrading of the services offered by the Department, with purpose that of improvement in the bureaucratic procedures as well as of the average response time to citizens’ requests, and therefore the better and more effective public service.
