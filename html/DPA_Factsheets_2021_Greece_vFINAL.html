The present National Broadband targets are in line with DAE 2020 and Gigabit Society 2025.

The purpose of the Hellenic Open Data Portal is to increase the web accessibility of Greek public administration datasets by providing integrated services, e.g. cataloguing, indexing, storage, search and availability of public sector data and information, as well as online services to citizens and third-party information systems. Greece was one of the first eight countries in the world to offer open data, together with the US, the UK, Australia, and other countries, and was presented as an example of good practices on ePractice.eu.

In the context of achieving the above purpose of public interest, the registered data of the NCIR will be used:</p><ul><li>for the identification of citizens registered in the different public administration registries;</li><li>for the communication of the public sector bodies with the individuals;</li><li>for electronically providing public administration with documents, statements, notifications, and announcements to individuals; and</li><li>in the case of mobile phone numbers, which are certified according to the specific procedure applied by the NCIR, they will be used as a second factor authentication allowing access to digital public services, for which the State considers that a higher level of security is required.</li></ul><p>The registration and updating of the contact details of individuals will be done in one of the following ways:</p><ul><li>electronically, with certified access to a special application through the Single Digital Gateway of the public administration; or</li><li>by visiting one of the Citizens' Service Centers (KEP).</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Registry of Accessible Public Websites and Applications</p><p>The relevant <a href="http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wHUdWr4xouZundtvSoClrL8YsYh3oJ2J48tiDow6HlTE-JInJ48_97uHrMts-zFzeyCiBSQOpYnTy36MacmUFCx2ppFvBej56Mmc8Qdb8ZfRJqZnsIAdk8Lv_e6czmhEembNmZCMxLMtYww3Z7YOEG9_7hsCiqi239d2rr1EYAayYNl27Cdm3Mi">decision</a> sets out the management bodies for the <a href="http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wHUdWr4xouZundtvSoClrL8YsYh3oJ2J48tiDow6HlTE-JInJ48_97uHrMts-zFzeyCiBSQOpYnTy36MacmUFCx2ppFvBej56Mmc8Qdb8ZfRJqZnsIAdk8Lv_e6czmhEembNmZCMxLMtYww3Z7YOEG9_7hsCiqi239d2rr1EYAayYNl27Cdm3Mi">Registry of Accessible Public Websites and Applications (MHDISEF),</a> the terms and conditions of inclusion in the Registry and the technical and operational requirements related to the implementation of MH.DISEF as well as the monitoring procedures for public websites and applications.</p><p class="subtitle">COVID-19 Patient Registry</p><p>Α single reference point has been created making all necessary data for the treatment and control of the pandemic available to all involved bodies.

At the same time, communication between doctors and patients is simplified in terms of eCounselling as well as paperless and remote prescribing. The entities involved are only provided with data directly related to their responsibilities and actions. The operation of the COVID-19 Patient Registry is fully compliant with national and EU law regarding personal data.</p><p class="subtitle">Online Media Registry</p><p>Τhe <a href="https://emedia.media.gov.gr/">Online Media Registry</a> is an application to register with the Electronic Media Business Registry (Articles 52, 53 and 54 of Law 4339/2015). The Electronic Media Business Registry is part of the government initiatives to promote transparency and legitimacy. Privileges of the members of the Registry include the right of access to state advertising, the provision of free anti-plagiarism services in cooperation with the Organisation for Collective Management of Speech Projects, collaborations in research and educational programmes of the National Audio-visual Centre, and accreditation of journalists.</p><p class="subtitle">Hellenic Republic Human Resources Registry</p><p>The Hellenic Republic Human Resources Registry has already been fully implemented in the digital world. It is called <a href="http://apografi.gov.gr/"><em>Apografi</em></a><em>,</em> and provides all necessary data and applications for a more efficient human resource management. Moreover, digital subsystems such as ‘digital organisational structures’, ‘mobility’ and ‘evaluation’ have been added.</p><p>More in detail, digital organisational structures offer a complete digital organisational chart of the public administration reflecting the structure and staffing of all public bodies. Mobility refers to rotation, transparency, speed and efficiency, ensuring that the right employee is in the right place in the public sector. Evaluation means the evaluation of civil servants with the aim of improving their individual performance for the effective operation of public services.</p><p class="subtitle">Business Registries Interconnection System</p><p>The Business Registries Interconnection System (BRIS) infrastructure aims to: </p><ul><li>enable access to information on EU companies for the public; and </li><li>ensure safe and secure interconnection among EU Business Registries.</li></ul><p>According to Directive 2012/17/EU as regards the interconnection of central, commercial and companies registers and Implementing Regulation (EU) 2015/884, Member States should establish an information system that interconnects their central, commercial and companies registers. </p><p class="subtitle">National Naturalisation Registry</p><p>Any non-resident may enter the system by entering his/her surname and passport number via the <a href="http://pf.emigrants.ypes.gr/pf">dedicated Portal</a>, allowing the Greek administration as well as non-resident citizens to be informed at any time of the status of their case. </p><p class="subtitle">Immigration Registry</p><p>A third-country national applying for a residence permit in Greece can apply though a one-stop competent public service and be informed on the progress of the application via the <a href="http://pf.emigrants.ypes.gr/pf">dedicated Portal</a>.</p><p class="subtitle">General Commercial Registry &amp; One-Stop Services for Business</p><p>The new digital <a href="https://eyms.businessportal.gr/auth">General Commercial Registry &amp; One-Stop Services for Business</a> is a flagship project to facilitate eBusiness in Greece. The main objective of the project is the upgrade of the General Commercial Registry to modernise and complete the Registry for the benefit of businesses and the administration. The project also foresees the development of interoperability with other public registries (e.g. Independent Public Revenue Authority, Single Social Security Institution and Police). The aim is to reduce the bureaucratic burden for businesses, while serving the need for an outward-looking general commercial registry in several languages and the design of new certificates.</p><p class="subtitle">Registry of Real Beneficiaries</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gsis.gr/polites-epiheiriseis/epiheiriseis/mitroo-pragmatikon-dikaioyhon">Registry of Real Beneficiaries</a> allows all owners of legal entities and legal entities themselves to register on a public registry, in accordance with Directive 2015/849/EU preventing the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing (Fourth Money Laundering Directive).</p><p class="subtitle">General Electronic Commercial Registry</p><p>A single framework for organising, informing about and using registries of the public administration has always been a standing requirement for transactions with public authorities and the broader public sector. The problems encountered, especially by the business community, included duplication of data, nomenclature interpretation, different encodings, fragmented data collection by authorities and the lack of business historical data. For all these reasons, for many years the commercial sector of the country has been continuously asking to develop a single electronic commercial registry. The creation of a <a href="http://www.businessportal.gr/home/index_en">General Electronic Commercial Registry</a> (<em>Geniko Emboriko Mitroo - </em>G.E.MH.) for all legal forms of business in Greece will assist in the monitoring of commercial enterprises by the State and help the central government and its relevant authorities provide better services to businesses.</p><p>The G.E.MH. project aims at radically reforming the functioning of individual (fragmented) registries for all legal forms of businesses. The project provides for the transition from the current information processing method (primarily manual) and the current task management to a single automated, high-efficiency processing environment.</p><p>When the entire project is completed, the G.E.MH. will be - among other things - a publicity and statistical analysis body at national level, and a means of protection for third parties, both for the General Secretariat of Commerce and the part of the G.E.MH. concerning it, and for the wider public sector.</p><p>The G.E.MH. provides the following digital public services (online completion):</p><ul><li>registering a company with the G.E.MH.; </li><li>registering with central/regional/local governments;</li><li>electronic certificate and copy services;</li><li>electronic application for registration in the General Commercial Registry; and</li><li>publishing registration in the Official Journal or equivalent.</li></ul><p>Network Infrastructure Mapping </p><p>A <a href="https://rinf.mindigital.gr/">Geographic Information System (GIS)</a> has been developed with a web portal that is intended to record all infrastructure available. It is accessible via a user-friendly internet environment. It provides a simple environment for businesses wishing to invest in ICT infrastructure or services, improves the quality of General Secretariat of Telecommunications and Post services to citizens and businesses, serves basic needs and delivers significant benefits. It also serves as a tool for NGA planning.</p><h2>Emerging Technologies</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><p><img src="img/35-636.jpeg" alt="35-636.jpeg" /></p><p>	Cross-border </p><p>Digital Public Administration Services </p><p>7</p><h1><a id="_Toc44061611"></a>Cross Border Digital Public Administration Services for Citizens and Businesses</h1><p>Further to the information on national digital public services provided in the previous chapters, this final chapter presents an overview of the basic cross-border public services provided to citizens and businesses in other European countries. <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/index_en.htm">Your Europe</a> is taken as reference, as it is the EU one-stop shop which aims to simplify the life of both citizens and businesses by avoiding unnecessary inconvenience and red tape in regard to ‘life and travel’, as well as ‘doing business’ abroad.
