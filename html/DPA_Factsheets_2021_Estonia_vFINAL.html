The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><img src="img/35-688.png" alt="35-688.png" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Estonia in 2020. </p><p>	</p><img src="img/35-701.jpeg" alt="35-701.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Estonia’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, scoring above the European average for Principle 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality) and 9 (Multilingualism). Possible areas of improvements are concentrated in the Principles 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) for which the score of 3 shows an upper-medium performance in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. Indeed, the use of e-accessibility specifications to ensure all public services are accessible to all citizens, including persons with disabilities, the elderly and other disadvantaged groups (Principle 7 – Recommendation 14) and the implementation of evaluation mechanisms to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of interoperable solutions (Principle 12 – Recommendation 19) are partial and could be bettered to reach the maximum score of 4. </p><img src="img/35-710.jpeg" alt="35-710.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The Estonian results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall very strong performance with scores of 4 in each layer. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance. More specifically, the score of 2 for Estonia in Recommendation 23, stating that relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level should be consulted when procuring and developing IT solutions, could be improved.</p><img src="img/35-719.jpeg" alt="35-719.jpeg" /><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Estonia’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with internal and external information sources and services, base registries, open data, catalogues, and the conceptual model itself. However, there is room for improvement with regard to security and privacy, where Estonia’s score of 2 is below that of the EU average. More specifically, the use of trust services to ensure secure data exchange in public services (Security and Privacy - Recommendation 47) hinders the overall Estonian score with regard to security and privacy.</p><p>Additional information on Estonia’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1035577"></a><a id="_Toc1474948"></a>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2021 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all eight life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

By way of example, the projects allow the use of predictive analytics to decide where to send the police for traffic regulation, the use of AI to match job seekers with vacancies through the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund, and the use of an AI-assisted application helping to track activities in the farming sector and facilitate information sharing among the authorities monitoring the use of government subsidies to farmers.</p><p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/digitalagenda2020_final.pdf">updated Digital Agenda 2020</a> for Estonia also specifies that, in order to to stimulate innovation, pilot projects on new technologies will be carried out for the development of new solutions for the State Information System and central components, such as AI, blockchain, the Internet of Things, and technologies that foster privacy.</p><p class="subtitle">HANS – AI system</p><p>On 14 September 2020, the Estonian Parliament (<em>Riigikogu</em>) introduced a tool called <a href="https://www.riigikogu.ee/en/press-releases/others/the-riigikogu-has-a-new-system-for-making-verbatim-reports/">HANS – AI system</a>, which supports the work of lawmakers and employees of the <em>Riigikogu</em> by preparing verbatim reports of parliamentary sittings.

The Public Information Act also transposed the provisions of <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0098:EN:HTML">Directive 2003/98/EC</a> on the re-use of public sector information (PSI). As a result, Estonia notified the full transposition of the PSI Directive in July 2009. A newly revised, updated<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12900546">Public Information Act</a> entered into force on 1 January 2015, starting the transposition of the provisions of the revised <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32013L0037">Directive (2013/37/EU)</a> into national law. The full transposition of this Directive is currently under way. The cct is enforced by the <a href="https://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a>. Since 1 January 2008, the act has also been regulating the field covered by the former <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/32230">Databases Act</a> (in force from 1997 to 2007). </p><p>The Public Information Act covers State and local agencies, public law legal entities, and private entities that are performing public duties, including education, health care, social or other public services. Any person can make a request for information, which is then registered; the holder of the information has to respond within five working days. Fees are waived if the information is requested for research purposes. Departments and other holders of public information are required to provide websites and post an extensive list of information on the web. These entities are also required to ensure that information is not outdated, inaccurate or misleading. In addition, email requests are treated as official requests for information. </p><p>Further amendments to the Public Information Act came into force in December 2018, introducing requirements regarding the accessibility of websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies. The aim is to improve accessibility so that the public as a whole, but especially people with special needs, can communicate with the government and use digital government services more conveniently and effectively.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/529032019012/consolide">Public Information Act</a> ensures that citizens, businesses and other branches of the public administration have access to information meant for public use. The aim is to create public control mechanisms with regard to the fulfilment of public duties. </p><p class="subtitle">Archives Act </p><p>The <a href="http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/X2058K5.htm">Archives Act</a> entered into force on 1 May 1998, setting the principles applying to collecting, evaluating, archiving, preserving, and accessing archival documents, and to archiving activities. In particular, the Archives Act provides guidelines for private records entered in the archives' register and the transfer of ownership of private records entered in the archives' register.</p><h3>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474966"></a>Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/527102016001/consolide">Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act</a> was adopted on 12 October 2016 and effectively transposed the EU eIDAS Regulation. The act also replaced the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/114032014012">Digital Signatures Act</a> (DSA), which entered into force on 15 December 2000 and was revised in 2014. The DSA gave digital and handwritten signatures equal legal value and set an obligation for all public institutions to accept digitally signed documents.</p><p>In January 2019, the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/527102016001/consolide/current">amendments to the Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act</a> entered into force. The State Information Authority is now the single competent authority regarding rights and obligations arising from the eIDAS Regulation.</p><h3>Security Aspects </h3><p class="subtitle">Cybersecurity Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/523052018003/consolide">Cybersecurity Act</a> entered into force in May 2018, aiming to strengthen the security of the digital systems used in providing vital and other socially important services to the public. The act establishes the requirements applying to the maintenance of the network and information systems which are essential for the functioning of the society, and the State, and of local authorities’ network and information systems. The act also provides for liability and supervision provisions and serves as a basis for the prevention and resolution of cyber incidents.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474967"></a>Personal Data Protection Act </p><p>The first <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112072014051">Personal Data Protection Act</a> (PDPA) entered into force on 19 July 1996. The act was amended in 2003 to be made fully compliant with the EU Data Protection Directive (<a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995L0046:EN:HTML">95/46/EC</a>), <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12909389">amended</a> again in January 2008, and <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/523012019001/consolide">renewed</a> in 2019. </p><p>The act protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of persons with respect to the processing of their personal data, in accordance with the right of individuals to obtain freely any information that is disseminated for public use.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12909389">2008 version</a> of the act introduced several changes. Firstly, the previous classification of personal data into three groups (non-sensitive personal data, private personal data and sensitive personal data) was replaced by two data categories, namely 'personal data' and 'sensitive personal data', with the latter being the sub-class under special protection. Secondly, all processed personal data are protected and registered by Chief Processors (i.e. controllers) with the <a href="http://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a>, the data protection supervision authority. Moreover, the new PDPA extended all general principles applying to the processing of personal data to the processing of the personal identification code (the unique number assigned to every Estonian citizen and resident). </p><p>From 1 January 2015, the Data Protection Inspectorate may submit reports to the Constitutional Committee of the <em>Riigikogu</em> and to the Legal Chancellor concerning significant matters which have an extensive effect or need prompt settlement emerging in the course of supervision over compliance with the act. The current version of the act can be found <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/112072014051">here</a>. </p><p class="subtitle">System of Security Measures for Information Systems </p><p>On 1 January 2008, the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/13125331?leiaKehtiv">regulation</a> establishing the system of security measures for information systems used for processing the data contained in State and local government databases and for related information assets entered into force. The system consists of the procedure to specify security measures, and the description of organisational, physical and IT security measures to protect data. Importantly, however, the Regulation does not apply to the security of information systems processing State secrets.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474968"></a>Interconnection of Base Registries</h3><p class="subtitle">Estonian Base Registries</p><p>In Estonia, the concept of base registries has been phased out and replaced by the basic data principle. Databases are regulated by <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/529032019012/consolide">law</a> (some of them being established by government regulation in secondary laws) as primary sources of basic data, that is unique data. Hence, in Estonia all registries are base registries involving unique data collected in the respective registries.</p><p>Furthermore, the Business Registries of Estonia and Finland were interconnected with the use of the <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/state-information-system/x-tee.html">X-Road</a> infrastructure. In February 2019, the Estonian Ministry of Justice and the Finnish Patent and Registration Office signed an agreement in Helsinki, providing that data can be exchanged automatically between the Business Registers of the two countries. No amendment to the national legislation was needed to that purpose.</p><p class="subtitle">Business Registry</p><p>The Business Registry is regulated by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/128122011050?leiaKehtiv">Commercial Code</a> and its <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/504042014002/consolide">Amendment</a>, establishing the basic principles of Estonian entrepreneurship and regulating the setting up of companies in the country. In Estonia companies can be registered electronically. </p><p class="subtitle">Population Registry</p><p>The Population Registry is regulated by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/516012014003/consolide">Population Registry Act</a>, providing information regarding its data composition, the procedure for the introduction and maintenance of the Registry, the processing and access to data, the entry of data on residence, and the supervision over the maintenance of the registry. The purpose of this act is to ensure the collection of the main personal data of the subjects of the Population Registry in a single database to be used by the State and local governments to perform their functions.</p><p class="subtitle">Land Registry</p><p>The Land Registry is regulated by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/12769835">Land Registry Act</a>, stipulating provisions with regard to the maintenance procedure, the data content, the entries, the reservation, the documents necessary for registration, the correction of entries, access and extracts, etc.</p><p class="subtitle">Vehicle Registry</p><p>The Vehicle Registry is established by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/compare_original?id=507012014005">General Traffic Act</a>, specifying the content of the registry, the Ministry governing it, what data it contains, and who may access it.</p><h3>eProcurement</h3><p class="subtitle">Public Procurement Act</p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/505092017003/consolide/current">Public Procurement Act</a> came into force in May 2007, with the current version transposing the EU Directives on public procurement. The act includes legal provisions enabling the further development of eProcurement (eAuctions, Dynamic Purchasing System, eCatalogues, etc.) to offer better opportunities to reach a fully electronic procurement tendering process. </p><p>Importantly, the <a href="http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/X40095K2.htm">previous version</a> of the Public Procurement Act (October 2000) had already established rules for the eNotification of public tenders through the country’s Public Procurement State Register.</p><p class="subtitle">Act on Amendments to the Accounting Act </p><p>On 20 February 2019 the Estonian Parliament approved a bill providing that the accounting of the State was to fully switch to electronic invoicing. Starting from July 2019, the public sector could only accept eInvoices. In other words, the <a href="https://www.riigikogu.ee/tegevus/eelnoud/eelnou/667615bb-4a13-4a02-812f-550c5dedeef3/Raamatupidamise seaduse muutmise seadus">Act on Amendments to the Accounting Act</a> (795 SE), initiated by the government, made machine-processable invoices mandatory in invoicing with the public sector, aiming to reduce the workload and the time required in invoicing within the public sector. The act also transposed the EU Directive on eInvoicing. An electronic invoice is a machine-readable document drawn up on the basis of a common standard, sent from one software system to another to avoid entering data by hand.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474969"></a>Domain-Specific Legislation</h2><p class="subtitle">Information Society Services Act </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/504112013008/consolide/current">Information Society Services Act</a> was passed on 14 April 2004 and entered into force on 1 May 2004, implementing EU <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000L0031:EN:HTML">Directive 2000/31/EC</a> on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market. More in detail, the act established the requirements pertaining to information society service providers, as well as the organisation of supervision and liability in case of violation of these requirements. </p><p class="subtitle">Simplified Business Income Taxation Act </p><p>On 1 January 2018, the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/522122017001/consolide">Simplified Business Income Taxation Act</a> entered into force, establishing the concept of business account. The business account was aimed at small companies (one-man private limited companies and self-employed persons) in order for them to operate without bureaucracy. In particular, the act enables a natural person to open a business account with 20% of the balance automatically transferred to the Tax and Customs Board. Therefore, the account holders disclose themselves to the Tax and Customs Board and, in return, need not submit annual reports and tax returns.</p><p class="subtitle">Principles for Managing Services and Governing Information </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/507072017004/consolide/current">Principles for Managing Services and Governing Information</a> (a government regulation) entered into force in March 2021, obliging all authorities to ensure:</p><ul><li>management and quality of direct public services;</li><li>management and quality of processes;</li><li>information governance and quality thereof; and</li><li>every sub-activity of information governance and quality thereof.</li></ul><p>The regulation aims to establish a common view on how to develop, maintain and provide high-quality public services. With this regulation, Estonia adopted a new approach to developing public services. From now on, public services must be life-event based and, where possible, pro-active. Estonia is currently developing a methodology on how to develop and offer such public services.</p><p>Furthermore, the regulation obliges authorities providing public services to maintain an up-to-date list of their own direct public services and of support services provided to other authorities, containing at least significant services. The management of the processes behind the services must have a clear owner. The problem that authorities often face is that they do not have a clear view of their services (as defined in the second article of the regulation). </p><p>The regulation also established a network of coordinators:</p><ul><li>the <a href="https://www.mkm.ee/en">Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications</a> is responsible for the management of direct public services, including determining, sharing and exchanging the information necessary for providing such services;</li><li>the <a href="https://www.aki.ee/en">Data Protection Inspectorate</a> is responsible for organising access to and protection of information; and</li><li>the <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/">Estonian Information System Authority</a> is responsible for the implementation of the requirements applying to the architecture of the State Information System and the key components of the State Information System.</li></ul><p>While executing their tasks, the coordinators have the following functions:</p><ul><li>Planning the main directions for development and the activities supporting such development;</li><li>Issuing guidelines and recommendations;</li><li>Monitoring the implementation of planned activities and the application of guidelines;</li><li>Managing communication;</li><li>Cooperating with other coordinators; and</li><li>Engaging other parties, as necessary.</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Regulation on the Cross-Border Exchange of Information Regarding Health Services </p><p>The <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/akt/120112018003">Regulation on the Cross-border Exchange of Information regarding Health Services</a> came into force in November 2018, aiming to enable people abroad to have better access to medical care and medicines thanks to the electronic exchange of prescription data between countries. Estonia and Finland became the first two countries in Europe to exchange medicine prescription data. Since January 2019, the first EU patients have been able to use digital prescriptions issued by their home doctor when visiting a pharmacy in another EU country: Finnish patients are now able to go to a pharmacy in Estonia and retrieve medicines prescribed electronically by their doctor in Finland. The initiative applies to all ePrescriptions in Finland and to the Estonian pharmacies that have signed the agreement. The novelty of this initiative is that the ePrescriptions are visible electronically to participating pharmacists in the receiving country via the new eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure, without the patient having to provide a written prescription.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474971"></a>Emerging Technologies</h2><p>No legislation has been adopted in this field to date.</p><p> </p><img src="img/35-878.jpeg" alt="35-878.jpeg" /><p>	 Digital Public Administration Governance </p><p>5</p><p>	</p><h1><a id="_Toc37953385"></a>Digital Public Administration Governance</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474973"></a>National </h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474974"></a>Policy</h3><p class="subtitle">Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications</p><p>The <a href="http://www.mkm.ee/en">Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications</a> holds political responsibility for the development of the State information policy.

The card, fulfilling the requirements of Estonia’s Digital Signatures Act, now replaced by the <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/527102016001/consolide">Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Act</a>, is mandatory for all Estonian citizens and residing foreigners over 15 years of age. The eID card is meant to be the primary document for identifying citizens and residents and is used for all activities – governmental or private. In particular, the e<a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/">ID card</a> can be used to vote electronically (since 2005), create a business, verify banking transactions, access medical history (since 2010), and can work as a virtual ticket. Furthermore, the eID card is a valid travel document within the EU. Since 1 January 2007, the card issued by the Citizenship and Migration Board has become valid for 5 years (instead of 10 years previously). In January 2020, more than 1.3 million people in Estonia (almost 98% of inhabitants) had ID cards. </p><p>In addition to being a physical identification document, the card features advanced electronic functions facilitating secure authentication and providing a legally binding digital signature for public and private online services. An electronic processor chip contains a personal data file, a certificate for authentication, a certificate for digital signature, and the associated private keys, protected with PIN codes. The certificates contain only the holder's name and personal code (national ID code). </p><p class="subtitle">Mobile-ID</p><p>The <a href="http://id.ee/?lang=en&amp;id=36881">mobile-ID</a> is the ID-card based identity verification and digital signature solution for users of mobile phones in Estonia. The mobile phone, based on a standardised SIM application, acts as a secure signing device. Thus, similarly to the eID card, the mobile-ID enables authentication and digital signing of documents, bearing the same legal value. The user’s certificates are maintained on the telecom operator’s SIM card and require the user to enter a PIN code to be used.</p><p class="subtitle">Smart-ID</p><p>As an alternative to mobile-ID, Estonia has a new private sector-offered solution for secure authentication, called <a href="https://www.smart-id.com/">smart-ID</a>. The smart-ID can be used to log in to eServices, for online banking and for signing documents. Signatures given with the smart-ID are legally binding, recognised in all EU States and have the same legal effect as handwritten signatures.  </p><p class="subtitle">ePassport</p><p>To comply with EU Regulation <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R2252:EN:HTML">2252/2004/EC</a> on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States, the systems developed by the Estonian Citizenship and Migration Board (CMB) have undergone considerable changes that have been implemented step-by-step.

In addition, users can log in to the portal using the smart-ID from Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The portal allows for digital signatures, the verification of the validity of digital signatures, and documents to be forwarded to and received from other users of the portal.</p><p>The Dokobit Portal provides a quick and easy way to raise the security of any web service to meet the highest demands, making it possible to carry out authentication based on strong authentication devices from different vendors and providing service providers with the opportunity to enter legal signatures on any created data within their service. That way, the portal provides long-term validity and proof of action in courts across the EU. Finally, the portal enables to gather digital signatures for documents that need to be signed by multiple parties, including entrepreneurs, government officials and individuals.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474994"></a>Public Procurement Registry</p><p>The <a href="https://riigihanked.riik.ee/rhr-web/#/">Public Procurement Registry</a> offers an innovative, free, self-service working environment for buyers (i.e. contracting authorities) to organise and tenderers (i.e. economic operators) to participate in public procurements.

The DHX relies on <a href="https://www.ria.ee/en/state-information-system/x-tee.html">X-Road</a> version 6 as transport-level infrastructure. </p><p>The automatic document exchange in the Estonian public sector began in 2006. Due to an irregular Internet connection, sending documents from one document management system to another was challenging. For this reason, the State created a central solution, i.e. the Document Exchange Centre, where documents would be temporarily stored in such situations. The Document Exchange Centre was used by all ministries and agencies in their area of government, county governments, agencies, and inspectorates, but also by most of the local governments, educational establishments, and other institutions of the public sector. In 2009, the European Consortium for Electronic State Awards recognized the Document Exchange Centre as a good service and strategic initiative.</p><p>The transition to the new means of document exchange began in 2017, with the Document Exchange Centre closed at the end of 2018 and the new distributed solution for the exchange of documents, the DHX, implemented at the beginning of 2019.

It will be an interoperable network of AI applications, enabling citizens to use public services with virtual assistants through voice-based interaction. The network will use Kratt, an AI system that is based on a software algorithm that is autonomous, learnable and performs traditional human actions. As outlined in <a href="https://f98cc689-5814-47ec-86b3-db505a7c3978.filesusr.com/ugd/7df26f_19625e00a7b84900b99e952b1ce7d21a.pdf">#KrattAI’s roadmap</a>, many citizens do not know which public agency to contact, they do not have an overview of either their obligations or opportunities offered by government, and communication is time-consuming. #KrattAI aims to foster progress in AI and virtual assistants and use these improvements to refine the design and delivery of digital public services.
