The EIF Monitoring Mechanism (MM) was built on these pillars to evaluate the level of implementation of the framework within the Member States. Whereas during the previous, the MM relied upon three scoreboards, the 2022 edition includes an additional scoreboard on cross-border interoperability, assessing the level of implementation of 35 Recommendations. The mechanism is based on a set of 91 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the four scoreboards (Principles, Layers, Conceptual model and Cross-border interoperability), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/32-920.x-emf" alt="32-920.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Each scoreboard breaks down the results into thematic areas (i.e. principles). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and four means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the EIF MM data collection exercise for Slovakia in 2022, comparing it with the EU average as well as the performance of the country in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/32-921.x-emf" alt="32-921.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Slovakia’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF principles. Slovakia meets the European average for most principles, except for Principles 1 (Subsidiarity and Proportionality), Principle 9 (Multilingualism), and Principle 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency). The lower-middle performance on these principles indicates that Slovakian public administrations should ensure that national interoperability frameworks and interoperability strategies are aligned with the EIF and, if needed, tailor and extend them to address the national context and need (Recommendation 1). Moreover, it could improve their use of information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Recommendation 16), and foster the way in which they evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of different interoperability solutions and technological options considering user needs, proportionality and balance between costs and benefits (Recommendation 19).</p><p><img src="img/32-922.x-emf" alt="32-922.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022 </a></p><p>The Slovakian results for the implementation of the interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 shows a very good performance. Slovakia reaches a maximum score of 4, in line with the European average, for all interoperability layers. To maintain this high performance, an area of improvement linked to Interoperability governance could be for Slovak public administrations to participate more actively in the standardisation work relevant to the needs of all national public administrations to ensure that their requirements are met (Recommendation 24), and to better perceive data and information as a public asset that should be appropriately generated, collected, managed, shared, protected and preserved (Recommendation 30).</p><p><img src="img/32-923.x-emf" alt="32-923.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>Slovakia’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show an excellent performance in the implementation of all recommendations. A possible area of improvement concerns Open data, where the country could enhance the way in which it publishes open data in a machine-readable, non-proprietary formats (Recommendation 42). Similarly, Catalogues could be further improved by putting in place catalogues of public services, public data, and interoperability solutions and use common models for describing them (Recommendation 44). </p><p><img src="img/32-924.x-emf" alt="32-924.x-emf" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2022</a></p><p>The results of Slovakia concerning Cross-border interoperability in Scoreboard 4 show an at upper-middle performance of the country in 12 indicators. Particularly, Slovakia has a high performance above the EU average in Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility) as well as Internal information sources and services, among others. However, the country still has margin for improvement in relation to Principles 9 (Multilingualism) and 10 (Administrative simplification). For instance, efforts could focus on using information systems and technical architectures that cater for multilingualism when establishing a European public service (Recommendation 16) as well as simplifying processes and use digital channels whenever appropriate for the delivery of such European public services (Recommendation 17).</p><p>Additional information on Bulgaria’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through interactive dashboards.</p><table><tr><td><p><strong>Curious about the state-of-play on digital public administrations in this country? </strong></p><p>Please find here some relevant indicators and resources on this topic: </p><ul><li><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/explore/all/cc?lang=en&amp;subtheme=eq.eq_age.eq_aiso&amp;display=list&amp;sort=category&amp;extractionId=ISOC_BDE15EI">Eurostat Information Society Indicators</a>  </li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi">Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI)</a></li><li><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2022">eGovernment Benchmark</a></li></ul></td></tr></table><p>	</p><p><img src="img/32-925.png" alt="32-925.png" /></p><p>2</p><p>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</p><h1><a id="_Toc140676626"></a>Digital Public Administration Political Communications</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474951"></a>Specific Political Communications on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Slovak government signed the Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other European Union (EU) Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies.

At the national level, it accelerated ongoing processes in terms of building the digital market and carrying out various measures that arose from the most recent cross-sectoral policies of the EU. The strategy also reflected the strategic materials and recommendations of international organisations (EU, OECD, UN, G7 and G20) that consider digital transformation to be the key to inclusive and sustainable growth. The strategy puts emphasis on new digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, 5G technology, big data and analytical processing of data, blockchain or high-performance computers, which will eventually become a new engine of economic growth and competitiveness.</p><p>Several areas were identified regarding the necessity to multiply the potential of digital transformation: </p><ul><li>Economy;</li><li>Society and education;</li><li>Public services;</li><li>Rural development; and</li><li>Science, research and innovation.</li></ul><p>The targets of the process are the citizens, whose everyday life should get simpler, and entrepreneurs, whose businesses should be supported by various incentives and whose bureaucratic burden should be eliminated.</p><p>The strategy was followed by the 2019–2022 <a href="https://www.vicepremier.gov.sk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AP-DT-English-Version-FINAL.pdf">Action Plan for the Digital Transformation of Slovakia, </a>which defined particular measures in several priority areas: </p><ul><li>Improvement of education and fostering digital skills and employment for the modern era; </li><li>Creation of a basis for a modern digital economy; </li><li>Improvement of the ability of public services to innovate and use data; and</li><li>Development and practical implementation of artificial intelligence.</li></ul><p>As for the digital government, the ambition is to launch and implement a ‘data-driven State’ concept in the public administration. The aim of the concept is for public administration to adopt decisions based on the best available knowledge. It is necessary to make sure that the institutions know how to use real data and make data-based (and possibly automated) decisions. Transforming the functioning of public administration organisations and processes is also key, so that such analyses can be effectively used. The action plan also proposed the continuous deployment of fully automated public administration services, meaning that the system handles filings automatically based on selected criteria.</p><p>On December 2022, the government of the Slovak Republic approved the <a href="https://www.mirri.gov.sk/sekcie/informatizacia/digitalna-transformacia/akcny-plan-digitalnej-transformacie-slovenska-na-roky-2023-2026/index.html">Action Plan for Digital Transformation of Slovakia 2023–2026 a</a>imed to increase the digitalization of the Slovak economy and targeting especially small and medium enterprises and innovative businesses.

Subsequently, it will be necessary to build 5G networks to support autonomous and connected mobility and smart transport systems with expected massive utilisation in the future; and</li><li>Internet of Things (IoT), in particular in the context of education. In fact, various primary and secondary school and university curricula in Slovakia have already been extended with matters concerning IoT, thanks to which Slovak students have excellent results in IoT and robotics. </li></ul><p>In order to carry out effective measures in the mentioned priority areas, it is necessary to strengthen the institutional background that constitutes the basis of the innovation ecosystem. The <a href="https://www.vicepremier.gov.sk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AP-DT-English-Version-FINAL.pdf">2019–2022 Action Plan for Digital Transformation of Slovakia</a> defined the ambition to create and strengthen the institutional background in order to bring the benefits of novel technologies across all economic and societal sectors. This could be achieved by supporting the set-up of the different areas in order to facilitate its uptake. The possible measures include: </p><ul><li>Support to activities of the Digital Coalition (still ongoing);</li><li>Support to setting up and connecting DIHs in Slovakia (currently final <a href="https://challenge.gov.sk/narodna-sutaz-europske-centra-digitalnych-inovacii-na-slovensku/">phase</a>);</li><li>Support to setting up and operating a platform for research on and use of Artificial Intelligence (still ongoing);</li><li>Support to setting up and operating a national high-performance computing competence centre (NSCC is established, more information <a href="https://eurocc.nscc.sk/">here</a>); </li><li>Support to setting up and operating the national competence and coordination centre for cybersecurity (this measure is completed); and</li><li>Support to implementation of use of Blockchain technology (this measure is completed in cooperation with Social Insurance Company)</li></ul><p>In December 2022, Slovakia launched the <a href="https://www.mirri.gov.sk/sekcie/informatizacia/digitalna-transformacia/akcny-plan-digitalnej-transformacie-slovenska-na-roky-2023-2026/index.html">2023–2026 Action Plan for Digital Transformation of Slovakia,</a> as a follow-up to the previous Action Plan. This is built upon the following pillars:</p><ul><li>Building a digital ecosystem;</li><li>Support the digital transformation of enterprises and digitalisation of the broader economy;</li><li>Support the digital infrastructure, high-performance computing and quantum technologies;</li><li>Support the AI potential and AI application; and</li><li>Support the digital society (women in digital economy, impact of digitalisation on mental health, green digital transformation, support of financial innovation and technology deployment).</li></ul><p class="subtitle">Permanent Commission for Ethics and for the Regulation of Artificial Intelligence </p><p>As one of the measures of the <a href="https://www.vicepremier.gov.sk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SDT-English-Version-FINAL.pdf">2030 Strategy for the Digital Transformation of Slovakia</a>, the <a href="https://www.mirri.gov.sk/sekcie/informatizacia/digitalne-inovacie/stala-komisia-pre-etiku-a-regulaciu-umelej-inteligencie/index.html">Permanent Commission for Ethics and for the Regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> was set up in November 2020. The Permanent Commission for Ethics and for the Regulation of AI is an independent advisory body made of experts from various fields, who act in their own capacity. Its main goals are to assess ethical and regulatory framework issues arising from the development, deployment and use of AI technologies, as well as preparing opinions on legislation in the field of the ethical aspects of AI. The Commission may also comment on draft laws at national level or legislative acts at international level. It holds regular meetings over the year and it provides the  Ministry of Investments, Regional Development and Informatisation of the Slovak Republic with its expertise in the area of AI and its regulation.  </p><h3>Distributed Ledger Technologies</h3><p class="subtitle">Participation in the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure</p><p>Slovakia has been a member of the European Blockchain Partnership since 2018 and part of the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure since 2020. Under the umbrella of the Recovery and Resilience Plan, Slovakia will invest into extending EBSI nodes within its borders. Slovakia will deploy a network of distributed blockchain nodes and fully participate in EBSI pilot projects. Slovakia aims to use EBSI infrastructure also in national eGovernment projects. </p><h3>Big Data</h3><p class="subtitle">Involvement in the European Digital Innovation Hubs</p><p>The Slovak Recovery and Resilience Plan supports the overall takeover of cloud, big data and AI technologies by small and medium enterprises. This goal will be attained by building a network of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH) and Digital Innovation Hubs (DIH) across Slovakia. The network will be spread regionally in order to ensure equal and easy access to services, and they will have a double function: first, they will map the stage of digital maturity of companies in the given region; and second, they will prepare and provide individual digital or technical solutions tailored to their clients. They will use solutions mostly based on new technologies, including cloud, big data and AI, plus other technologies and digital instruments mentioned in the Digital Europe programme. </p><p>All entities will provide tailor-made services to their clients - mostly SMEs, but they may also include public authorities and large companies. In Slovakia, one of the major barriers to adopt new technologies by businesses is a low capitalisation of SMEs specifically; therefore, the services offered by EDIHs/DIHs will be provided for free or for a price lower than the market price. The Hubs will be involved in the wider European network, which is being built with the financial support of the Digital Europe Programme. Four hubs were commissioned by the end of the 3rd quarter of 2022, as defined in the RRP: (i) ECDI Cassovium, (ii) Kempelenov inštitút inovatívnych technológií, (iii) Slovenské centrum digitálnych inovácií, and (iv) ZINTECH.</p><h3>Cloud Computing</h3><p class="subtitle">Digital and Data Transformation</p><p>The <a href="https://www.slov-lex.sk/legislativne-procesy/-/SK/dokumenty/LP-2021-628">National Concept of Informatisation of Public Administration of the Slovak Republic</a> contains a chapter, “Digital and data transformation”, which deals with services based on cloud.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3>High-performance Computing </h3><p>Involvement in Quantum Research and High-Performance Computing</p><p>Slovakia contributes to quantum research and the high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. The goals are under the umbrella of the RRP. Slovakia is a member of EuroHPC, which has already started to launch dedicated calls for the development and deployment of supercomputers that will be integrated into high-performance computing infrastructure. Slovakia is preparing investment into the top European supercomputer with very high energy efficiency.<br />Moreover, as part of the RRP investments, Slovakia will create a quantum communication network of three links with twelve nodes between research and development centres across the country. The first six nodes will be put into operation before the end of 2023. Building on that, the infrastructure will be made available for industrial and public-sector users. Slovakia is also involved in the cross-border European project <a href="https://quapital.eu/index.php?id=1">Quapital</a> and, in October 2020, it established the first functional link between two capitals in the world: Bratislava and Vienna. The next phase of creating a quantum communication ecosystem will consist of extending the links to bordering countries and beyond. The quantum communication infrastructure consists of the following elements:</p><ul><li>Link Vienna - Bratislava Slovak Academy of Sciences (SAV) - Slovak University of Technology Bratislava (STU) - Trnava - Trenčín - Žilina - Liptovský Mikuláš - Prešov - Košice (prospectively expected to continue to the Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine);</li><li>Link Bratislava - Nitra - Zvolen - Banská Bystrica; and</li><li>Link Bratislava - Komárno (prospectively continued to Hungary).</li></ul><p>The Slovak RRP will co-finance the building of the QCI terrestrial network and the development of single quantum photon detectors. Besides that, international connections are planned with neighbour countries and satellite components in the future.</p><h3>High-speed Broadband Connectivity</h3><p class="subtitle">National Broadband Plan </p><p>In the course of 2020, experts prepared the <a href="https://www.mirri.gov.sk/aktuality/digitalna-agenda/vicepremierka-remisova-predstavila-narodny-plan-pristup-k-ultra-rychlemu-internetu-maju-mat-do-roku-2030-vsetky-domacnosti/index.html">National Broadband Plan</a>, which was approved by the government of the Slovak Republic on 17 March 2021. The vision of Slovakia is to ensure access to a telecommunication infrastructure that will be able to fulfil the quality and capacity requirements of networks in terms of the Gigabit Society for all citizens, entrepreneurs and public administration. The fulfilment of this vision will be achieved by the following goals by 2030:</p><ul><li>All households, whether rural or urban, shall have access to the Internet at a speed of at least 100 Mbps with the possibility of expansion to gigabit speed; and </li><li>All-important entities of socio-economic interaction, such as schools, transport hubs, major public service providers, as well as enterprises using digital services, will have access to gigabit connectivity, on the passive part of the infrastructure that will not require replacement in the future due to increasing capacity or other quality and technology requirements.</li></ul><p>The mapping of broadband to addresses and the feasibility study of the National Broadband Plan are in the final stages.</p><p><img src="img/32-933.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

The aim of the feasibility study is to elaborate in more detail the rules, parameters and requirements for the preparation and implementation of broadband interventions. In January 2023, the 1<sup>st</sup> version of the feasibility study was presented to the relevant stakeholders. We expect to collect relevant comments from the expert community and deliver the final version of the feasibility study in April 2023. The next step will be the preparation of other necessary documents required for the implementation of the planned interventions.</p><p><img src="img/32-934.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" /></p><p>Mapping of the High-speed Broadband Connectivity</p><p>The Ministry of Investments, Regional Development and Informatization of the Slovak Republic, in cooperation with the Regulatory Authority for Electronic Communications and Postal Services, started in November 2022 the implementation of mapping and public consultation on the availability of high-speed broadband connectivity (min. 1 Gbps) throughout Slovakia. The public consultation will collect information on the commercial plans of operators to cover Slovakia for the next 3 years (until 12/2025). On 4 November 2022, a working meeting was held to launch the mapping and public consultations, where the requirements for data collection on current and planned broadband coverage were presented and explained to the participants (companies operating on the telecommunications market). The deadline for the delivery of the data was set for 10 February 2023. 40 telecommunications operators provided the requested data. The data will be processed and by the end of April 2023 the status of white addresses in Slovakia will be assessed. Subsequently, this information will be used to prepare interventions to cover white addresses in Slovakia - in accordance with the rules on the use of public resources for these purposes.</p><h3>GovTech</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><p><img src="img/32-935.png" alt="32-935.png" /></p><p>3</p><p>Digital Public Administration Legislation </p><h1><a id="_Toc140676627"></a>Digital Public Administration Legislation</h1><h2><a id="_Toc1474962"></a>Specific Legislation on Digital Public Administration</h2><p class="subtitle">Information Technologies in the Public Sector Act No. 95/2019 </p><p>The <a href="https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2019/95/20210101.html">Information Technologies in the Public Sector Act No. 95/2019</a> (ITPS) was published in March 2019. The act repealed and amended the former law from 2006 as a reaction to the general advancement in the digitisation of the Slovak public sector. The Cybersecurity Act serves as national NIS-based legislation and it provides a general national cybersecurity framework for essential services, but it does not cover the public sector specifically. Therefore, this element was added to the new ITPS act. This act sets out cybersecurity measures specific for the public sector and it covers all public bodies, even those who do not meet the definition of ‘essential services operator’. The ITPS act also strengthens the competences in proactive Computer security incident response team (CSIRT) services of the Slovak government CSIRT, which include scanning, testing from the internet or governmental network, cybersecurity audits, and hardening or penetration testing of the public bodies' IT.</p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-936.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

This act provides a legal framework for operation of public administration bodies in electronic manner, e.g. the  number of key elements, such as pursuance by proxy, base registries, eDesk modules document conversion, electronic payment of fees, authentication of persons in public administration information systems, eDelivery, eForms, electronic personal mailbox and the administration and operation of a central portal for public administration and Integrated Service Points (ISPs) for assisted public administration eServices. Furthermore, it also laid down the foundation for a common data layer by defining a common central module for intergovernmental communication. This module implemented the rules and processes for data exchange among IT systems from different segments (see 4.2.4 Interconnection of Base Registries) and applied the concepts of Master Data Management. This act is updated regularly according to current needs and domestic or international requirements.</p><p>After 10 years of experience with regulation laid down by Act No. 305/2013, The Ministry of Investments, Regional Development and Informatization of the Slovak Republic has decided that it is necessary to adopt a new act on eGovernment. The main reasons for this decision were the overall developments in the IT sector and the fact that Act No. 305/2013 was designed with idea of digitalisation of traditional paper procedures from the official agenda (public services and official proceedings) provided to the public, which has become outdated. The new act on eGovernment naturally abandons that idea and aims to create a comprehensive digital alternative for the official agenda based on current needs and the currentcapabilities offered by information technologies. Legislative works on a new act on eGovernment have been initiated at the end of 2022 and it is expected to continue throughout 2023.</p><p class="subtitle">Amendment No. 134/2020 and No. 416/2020 to Act No. 305/2013 on eGovernment </p><p>The <a href="https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2019/211/20200701" target="_blank">latest amendment</a> to the eGovernment Act entered into force on 30 December 2020. The listed legislation introduced the following changes: </p><p>The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Investments and Informatisation of Slovakia, which was the administrator of the Central Government Portal, has been transformed into The Ministry of Investments, Regional Development and Informatization of the Slovak Republic; and</p><p>The Financial Administration of the Slovak Republic sends official documents only to electronic mailboxes on the Central Government Portal.</p><p>Implementing rules for the Act No. 95/2019 Coll. on Information Technologies in Public Administration:</p><p>The following decrees are meant to implement the Act No. 95/2019 Coll. on Information Technologies in Public Administration:</p><ul><li>Decree No. 78/2020 Coll. on Standards for Information Technologies of Public Administration;</li><li>Decree No. 85/2020 Coll. on Project Management;</li><li>Decree No. 179/2020 Coll.

According to the provisions of Par. 1 of the act, in the performance of their official tasks, public authorities are obliged and authorised to obtain and use data stored in public administration information systems to produce extracts, and to provide such data and extracts when necessary.</p><p>Moreover, an amendment to the Act against Bureaucracy No. 177/2018 eliminated the need for citizens to provide eleven types of paper documents in their dealings with the authorities.</p><p>The amendment to the Act against Bureaucracy (14 April 2019) relieved citizens and companies of their duty to submit further statements and confirmations by using the public administration information system. This resulted in less administrative burden and in simplified processes related to the confirmation of arrears within social insurance, health insurance calculations, confirmation of school visits and extracts from the register of NGOs.</p><p>In July 2021, the government of the Slovak Republic adopted an amendment to Act No. 177/2018. Following the amendment, the list of documents that citizens and businesses had to obtain and deliver to public authorities within their proceedings was further reduced by 21. Citizens will no longer be required to submit what accounted for more than 4 million papers per year, which will result in savings of approximately EUR 40 million per year. At the same time, The Ministry of Investments, Regional Development and Informatization of the Slovak Republic is in the process of implementing a unique systematic Data Program, which is aimed to support the implementation of data activities across the entire public administration in order to dynamise and digitally help the public administration.</p><p>The adoption of the amendment will enhance the automatisation of the processes and pro-active services of the State. The data automatically retrieved by public authorities from the available registries include birth, marriage and death certificates, confirmation of address changes, certificates stating the existence of a business subject, certificates proving a business is not in liquidation or bankrupt or that it does not employ workers illegally.</p><p class="subtitle"><img src="img/32-937.png" alt="A picture containing night sky

Description automatically generated" />Act on Data</p><p>The Slovak Act on Data aims to create a general regulation for data management of the public sector bodies which is an area that is not sufficiently and suitably covered by the existing legal regulation incorporated in previously mentioned acts. The Act on Data serves as an important part in the transformation of Slovakia into a truly digital State, i.e. a State that exploits the full potential of data in accordance with the interoperability principle, accessibility and data quality requirements. It will also help Slovakia become a State that makes its decisions on the basis of expert data from analyses, predictions and evaluations using current, available, accurate and complete data. The first legislative works on the Act on Data began already in 2018. Since then, the act has undergone a thorough elaboration, going from being a simple and very general regulation to a sophisticated and comprehensive one, which reflects contemporary needs in the field of public sector data management. The act sets out the rules for data sharing within the public sector itself and from the public sector to the public, implements MyData concept for natural person and legal entities, bolsters the existing open data regulation and enhances and improves public sector data accessibility for analytical purposes. It is expected that the Act on Data will be finished in 2023 and adopted in 2024.</p><h2>Key Enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474964"></a>Open Data, Reusability and Access to Public Information</h3><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474965"></a>Act on Free Access to Public Information No. 211/2000</p><p>The <a href="https://www.slov-lex.sk/pravne-predpisy/SK/ZZ/2000/211/20210101.html">Act on Free Access to Information</a>, which came into force on 1 January 2001, defined the term ‘public information’ and established a general principle of free and unlimited access.
