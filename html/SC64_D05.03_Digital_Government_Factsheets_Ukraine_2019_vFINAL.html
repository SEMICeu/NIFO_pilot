Accession to the Convention on a Common Transit Procedure and use of NCTS allows businesses to move goods from one country to another based on the single transit customs declaration (the so-called T-1 customs declaration).

This normally takes about a year. For this purpose Ukraine adopted a dedicated <a href="http://sfs.gov.ua/diyalnist-/plani-ta-zviti-roboti-/354871.html">Roadmap</a> and agreed with the EU on the supply of an IT tool similar to NCTS. The supply of which is expected in 2020.
