The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below. </p><p><img src="img/35-222.png" alt="35-222.png" /> </p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021 </a></p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the third EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Malta in 2021. </p><p><img src="img/35-272.png" alt="35-272.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Malta’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall good implementation of the EIF Principles, despite the lack of data for Principle 7 (Inclusion and Accessibility), as the country scores above the European average for Principle 9 (Multilingualism).  Areas of improvements are concentrated in Principle 4 (Reusability) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) and particularly on Recommendation 06, calling for the reuse and sharing of solutions, and cooperation in the development of joint solutions when implementing public services and on Recommendation 19 calling for the evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of interoperability solutions.</p><p><img src="img/35-289.png" alt="35-289.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>The Maltese results for the implementation of interoperability layers assessed for Scoreboard 2 show an overall good performance with scores of 3 and 4. Potential areas of improvement to enhance the country’s implementation of the recommendations under Scoreboard 2 are concentrated in the areas of interoperability governance and integrated public service governance. More specifically, Malta should actively participate in standardisation work relevant to its needs so as to ensure that all requirements are met when it comes to interoperability governance (Recommendation 24). Additionally, it should further ensure interoperability and coordination over time when operating and delivering integrated public services by putting in place the necessary governance structure (Recommendation 25). </p><p><img src="img/35-303.png" alt="35-303.png" /></p><p>Source: <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2021</a></p><p>Malta’s scores assessing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 show a good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with internal information sources and services, base registries, security and privacy and open data. However, some improvements can be made in implementing recommendations related to the conceptual model itself, as well as with regards to external information sources and services. Precisely, the lack of a common scheme for interconnecting loosely coupled service components and putting in place the necessary infrastructure for establishing and maintaining public services (Conceptual Model - Recommendation 35) hinders the overall Maltese score on the conceptual model. Additionally, the use of external information sources and services while developing public services could improve the score on the external information sources and services category (External information sources and services – Recommendation 45).</p><p>Additional information on Malta’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p>The graph below presents the main highlights of the latest eGovernment Benchmark Report, an assessment of eGovernment services in 36 countries: the 27 European Union Member States, as well as Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, the Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Albania and Macedonia (referred to as the EU27+).</p><p>The study evaluates online public services on four dimensions:</p><ul><li>User centricity: indicates the extent to which a service is provided online, its mobile friendliness and its usability (in terms of available online support and feedback mechanisms).</li><li>Transparency: indicates the extent to which governments are transparent about (i) the process of service delivery, (ii) policy making and digital service design processes and (iii) the personal data processed in public services.</li><li>Cross-border services: indicates the extent to which users of public services from another European country can use the online services.</li><li>Key enablers: indicates the extent to which technical and organizational pre-conditions for eGovernment service provision are in place, such as electronic identification and authentic sources.</li></ul><p>The 2022 report presents the biennial results, achieved over the past two years of measurement of all nine life events used to measure the above-mentioned key dimensions.

It sets out how the government will act not only in its traditional role as promoter and regulator, but also as incubator and accelerator for change towards digitalisation. </p><p>It is built around a vision of establishing digital as the key driving force for transformation – where life in Malta is further improved, business thrives, and government services are more accessible. To achieve this vision, several goals have been identified that the nation will work towards while the Strategy is being implemented. These goals are supported by six guiding principles that encompass how digital should be applied and focused. Consequently, one of the strategy’s focal points addresses the diverse needs, requirements, and expectations of various cohorts of Malta’s society and economy – specifically, the way digital can make a real difference in daily life, the digital opportunities that arise, and the related challenges that will need to be addressed from a three-pillar perspective - society, business and government.</p><p>Another of the strategy’s focal points looks at how digital can shape and strengthen Malta’s economy. More specifically, this is being addressed through a strategic course of action that investigates growth through innovation and further digital strategic focus on various sectors of social and economic importance. Government plays a leading role by further investing in emerging technologies, such as by setting up a digital innovation hub (DIH), providing access to government open datasets, expanding funding for research and innovation (R&amp;I), and cultivating an ecosystem that is conducive to and supportive of digitalisation.</p><p>Undoubtedly, attention must also be paid to a number of enablers, among which  those related to regulation and legislation, digital infrastructure and funding, as well as cybersecurity, data and eSkills are key.</p><p class="subtitle">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</p><p>In December 2020, the Maltese government signed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/berlin-declaration-digital-society-and-value-based-digital-government">Berlin Declaration on Digital Society and Value-Based Digital Government</a>, thus re-affirming its commitment – together with other EU Member States – to foster digital transformation in order to allow citizens and businesses to harness the benefits and opportunities offered by modern digital technologies. The Declaration aims to contribute to a value-based digital transformation by addressing and strengthening digital participation and digital inclusion in European societies.</p><p class="subtitle">New Strategy for the Public Service – Achieving a Service of Excellence</p><p>In December 2021, the public service launched a new strategy for the next five years, called <a href="https://publicservice.gov.mt/en/Documents/Achieving-A-Service-of-Excellence-2021.pdf">Achieving a Service of Excellence</a>. A steering committee headed by the Principal Permanent Secretary was set up and four working groups reporting to this committee were formed: three groups were exclusively focused on the three main pillars this strategy is based on - people, technology and services, while the fourth group was focused on drafting the final document. The vision outlines what the forty-five main initiatives and eleven strategic objectives captured in the plan aim to achieve – a seamless public service that is accountable, sustainable and that continually strives to provide a service of excellence. A study on public service renewal commissioned in 2020 highlighted the need to focus the efforts on improving the quality of services, the accountability towards clients, as well as the sustainability as a large organisation. Public service values are intended to inspire respect, promote ethical conduct, acknowledge the highest integrity standards, safeguard clients’ rights, and promote a culture that embraces honesty, correctness and professionalism. In order to support these values, a set of guiding principles have been identified – effective leadership, holistic people management and employee empowerment, ongoing measurement, continuous improvement, decision making and policy making and client centricity. A strategic plan with tangible outcomes and milestones was compiled and for each initiative and strategic objective a champion has been identified.</p><p class="subtitle">Centralised Digital Enabling Services Policy</p><p>The <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GMICT_P_0121_Centralised_Digital_Enabling_Services.pdf">policy</a> published in December 2019 aims to encourage the use of centralised digital enabling services within the public administration and guide the adoption of alternative services in order to ensure data security. The policy recommends that all government bodies and agencies should, unless they have specific needs, give priority to the following centralised digital enabling services provided by the government:</p><ul><li>Cloud services, especially for storing, processing, transmitting or sharing classified information;</li><li>Electronic payment service (government payment gateway)</li><li>Notifications service and</li><li>Video streaming service.<a id="_Toc1474952"></a></li></ul><p class="subtitle">National Data Strategy</p><p>The National Data Strategy 2022–2027 (to be published in 2022) aims to build upon the exponential growth of data and the various technologies used for its collection, processing, storage, preservation and transmission, whilst also addressing the challenges met on a national scale over the past years. It aims to engender the general principles of fairness and transparency so that individuals, and public and private sector organisations can process data to the maximum extent possible, as permitted by the law, for the benefit of natural or legal persons owning that data.

The strategy was one of the action items proposed by <a href="https://digitalmalta.org.mt/en/Documents/Digital Malta 2014 - 2020.pdf">Digital Malta – National Digital Strategy for the years 2014–2020</a>. The key principles of the National Cyber Security Strategy aimed to reflect the various facets of cybersecurity and the essential underlying complex nature of cyberspace. Under the direction of the National Cyber Security Strategy Steering Committee, the MITA launched a campaign focusing on all strata of civil society to instil a culture towards cybersecurity awareness. The target audience included the general public, SMEs, the public sector, students and IT professionals. To achieve this, a variety of communication media were used, mainly social media, traditional media such as television, radio and news portals, together with a dedicated website. Activities included drama via TV and theatres, training, surveys, focus groups, workshops, competitions and awards.</p><p>A new Cyber Security Strategy is currently being finalised following workshops held with the academia, the public sector and the general public. The new Strategy will cover the years 2022 to 2024, and is scheduled for publishing in Q2 of 2022. </p><p class="subtitle">Security Governance and Operations</p><p>With regards to cybersecurity within the public sector, the MITA articulated, published and communicated <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GMICT_P_0016_Information_Security.pdf">an Information Security Policy</a>. This policy is based on the ISO27001 Information Security International Standard and is applicable to everyone within the public sector. As part of its Security Governance framework, the MITA started scanning all government websites that utilised its infrastructure for the identification of vulnerabilities and subsequent rectification by the respective owners. A Client Protection Framework was developed to provide business owners with visibility on the security position in the areas for which they are responsible. This was an innovative project which re-designed the way the MITA sought to provide assurance to its clients that the infrastructure on which government data resided was adequately safeguarded from the ever-increasing threats defining today’s cyberspace. The MITA heavily invested in cutting-edge technology to provide its clients with the ability to continuously scan for vulnerabilities and obtain real-time visibility on the operational health and security profile of environments hosted on its new Hybrid Cloud Enabling Infrastructure. Information security included three main dimensions: confidentiality, availability and integrity, and involved the application and management of appropriate security measures for a wide range of threats, with the aim of ensuring sustained business success and continuity, and minimising impacts of information security incidents (reference <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/66435.html">ISO/IEC 27000</a>). Additionally, The MITA invested in tools to aid in the detection and prevention of cybersecurity incidents, including adequate training of its employees throughout the organisation, and collaboration with other governmental departments to ensure a centralised and cohesive approach in this domain.</p><p>Messages to the public pertaining to cybersecurity are channelled through Malta’s cybersecurity <a href="https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/">page</a>, stemming from a national cybersecurity strategy which was drafted by the MITA by appointment of the government, subsequently followed by the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MITA-Strategy.pdf">Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) 2021–2023 Strategy.</a> </p><p class="subtitle">Launch of the National Cybersecurity Awareness and Education Campaign</p><p>On 16 October 2018, the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation, in the presence of the Minister for National Security and Home Affairs, launched the <a href="https://cybersecurity.gov.mt/resource_articles/launch-of-a-national-cyber-security-awareness-and-educational-campaign/">National Cybersecurity Awareness and Education Campaign</a>. As stated, the Campaign, which was one of the key goals of the National Cybersecurity Strategy published in 2016, was based on the government’s belief in the need for the entire Maltese society to be fully aware of cyber risks and the security measures to be taken. The Campaign targeted the general public, the private sector as well as the public sector – as the largest holder of critical and sensitive information – through practical training and promotional initiatives.</p><p class="subtitle">Implementation of the NIS Directive </p><p>The Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Unit (CIIP) Unit, part of the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Directorate in the Ministry for Home Affairs, National Security and Law Enforcement, is the national competent authority (NCA) overseeing the implementation of L.N. 216 of 2018, being the transposition of EU Directive 1148 of 2016, better known as the NIS Directive. In its capacity as the NCA for Malta, the CIIP Unit regulates CIIs, OESs and DSPs as well as the implementation of national measures to address the requirements emerging from the above-mentioned law. </p><p>This legislation aims to improve the national security capability of the country; enhances cross-border collaboration between EU NIS national competent authorities; and upgrades national supervision of critical sectors.

This importance is not connected solely to our professional life but also to our quality of life. Whilst ensuring that society at large develops the right competence and capability to secure a better future, the need to revisit the effectiveness of strategies leading to the acquisition of digital skills by individuals, society, industry and Malta as a country is clear. This <a href="https://eskills.org.mt/en/nationaleskillsstrategy/Documents/National_eSkills_strategy.pdf">Strategy</a>, launched by the eSkills Malta Foundation in March 2019, was aimed to complement initiatives at both the local and EU level to address the need for existing and new digital skills that shall be required in nearly all jobs in the medium term. The digital market transformed several business models that Malta is accustomed to. This was expected to bring major changes within the labour market in a relatively short time. Despite general positive developments in terms of digital literacy, the need for a continued effort to narrow the digital gap further is key to the<a href="https://eskills.org.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx"> eSkills Malta Foundation</a>.</p><p>The National eSkills Strategy 2019–2021 put forward twelve main recommendation areas. The recommendations aim to support the business needs for the development of the Foundation to match the rapid pace of change led by market needs. The Strategy also aimed to develop a number of measures to support a more evidence-based decision-making process. In addition, the Strategy put forward several specific recommendations to address a number of currently developing market trends identified as part of the fieldwork done over the previous year.</p><p>The targets for these recommendations were measured by discussing the progress by the various stakeholders. A Strategic Consultative Committee (SCC) was set up to measure the progress of the strategy by the various stakeholders. </p><p>The implementation of the National eSkills Strategy 2019–2021 has been completed. To review the impact of the Strategy, the Foundation commissioned PWC to carry out an online survey among the academia, SMEs and society, which was followed by a number of interactive workshops with the various stakeholders involved in the strategy. The Survey results were extremely positive and encouraging for future development. The implementation of the National eSkills Strategy has contributed to specific digital transformations needed during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>The results of the survey and workshops will serve as the basis for the upcoming National eSkills Strategy 2022–2024, which is currently being drafted. The European Digital Decade and the Digital Education and Action Plan will influence the upcoming strategy. The ambition of the strategy is to further improve Malta’s position in terms of digital education and skills.</p><p class="subtitle">Development of Digital Skills in Compulsory Schooling</p><p>The <a href="https://digitalliteracy.skola.edu.mt/">Directorate for Digital Literacy and Transversal Skills (DDLTS)</a>, within the Ministry for Education, identifies gaps in the digital skills of educators and supports them accordingly. The DDLTS coordinates support for educators to make use of various technologies that are available in schools and include them in their lessons in order to engage the students and facilitate learning. Students develop their critical and confident use of technologies and their digital competence. The DDLTS organises many initiatives in education to promote digital literacy, coding and computational thinking (like family coding sessions and the Code Week), internet safety, eTwinning, SELFIE and the implementation of DigComp within compulsory education.</p><p>The <a href="https://education.gov.mt/en/Pages/educ.aspx">Ministry for Education </a>is investing in digital skills in compulsory education curricula through the creation of ICT infrastructures in classrooms. </p><p>In primary schools, digital skills have been strengthened through the One Tablet per Child (OTPC) scheme, where tablets were distributed to all students and educators in year 4, 5 and 6 in all schools. The tablet is aimed to be an educational tool that helps students to enhance learning in literacy, digital literacy, numeracy, science and other areas. Students can learn anytime, anywhere because the tablet facilitates collaboration, communication, creativity, character education, digital citizenship, critical thinking and computational thinking. These competences are pushed forward through the digital learning outcomes, which are aligned with DigComp. The OTPC project aims to increase the skills and competences of students and future graduates; and to ensure that all children will be given a fair and equal opportunity to become familiar with technology. Digital skills are cross-curricular at all compulsory levels and students are expected to use technology across all subjects.</p><p>The Directorate for Learning and Assessment Programmes (DLAP) launched a new ICT programme in middle schools, entitled <a href="https://curriculum.gov.mt/en/syllabi_as_from_sept_2018/Documents/Year_07_08/ICT_syllabus_C3_yr07.pdf">ICT C3</a>, which has been introduced in year 7, to replace ECDL. The new ICT C3 programme goes on until year 11 to ensure that students learn about safety on the net, robotics, coding and other new technologies. This is a compulsory subject in lower and upper secondary education. Computing, VET IT and applied IT are optional subjects which students can study at secondary level.</p><p>With regard to transforming teaching and learning of digital skills in a lifelong learning perspective, including the training of teachers, the DDLTS is mainstreaming the EU’s digital competence framework DIGCOMP (JRC, 2017) focusing on digital literacy and 21<sup>st</sup> century skills. The <a href="https://instituteforeducation.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Institute for Education</a> offers a whole range of CDP courses, including courses related to digital competences, in collaboration with the DDLTS. In the framework of the national project One Tablet per Child (OTPC), all educators in year 4, 5 and 6 have to follow the mandatory course ‘Award in the use of tablets in primary classrooms’. Professional development is also provided to all teachers involved in the ICT C3 programme, in computing, VET IT and applied IT.</p><p>The Ministry for Education has also started the implementation of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/education/schools-go-digital/about-selfie_en#:~:text=SELFIE (Self-reflection on Effective,into teaching, learning and assessment.">SELFIE</a> (Self-reflection on Effective Learning by Fostering the use of Innovative Educational Technologies) Tool, to help schools carry out a self-assessment when it comes to their digital footprint. This assessment is essential for the digital development of schools in terms of operational, teaching and student skills. SELFIE is a tool to help schools embed digital technologies into teaching, learning and student assessment. The free tool is available online and was developed by the European Commission with a panel of European education experts. The Ministry collaborated with the eSkills Malta Foundation to carry out a SELFIE workshop on 31 May 2019.</p><p class="subtitle">Digital Education at Further and Higher Education Level</p><p>The <a href="https://www.mcast.edu.mt/">Malta College of Arts, Science and Technology (MCAST)</a> and the <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/">University of Malta</a> teach digital and media literacy classes.</p><p>At the University of Malta, the AI department gives lectures to more than 5,000 students in secondary schools; a new syllabus has been launched whereby 5,000+ students will be trained during the summer months on AI concepts.</p><p>The <a href="https://education.gov.mt/en/Pages/National-Skills-Council.aspx">National Skills Council</a> collaborated with the MCAST on the <a href="https://www.mcast.edu.mt/wp-content/uploads/MCAST-AI-StrategyFinal.pdf">strategy for AI in VET education</a>.

Furthermore, during 2020 the MFHEA organised two webinars where various elements of digital education were discussed, including online teaching and learning methods, digital education methods in Malta and quality assurance of online teaching and learning. Moreover, in 2021 the MFHEA has been working with a foreign expert and a local expert to issue <a href="http://qualifications.ncfhe.gov.mt/#/more-database">guidelines for online learning</a> to all providers. These guidelines will be based on the outcomes of a survey which was disseminated to all education institutions in January 2021.</p><p>The Institute for Education is currently offering awards in the digital skills area. Anyone who meets the eligibility requirements can attend these courses. Such courses aim to upskill or help educators develop new competences.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.connectedlearning.edu.mt/">Commonwealth Centre for Connected Learning (3CL)</a> operates as a knowledge hub for a global network of groups, agencies, institutions, educators and activists interested in the rapid deployment of programmes for connected learning in the Commonwealth and the EU. The Centre is an international foundation set up by the government of Malta in collaboration with the Commonwealth of Learning, and is conducting research on the impact of blockchain, AI, augmented reality and big data on digital education. The Centre’s objectives are underpinned by three inter-related strategies: </p><ul><li>Action research: the Centre engages with academic and professional researchers worldwide and brokers participation in research areas. Strategic alliances are being developed with universities, higher education institutions, consulting firms and the labour market, primarily in the Commonwealth and EU Member States. The Centre will commission action research in strategic and ideally high-profile areas of interest that resonate with target stakeholders. Research findings will be published through peer-reviewed, third-party publications as well as 3CL‑branded research reports to be published online under the most current version of the Creative Commons Attribution International (CC BY) licence. </li><li>Praxis: the Centre facilitates, develops and shares high-profile pilots that can be replicated as use case studies. This process involves the activation and management of three interconnected pathways: peer-learning networks; connected learning principles and open education resources. Energised forms of digital scaffolding can shift the emphasis from policy discourse to praxis, helping learning institutions, teachers and learners acquire digital skills and learning methods. Providing learning support through the creation of relevant case studies can encourage education institutions to re-evaluate and implement much-needed change in curricula and modes of assessment.</li><li>Advocacy for capacity building: the Centre is an advocate for connected learning and more inclusive approaches to education. In the process it builds capacity as a virtual incubator, integrating skills from different institutions and collaborating on strategic projects with clear ‘needs’ and ‘wants’.</li></ul><p>Local tertiary-level education updated its curricula to include emerging technologies across all ICT curricula. New curricula were also introduced. This includes a new master’s programme on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) at the University of Malta run by the Centre for Distributed Ledger Technology. This programme includes streams for ICT, business and legal experts. The MCAST introduced a programme on business analytics. Various general public sessions are being done about blockchain, championed by the University of Malta. General public groups include students, accountants, game designers and other DLT stakeholder groups. In 2018, a course was also launched by the University of Malta on DLT which includes the technical, legal, business and application aspects of blockchain.</p><p class="subtitle">Malta Information Technology Agency Strategy (2021–2023)</p><p>The new Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) Strategy covers the period 2021 to 2023 and as a vision it is ‘Committed to a Digital Future’. The MITA does this by assisting the government in providing direction and implementing solutions in the digital sphere.</p><p>The strategy is based on seven domains. At the core is the provisioning of data centre facilities which host the government’s critical information systems and associated data, and the network infrastructure which provides a backbone for whole government. The second domain relates to information systems where the MITA designs, implements, maintains, and modernises both horizontal digital platforms and solutions, as well as vertical information systems used by the public administration. The third domain focuses on utilising innovative technologies and making the best use of data sharing and linking to facilitate projects such as Once-Only. </p><p>A key domain centres around information security, including the operations of a Security Operations Centre and the setting up of a National Coordination Centre. This domain also comprises Cyber Security activities and awareness programmes targeting different audiences.</p><p>The MITA always adopts a strategic approach, therefore this is another domain. The Agency assists the government both at a national and public administration level in drafting and setting up digital policies, strategies, and architectural roadmaps. The MITA represents Malta on various EU and national committees. </p><p>A sixth domain relates to the external environment. The MITA provides various consultancy and project management services and a suite of digital solutions, which are based on its knowledge, competences, platforms, and tools. The Agency establishes strong relationships with various stakeholders, internal and external to the government. Finally, the strategy presents an internal domain; just like any other organisation, the MITA has several internal supporting functions and processes that are integral to its work. </p><p>Supporting the seven domains is the most important asset that the organisation has, its employees. The MITA has excellent resources in different areas and takes measures to motivate, develop and recognise them and to provide an environment where they can deliver.<a id="_Toc1474960"></a></p><p class="subtitle">Digital Justice Strategy (2022–2027)</p><p>On 3 December 2021, the Maltese Ministry for Justice and Governance launched its new <a href="https://digitaljustice.gov.mt">Digital Justice Strategy</a> for the years 2022-2027. The strategy seeks to adopt a strategic framework to make further use of the available technologies, respect the rule of law and the substantive and procedural rights of all citizens. This strategy envisages that a more unified and coordinated approach amongst all justice entities will be achieved by the establishment of a set of guiding fundamental principles, which all digital initiatives within the justice sector shall adhere to. The strategy rests on 3 key strategy enablers, namely people, ICTs and processes for the alignment of strategic priorities in order to reach the strategic vision of ‘Improving the quality and the efficiency of justice through innovation, digitalisation and new technology whilst fully respecting the rule of law and guaranteeing the substantial and procedural rights of all citizens.’ The strategic goals based on Fundamental Justice Principles and strategic principles are:</p><ul><li>Digital by default;</li><li>Access to justice;</li><li>Analytical capabilities; and</li><li>Building digital skills and competencies.</li></ul><p>The strategy will be implemented in the period of 2022–2027 and will make use of technological building blocks available nationally and at EU level, amongst others. The action plans for the first 2 years have been designed and are being implemented. Considering the evolving nature of ICTs, action plans will be revised to take stock of the digital landscape at the time. Governance structures and the project management approach have also been setup to oversee the strategy implementation process.</p><p>Digital Tourism Roadmap</p><p>The aim of the Digital Strategic Roadmap is to set the course for meeting the goals of one of the 13 strategic challenges of the Malta Tourism Strategy 2021–2030: specifically, the one titled ‘Fostering cross collaboration across various digital tourism initiatives through the consolidation and better use of data’ (page 42). The goals are:</p><ul><li>Consolidate and use quality data to improve access to digital information and valuable knowledge that will advance the local product;</li><li>Invest in new technologies to enhance tourist experience through the offer of more customer centric services;</li><li>Nurture digital cross collaboration initiatives across public, private and non-profit organisations to strengthen the tourism sector and provide a holistic experience to visitors;</li><li>Facilitate the smart use of emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, supercomputing, 5G network and augmented / virtual realities amongst others, to increase the value of digital tourism products;</li><li>Incentivise innovation to attain a competitive advantage over slower reacting competing destinations; and</li><li>Facilitate the industry to invest in upskilling its staff to address today’s demands and technologies.</li></ul><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><h3>Artificial intelligence (AI) </h3><p class="subtitle">Malta Government’s vision on Artificial Intelligence</p><p>In October 2019, the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation launched Malta’s <a href="https://malta.ai/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Malta_The_Ultimate_AI_Launchpad_vFinal.pdf">National AI Strategy</a>, with the aim of Malta becoming the ultimate AI launchpad where companies and start-ups can develop, test, implement and scale their products locally and then springboard them into the world.</p><p>The Strategy is built on three strategic pillars: investment, start-ups and innovation, public sector adoption and private sector adoption. Each pillar draws on three strategic enablers: education and workforce, legal and ethical framework, and ecosystem infrastructure. Based on the work done by the taskforce which was entrusted to design the strategy, over 70 actions and policy measures were established, with the aim of Malta becoming one of the countries with the highest-impact AI strategy in the world.</p><p>The <a href="https://mdia.gov.mt/">Malta Digital Innovation Authority (MDIA)</a> is entrusted with overseeing the implementation of the strategy. The Authority has kickstarted the pilot projects detailed in the AI Strategy, which caters for the public sector adoption in sectors such as transport, education, water and energy, customer service, healthcare and tourism.</p><p>The MDIA is currently working with each project stakeholder involved in ensuring a thorough implementation of the actions detailed in the strategy. Moreover, the authority has engaged with project stakeholders that are conducting research to digitise the Maltese language in a way that computers will be able to process, understand and generate Maltese text and speech, with the main aim to have AI solutions accessible in both of Malta’s national languages. To further support the national AI Strategy, work is being dedicated to have a technology roadmap which will enable technological and data infrastructures to form part of the holistic AI Strategy across all use cases. Additional to this, an implementation plan is being set out for a list of subsequent projects which together will help further reach the objectives and goals presented in the AI Strategy.</p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies </h3><p class="subtitle">Scholarships on Blockchain and DLTs</p><p>On 28 August 2018, a <a href="https://www.um.edu.mt/dlt/scholarships">scholarship</a>, forming part of an agreement between the University of Malta and the MITA, was launched in the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary for Financial Services, Digital Economy and Innovation. The scholarship covers a EUR 300,000 fund launched by the government over a three-year period, and which shall enable interested students to pursue their studies in blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs). This initiative is seen as a pillar in education to build upon the amount of skilled workforce that will be required to sustain the large number of DLT companies which have shown their interest in investing in Malta and which are willing to base their companies in Malta, following the country’s legislative developments on DLT. During the first two years of the scheme, 19 students have been granted the scholarship.

In fact, as a general rule all data are to be made available free of charge save for the exception to charge for marginal costs; and</li><li>In view of the above the Recast Directive also emphasises the importance of avoiding clauses in public contracts prohibiting the re-use/sharing of data. </li></ul><p>The provisions of the Recast Directive were transposed into Maltese Legislation on 2 July 2021 through an Amending Act to Cap. 546 of the Laws of Malta. </p><h3><a id="_Toc1474965"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p class="subtitle">eID Regulation</p><p>Malta was one of the first Member States to legislate in eCommerce by transposing the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&amp;from=EN">eSignatures Directive</a> into national law in 2001.

Besides the substantive provisions related to public procurement, and the provisions related to purely electronic tools such as Dynamic Purchase Systems and Electronic Auctions, the Regulations, and specifically LN352 of 2016, provide that all procurement procedures conducted by a contracting authority be performed using the government eProcurement system. </p><p>Subject to specific conditions, all communication and information exchange, including electronic submission, must be performed via electronic means of communication. The authority responsible for the tendering process shall, by electronic means, offer unrestricted and full direct access free of charge to the procurement documents from the date of publication of the notice or the date on which an invitation to confirm interest is sent.</p><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing Legislation</p><p>The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/MT/TXT/?uri=OJ:L:2014:133:TOC">eInvoicing Directive 2014/55/EU</a> was transposed into <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/cefdigital/wiki/display/CEFDIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Malta">local legislation</a> via Legal Notices 403 and 404 of 2018, were published on 30 November 2018. The Directive mandated central government, government entities, local councils and regional authorities able to receive and process invoices electronically. Whilst the central government was mandated to be able to receive and process eInvoices by April 2019, other government entities, local councils and regional authorities were mandated to comply with the Directive by April 2020.</p><p>As part of the process, the <a href="https://mfin.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Ministry for Finance</a> and Employment (MFE) embarked on various local and EU initiatives. An eInvoicing Committee was chaired by the MFE with the participation of the Treasury, the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/">Malta Information Technology Agency (MITA) </a>and other local representatives of the central government to oversee the smooth implementation of the Directive for central government, government entities and local councils. For government entities and local councils, the MFIN, together with the <a href="https://economy.gov.mt/en/Pages/Home.aspx">Ministry for the Economy and Industry (MEI)</a>, launched a National eInvoicing Forum to promote and implement eInvoicing. At the EU level, Malta participated in the European Multi-Stakeholder Forum on Electronic Invoicing (EMSFEI). </p><p>The European Standard, emanating from the European Directive on electronic invoicing for public authorities (2014/55/EU), defines a semantic data model for a core invoice, compliant with this Directive. The data model of this European Standard contains many optional elements. However, specific countries, groups, or organisations may create individual specifications for the core invoice model, known as Core Invoice Usage Specification (CIUS), in their respective domains. One of the organisations that created an individual specification for the CIUS is OpenPEPPOL, which created the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0. Following a thorough business impact assessment of the core invoice data model as established by the European Standard, the government of Malta will be adopting the PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 as its own CIUS, with no changes. To be able to do this, government decided to become an <a href="https://peppol.eu/about-openpeppol/">OpenPEPPOL</a> end-user member.</p><p>The adoption of the PEPPOL CIUS guaranteed a high degree of interoperability since several Member States adopted this CIUS or based their local CIUS on the PEPPOL model. It means that the government will incorporate the PEPPOL CIUS in its systems and will be able to receive eInvoices through the PEPPOL eDelivery network. Joining OpenPEPPOL was an important part of Malta’s strategy to support compliance with the European eInvoicing Directive (2014/55/EU), making it easier for businesses to engage with the government online. </p><p>The Maltese government promoted the adoption of eInvoicing in its <a href="https://digitalmalta.org.mt/en/Documents/Digital Malta 2014 - 2020.pdf">Digital Malta National Strategy 2014–2020</a>. There is currently no eInvoicing platform in place in Malta. The <a href="https://treasury.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Treasury Department</a> within the Ministry for Finance and Employment (MFE) is working on implementing a new Corporate Financial Management Solution (CFMS) across the central government, alongside an eInvoicing PEPPOL-compliant platform linking suppliers to the solution.

In this regard, the government of Malta, through the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/">MITA</a>, has continued to invest heavily in this sector. This was done in order to continue providing the best infrastructure hosting of the government’s public-facing portals. A new <a href="http://www.gov.mt">portal</a> hosting platform was launched in 2019. The new platform is based on Microsoft SharePoint 2016 and aims to offer an out-of-the-box solution to the government for the address of non-standard branded sites. </p><p>The government of Malta's <a href="http://www.gov.mt/">portal</a> is an institutional site providing comprehensive and meaningful information on government ministries, policies and services. Government services and information are structured according to the needs of specific citizen groups/events. An A-to-Z list of government websites can be accessed through the portal. In late 2018, the gov.mt website and the sub site doi.gov.mt, were reorganised and relaunched with a new brand. The government of Malta has its official pubic-facing website at www.gov.mt. In the past this website used to be a gateway for all the necessary information and links about public administration services. This role has now been taken over by <a href="https://digiplace.sharepoint.com/sites/WE-EUROPEANCOMMISSION-ABCIV-SC442/Shared Documents/D04.01 Digital Public Administration factsheets and infographics/Country factsheets 2021/Malta/Factsheet/servizz.gov.mt">servizz.gov’s</a> website.</p><p class="subtitle">Servizz Website</p><p>The <a href="http://servizz.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">Servizz.gov</a> Agency is the government’s one-stop shop for the general public, and www.servizz.gov.mt is now the central website for public administration services. Through this website, the public can look up services categorised by sector. The purpose of establishing such sectors was to simplify the categorisation of services, since now they are linked to a sector which is not bound to change, rather than to a specific ministry which is highly subject to change. The website also offers the possibility for the public to report complaints and excessive bureaucracy, make suggestions and request information. A customer relationship management solution is the infrastructure behind the IT system where all cases are processed against service level agreements and investigated in the most efficient manner. Services that were previously provided on www.mygov.mt now feature on <a href="http://www.servizz.gov.mt">www.servizz.gov.mt</a>. </p><p>The former eForm landing pages were also consolidated within the servizz.gov portal in a homogeneous manner. The servizz.gov portal relies on the eForms platform to load the various services that the public requires. The forms on the eForms platform enable information to be collected once at source and are subsequently electronically distributed to the respective government entities. The eForms platform is also integrated with other electronic services, namely the <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/portfolio/information-systems/government-payment-gateway/">Government Payment Gateway (GPG)</a>, electronic identity (eID), SMS notifications and Microsoft Exchange for email notifications.</p><p class="subtitle">Data.gov.mt Website </p><p><a href="https://data.gov.mt/">Data.gov.mt</a> is the National Data Portal. It acts as the main entry point to data discovery and consumption for all official registers. It is designed to be the one-stop-shop for all data discovery and meta-data management matters, thus requiring that all meta-data for all registers be made available through the Register of Registers and other Data Governance registers. It has two main sections, namely (i) the Open Data Portal; and (ii) the Internal Data Sharing services.</p><p>The National Data Portal is also expected to serve as a link with the European Data Portal for harvesting of local datasets, including those related to open data for publication on a European scale. Any data generated through taxpayer’s contribution and classified as Open Data should be made available for re-use by any person or organisation without any barriers or other obstacles, following the 5-star deployment scheme for open data. Indeed, where possible, the portal displays the contents of official registers which are classified as open data. However, when such data are not readily available, a facility within the portal is needed to submit online formal requests. Such requests for open data would need to follow a legally determined process, having various stages of redress in cases of refusal. </p><p>On the other hand, the National Data Portal also caters for the official registers which contain certain sensitive or personal information, and therefore cannot be published as open data. These data are therefore only available to predefined specific roles where the appropriate authentication and authorisation is required in order to gain access. Consequently, the portal also facilitates sharing and re-using such public administration data across authorised entities, as required by their functions. </p><p class="subtitle">Government Intranet for the Public Service</p><p>The MITA offers a <a href="http://intra.gov.mt/">collaborative platform</a> which is also based on Microsoft SharePoint, for document management, collaboration and intranets. This platform is widely used within the government but most notably it is used for the government Intranet for the Public Service – intra.gov.mt. The Intranet for the Public Service is available to all government departments/entities and their employees. Through a collaboration site, intra.gov.mt provides any participating government department/entity the facility to share activities such as document management and workflows that address the internal business requirements of the specific department or entity. The platform holds information in the form of circulars, news, events, directives, newsletters, vacancies, management resources, courses and scholarships and is restricted to public service officials.</p><p class="subtitle">Data Protection Portal</p><p>Apart from the <a href="http://www.dataprotection.gov.mt/">portal</a> of the Information and Data Protection Commissioner, an intra web presence accessible through the <a href="https://intra.gov.mt/en/Pages/default.aspx">government intranet</a> came into operation in February 2006, and enabled data protection officers to have access to guidelines and templates to ensure that government processes are compliant with the GDPR. As of May 2018, the Data Protection Unit, now within the <a href="https://justice.gov.mt/en/Pages/justice.aspx">Ministry for Justice, Equality and Governance</a> (MJEG) revamped this web presence and took the decision to open up this portal to all officers with access to the intranet, so that all guidelines were available to all and not limited to data protection officers.</p><p class="subtitle">Judiciary of Malta Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://justice.gov.mt/en/justice/Pages/The-Judiciary-in-Malta.aspx">portal of the Judiciary of Malta</a> provides the public with extensive information resources on the Maltese judicial system, the judiciary, judges and magistrates, as well as the courts they sit in. It offers a latest news section and an insight on the history of the Maltese judiciary and the important judgements that have been pronounced.</p><p class="subtitle">eCourts Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://ecourts.gov.mt/onlineservices/">eCourts portal</a> is divided into three categories, namely facing the public, citizens and legal practitioners. The advantage to the public is that they have access to all eServices related to the courts of justice from one website that is mobile responsive. The advantage to legal practitioners and citizens is that they can access additional services through their eID that are not available to the general public without having to go physically to the courts. Services that are available to the public include civil cases, judgements, the insolvency register, judicial sales, hall usage, mobile notifications, payment of court fines and court registry fees. Other services that are available to the citizen are: Archive of Acts, My Cases and My Acts and those available to legal practitioners include: online submission of acts, searching of acts, warrants, civil forms and the interdiction and incapacitation register. </p><p class="subtitle">Legislation Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.legislation.mt">Legislation Portal</a> is the main portal that makes all Maltese legislation available online, including the consolidated chapters of the laws of Malta, and primary and secondary legislation amongst others. Legislation.mt currently conforms to Pillar 1 of the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) and work is ongoing on Pillars 2 and 3. </p><p class="subtitle">Notarial Acts Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.notarialacts.gov.mt">Notarial Acts Portal</a> provides the ability for the general public and notaries to procure public deeds online from the comfort of their home. The portal was launched in June 2020 and is currently available online. </p><p class="subtitle">Arbitration Portal</p><p>The <a href="https://www.arbitration.mt/">Arbitration Portal</a> is meant to allow citizens to file and follow arbitration cases through this portal. Arbitration payments may also be made online through the portal. The portal is currently available online and will soon be launched.</p><p class="subtitle">Freedom of Information Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.foi.gov.mt">Freedom of Information Portal</a> provides online facilities to make Freedom of Information Requests.</p><p class="subtitle">Kultura Malta Portal</p><p>The <a href="file:///C:/Users/barbb004/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/WJATEWK0/Kultura.mt">Kultura.mt Portal</a> acts both as a cultural calendar for all public cultural events and as a common online ticketing platform for all public cultural organisations, providing a harmonised user experience to customers.</p><p class="subtitle">myHealth Portal</p><p>The national <a href="https://myhealth-ng.gov.mt/">myHealth Portal</a> is an online service that enables the continuation of patient care between public and private healthcare providers. Through this portal, citizens are placed in control of their health record, and can give their private general practitioner access to their patient health records such as laboratory and radiology results, case summaries, pharmacy of choice, medicines entitlement, prescriptions and dispensing records, vaccination records, historical episodes of care, future outpatient/clinic appointments at government hospitals and health centres, and copies of notifiable infectious disease forms sent by doctors through myHealth. Through this portal, private general practitioners are also able to order blood test and radiology tests for their patients.</p><p>Use of the portal has grown steadily. Today, there are 780 private GPs are accessing 150,000 different patient records. New online services are being made available through myHealth on an on-going basis.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474990"></a>Recruitment Portal</p><p>In 2018 a <a href="https://recruitment.gov.mt/en/page/home">new Recruitment Portal</a>, featuring the Public Service website design, was launched. This new responsive website replaced the previous legacy recruitment portal, which was later decommissioned following an extensive backup process. A mobile app titled Join the Public Service, which is connected to the new recruitment portal, was launched in mid-2018. Its aim was to alert the general public about job opportunities related to areas of their interest within the public administration. </p><p>Business Portal</p><p>The Business Portal is earmarked to change the current one-stop-shop concept, whereby businesses will get to access multiple services from a single online interface. Thus, all the requirements associated with starting, running and closing a business would be addressed through a single interactive intelligent portal that would automatically and seamlessly submit data to the various stakeholders and deliver services online in a timely manner. </p><p>By following the Once-Only principle, the Portal will ensure that data and information provided to government entities are consistent and accurate and the duplication of data is avoided. In addition, through the use of modern technologies, the portal will enhance user experience whilst utilising Artificial Intelligence (AI) practices such as the clustering business behaviour and predictive analytics, identify future business and functional requirements, and request and provide targeted information on the regulatory framework or recommend services and incentives relevant to the particular end-user.</p><h3>Subnational portals </h3><p class="subtitle">Local Government Portal</p><p>The <a href="http://www.localgovernment.gov.mt">Local Government Portal</a> aims to provide holistic information about the local government in Malta. With a view to empower the role of local councils and assist citizens in easily accessing council services, a dedicated <a href="http://www.mylocality.gov.mt">sub-portal</a> provides information specific to individual local councils and regional committees. The main objectives for the creation of this web portal were to encourage local councils to effectively interact with the community in general and to provide international users with a valuable tool, allowing them to better understand the geo-cultural composition of the Maltese Islands and the relevant specificities. The portal also promotes the advantages of standardisation, opening the channels of locality-based prioritisation and differentiation.</p><h2>Networks</h2><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Hlk507071848"></a>Next Generation Access</p><p>Malta is the European leader in Next Generation Access (NGA) broadband access as confirmed in European DESI reports. The Malta Communications Authority plays an important role in facilitating and nurturing a healthy and competitive business environment and infrastructure-based competition.</p><p class="subtitle">MAGNET</p><p>MAGNET was implemented in 1995 as the MAlta Government NETwork that connects all government ministries, departments and agencies, as well as local councils, police stations, libraries, hospitals, health centres, social services offices and embassies. This network enabled the government to disseminate IT and information society applications such as email, the internet, and corporate applications like the Common Database (CdB) and the Departmental Accounting System (DAS) to help facilitate and improve the efficiency of the public service. The availability of this network enabled the government to launch its eGovernment services. A new network, “MAGNET II”, was launched in July 2005 and partly replaced MAGNET. This new state‑of-the-art network presented a number of benefits for users compared to its predecessor. In particular, MAGNET II provided enhanced bandwidth per site, offered better reliability through strict service level agreements (SLAs), guaranteed 99.8% minimum site availability and was fully secure through extensive encryption.</p><p>In 2015, MAGNET III was launched to provide cost-effective connectivity services to the government. By the end of 2016, all MAGNET II sites migrated to the MAGNET III infrastructure. Whilst retaining the strong features of MAGNET II, the MAGNET III infrastructure offered flexible bandwidth in accordance with client business needs. Another major benefit of MAGNET III was the network’s ability to enable video calls efficiently and effectively between all connected organisations. A government-wide intranet became available to all entities connected to the network. The Malta Public Service Intranet allowed document exchange and sharing across ministries and departments. By the end of 2020 around 250 sites were connected to MAGNET through this fibre-based network, with an additional 400 sites ca. connected to the broadband-based portion of this network.</p><p class="subtitle">Government Core Network Upgrade</p><p>The <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/">MITA</a> core network infrastructure located at the MITA’s two Data Centres and interlinking them together, is the junction through which all network traffic originating from any government site is transported through MAGNET, to its intended recipient. The core network infrastructure is a fundamental building block on which the MITA can provide a wide variety of government services, thanks to its robustness, high availability, high speed, high capacity and security measures.</p><p class="subtitle"><a id="_Toc1474991"></a>Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations</p><p>Malta uses the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/solutions/testa_en">Trans European Services for Telematics between Administrations (TESTA)</a> network as the main cross border infrastructure to communicate digitally among EU agencies, institutions and Member States.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p class="subtitle">Maltese Government Common Database</p><p>The Maltese Government Common Database (CdB) was enhanced with some minor amendments. An ongoing effort is being made for the simplification of processes by internally sharing data and re-use previously gathered information, in line with the Once-Only principle. </p><p class="subtitle">Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure</p><p>The European Commission saw the need to enhance the cyber security capabilities of Member States, specifically the requirement to create an open platform incorporating the necessary tools to facilitate collaboration among National Computer Security Incident Response Teams at a European level.</p><p>Through the <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/open-platform-and-tools-to-facilitate-the-collaboration-among-computer-security-incident-response-teams">Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) – Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure Maintenance and Evolution of Core Service Platform Cooperation Mechanism for CSIRTs</a>, the European Commission developed the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/funding/call-tender-advance-melicertes-facility-used-csirts-eu-cooperate-and-exchange-information">MeliCERTes platform facility</a>, now in its second upgraded and improved version. </p><p>The Malta CIP Directorate (CIPD), within the MHSE together with other local authorities and agencies, participated in the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/2017-mt-ia-0057">Cybersecurity Digital Service Infrastructure</a> (DSI) programme which is part of the European Strategy for Cybersecurity. The MeliCERTes platform provides an information sharing for operational cooperation among Computer Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). Action points provided by local stakeholders were to:</p><ul><li>Establish a direct access point between CSIRTMalta (the national CSIRT) and MeliCERTes. The other beneficiaries - MT-CSIRT and CIS - will share information through CSIRTMalta;</li><li>Increase the preparedness of CSIRTMalta, CIS, MT-CSIRT and other CSIRTs for the requirements and tasks arising from the NIS Directive, including training of beneficiaries' personnel; and</li><li>Provide review reports to the EU Commission to improve MeliCERTes functionality and security features. </li></ul><p>These actions are in line with Malta’s National Cybersecurity Strategy and the MeliCERTes platform, being the national platform where local entities exchange data at the national level and with their European counterparts. </p><p class="subtitle">Data Exchange between Critical and Relevant Entities in Malta</p><p>Critical Information Infrastructures (CIIs) and Digital Service Providers (DSPs) within Malta are required to implement security measures in line with the direction provided by the NIS National Competent Authority, namely the CIIP unit, within the CIPD, MHSE. To facilitate collaboration between the different stakeholders, CSIRTMalta introduced several innovative tools including NaTech (Natural Hazards Triggering Technological Disasters) and MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) as Data Exchange Mechanisms for OSPs and DSPs, as well as CIs and CIIs to exchange information online in real-time and in automated format. As a result, stakeholders are now in a better position to share information about cyber incidents and threats more effectively. </p><p class="subtitle">Notifications Service </p><p>As part of the eGovernment strategy to enhance citizen communication, the government of Malta invested in an <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/en/eGov/DevelopmentToolkit/eGovServicestoolkit/Pages/Development-Toolkit---Notification-Services_b.aspx">eGovernment Shared Service (eGSS)</a>, the Notifications Service, to enable a one-way communication channel between government, citizens and businesses. The Notifications Service provides a gateway for messaging both by SMS and emails, allowing citizens to be notified of various government services instantly.</p><p>Through a purpose-built web-based portal, public entities and ministries are able to send notifications to citizens using their services. Messages can be sent either individually or in bulk, using SMS or email as delivery channels.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474992"></a>eID and Trust Services</h2><p class="subtitle">eIDAS Node</p><p>In 2018, Malta was one of only four Member States that successfully met the regulatory deadline for the recognition of other Member States’ eID schemes under the eIDAS Regulation. As the operator of Malta’s eIDAS Node, the MITA was successfully certified following a TickITplus ISO9001 and ISO27001 audit, and the Node was set in full production mode in July. The German middleware was successfully integrated in the environment in September, enabling the mandatory recognition of the notified German electronic identity scheme. This placed Malta as one of the top-running Member States in the adoption of the eIDAS Regulation and facilitated the early development of cross-border services. In 2019, Malta succeeded in integrating with its eIDAS Node Infrastructure all those notified Member States for which the deadline for recognition by Malta was October 2019, namely Belgium, Luxembourg, Estonia, Croatia, Spain and Portugal. In 2020, Malta actively participated in the working groups set up to define the technical specifications of the Once-Only exchange mechanism to be implemented for the Single Digital Gateway Regulation. </p><p>In 2021, work commenced on the implementation of the eDelivery Access Points to work with the Once-Only Technical System of the Single Digital Gateway. The deployment of the access points on the pre-production environment are completed and successfully passed a connectivity test with the European Commission. Work is under way with the European Commission to provide SDG core services on a staging environment to commence integration to the core services.</p><p class="subtitle">National Identity Management System </p><p>The existing <a href="https://identitymalta.com/id-cards/">National Identity Management System (NIDMS)</a> aims to support <strong>core identity management</strong> <strong>processes,</strong> including the issuance of electronic identity cards (eID Card), ePassports, biometric visas and residence documents. The government operates a number of identity management systems, the most important of which are: core database systems, electronic identity (eID) infrastructure, an electoral system, a national identity card system and the passport system. However, it should be noted that these and other disparate information systems are not entirely interoperable.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identity</p><p>To keep the eID solution secure, robust and stable for eGovernment service continuity, the MITA approved in 2014 a technology upgrade for the solution that included a migration to a newer and fully supported hosting platform, and an alignment of the software development platform to recent versions. The technology upgrade included the first phase of simplification of the authentication mechanism through the introduction of a new single sign-on screen for a harmonised user experience and additional security. In parallel, several high-level consultations were held to discuss the potential successive phases of simplification.</p><p>The technology<strong> </strong>upgrade for the eID solution was completed in 2016. The migration to the new environment resulted in a noticeable improvement in performance and stability and was achieved with no disruption to the subscribers and the relying parties. The new single sign-on screen was also launched, following a complete re-engineering of the user interface and functionality to achieve the desired simplification. This simplification in the user experience was accompanied by a complete overhaul of the registration and activation processes where the reliance on the PIN letter was removed in favour an electronic activation process. Several eGovernment services, notably servizz.gov, eForms, myHealth, taxation, Automated Revenue Management Services (ARMS) and social security have since lined up to integrate with the new screen to achieve the desired outcomes.</p><p>In 2017, the MITA completed the final phase of the simplification of the eID authentication mechanism, which envisaged an alignment of the assurance levels to achieve a basic assurance level using the eID account and password, and a high assurance level using the ID card and PIN. This provided a better choice of usability or security for subscribers and relying parties. The basic assurance level was intended to have a password with reduced mandatory complexity with an optional one-time password. The high assurance level potentially involved additional usability challenges in view of the initial set up and installation of the ID card, but still provided the additional security required.</p><p>In 2018, Identity Malta together with the MITA addressed the priority technical gaps of the eID system with the GDPR.</p><p>In 2019, an optional two-factor authentication mechanism for eID based on a time-based one-time password (TOTP) mechanism was introduced, intended for specific eGovernment services which require a substantial level of assurance. Support for the OpenID Connect Protocol to facilitate better access from native mobile applications was also introduced. </p><p>In 2020, Identity Malta together with the MITA upgraded the eID Account Management functionality to further align eID with the GDPR and to provide users with additional visibility and control over their eID account. The new Account Management screen includes an updated user profile with activity tracking and overhauled help facility. It allows for changes of password, email address and mobile number including corresponding verification. It also allows users to switch on two-factor authentication using either their email address, a mobile or app platform for receiving the TOTP.</p><p>The achievements made and the on-going work on the eID system mean that the government has a stable and reliable platform for electronic authentication to enable eGovernment services at a local level, with different levels of assurance providing the required choice between usability and security. Future initiatives will include notifying the Malta eID scheme/s, under the eIDAS Regulation, to facilitate cross-border authentication with other Member States.</p><p class="subtitle">Electronic Identity Cards (eID Card)</p><p>The eID Card is an identity card which, in addition to the traditional identification features, also includes an electronic component which allows citizens to access an array of electronic services provided by the government and other third parties.</p><p>Maltese nationals who are 14 years of age and older are entitled to an eID Card. The card’s electronic features are available to all card holders with one exception: the signature certificate is only available to citizens aged 18 years and older.</p><p>Residents who are not Maltese nationals, yet who are eligible for a residence document or a residence permit, will have, through electronic documents, the same eID features as the eID Card. Specifically, EU nationals, spouses of EU nationals and regular third country nationals residing in Malta have the same eID features and accesses as Maltese nationals.</p><p>The electronic chip of the eID card holds the same biographic data that are visible on the face of the card, including a digital image of the citizen. The chip includes two digital certificates for authentication and signatures, and applications for ticketing and electronic purse.</p><p>The digital certificate for authentication enables the citizen to log in securely to eGovernment services. The digital certificate for signatures is an enabler for electronic signatures. These are qualified certificates under the eCommerce Act and the electronic signature will be equivalent to a hand-written signature. Both certificates are protected by different Personal Identification Numbers (PINs).</p><p>The eID Card can be used by citizens to securely access their health information through eGovernment services but does not hold any sensitive health data. An eID account is required to access health information through the myHealth Portal. No fingerprint biometric data is held on the eID Card, which does not replace the voting document issued by the Electoral Commission, either.</p><p class="subtitle">ePassports</p><p>Passports issued as from the 1 October 2008 are all ePassports. These first generations of electronic passports had a BAC (Basic Access Control) chip. The biometrics captured were a photo image and a signature. As from 1 July 2010, the ePassports’ chip was upgraded to EAC (Extended Access Control). Fingerprints were added to the biometrics captured.</p><p>On 30 March 2015, the ePassports’ chip was upgraded to SAC (Supplemental Access Control). However, the same biometrics were captured as the chip is the latest third generation to date.</p><p>The main reasons that led to the introduction of an ePassport were to:</p><ul><li>Prevent fight passport fraud;</li><li>Reduce passport forgery;</li><li>Facilitate more robust border controls; and</li><li>Establish a link with the lawful owner.</li></ul><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">Electronic Public Procurement System Platform</p><p>The <a href="https://www.etenders.gov.mt/epps/home.do">eProcurement Solution</a> procured by the government of Malta is the electronic Public Procurement System (ePPS) platform, which is supplied by European Dynamics S.A. The platform was launched in July 2011 to facilitate the Maltese government’s transition to online procurement, covering the full lifecycle of public procurement. The Solution constituted an eProcurement platform that comprised a core and a number of eProcurement-specific services, offering several parameterisation capabilities for meeting the exact needs of a purchasing authority.</p><p>The eProcurement solution enables actual tender bids to be submitted securely online using the most common procedures, such as the open procedure and framework agreements, as well as other more specific procedures, such as the negotiated procedure, the competitive dialogue, the restricted procedure and concessions. The system also caters for new and unique procedures such as eAuctions and the Dynamic Purchasing System. All procedures can be either evaluated using the lowest price, cost or best price-quality ratio mechanisms. The platform is currently used by the Department of Contracts (Malta’s Central Government Authority), the sectoral procurement directorate, which represent different contracting authorities within that Ministry and individual contracting authorities that form part of the public sector.</p><p class="subtitle">Department of Contracts Portal</p><p>Since the launch of the eProcurement platform for Malta, the <a href="http://contracts.gov.mt/en/Pages/Home-DepartmentOfContracts.aspx">Department of Contracts Portal</a> has taken a different role. Rather than being an interactive site for economic operators to learn about and participate in tender opportunities, it now serves as a window for procurement regulations and policies across the government. Essentially, all Public Procurement Regulations, Contracts Circulars, Procurement Policy Notes (PPNs) and Manuals of Procedures are available to all. Furthermore, there are also links to all the tenders published between 2008 and 2012, when the <a href="https://www.etenders.gov.mt/">National eTenders Portal</a> took over as the site for tender opportunities, and other procurement resources like awards (1999-2017), plus the Department’s annual reports on the workings of the General Contracts Committee (GCC).</p><p class="subtitle">MITA Procurement Website</p><p>The MITA, the other Central Purchasing Body besides the DoC, maintains a <a href="mailto:https://procurement.mita.gov.mt/">procurement-dedicated website</a> that allows greater interaction on its public calls for tenders through a mobile responsive design. The website also provides an outlook forecast on upcoming calls for tenders scheduled to be issued by the agency, and provides procurement-related resources, including those related to the dynamic purchasing systems established by the agency.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474995"></a>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">ePayment Gateway</p><p>The eGovernment <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/portfolio/information-systems/government-payment-gateway/">electronic payment gateway</a> is part of the horizontal infrastructure supporting the Maltese eGovernment.

The service is provided both as standalone, hence portals or mobile applications that directly integrate to the gateway, or through other set platforms, such as eForms.</p><p>The service grew from a mere 7 600 transactions in 2003 to 892 211 in 2020, a year that saw transactions worth a total of EUR 159.4 million and an increase of more than EUR 11 million over the previous year. The setup offers stability and security. Its contracted availability is 99.85% per month and handles eight transactions per second. In the past 12 months, the government of Malta continued to strengthen this vital setup through the following initiatives:</p><ul><li>3D secure enabling for all merchants;</li><li>REST API stack provision to widen the services for mobile payments including continued eWallet support for merchants;</li><li>Introduction of merchant-initiated transactions;</li><li>Continued strengthening of the infrastructure; and</li><li>Facilitating integration through revised and refreshed documentation.</li></ul><p>This was done to continue to instil trust in the payment gateway with the aim of increasing uptake and usage.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474996"></a>Knowledge Management</h2><p class="subtitle">Malta CIPD CEF Sponsored Cybersecurity Training and Certification</p><p>Throughout 2020, the Malta Critical Infrastructure Protection Directorate (CIPD) within the Ministry for Home Affairs, National Security and Law Enforcement (MHSE) invested over four hundred thousand euros (EUR 405,785.00, excluding VAT) in EU Funds through the CEF European funding programme to deliver specialist Cybersecurity training to local experts from within the public and private sectors in Malta. The training provided local specialists with certifications in cybersecurity topics, penetration testing, digital forensics of electronic devices as well as malware analysis, amongst others. </p><p class="subtitle">My Personal Kiosk</p><p>​<a href="http://www.mypersonalkiosk.gov.mt">My Personal Kiosk</a> is the eAdministration service launched in 2018 to provide public service employees with the opportunity to access their leave balances (sick and vacation), view their payslips and FS3 for the last three years. Additionally, employees can check their basic HR details as currently available at the People &amp; Standards Division. The service is sourcing information from the back-end HR and payroll systems.</p><p class="subtitle">The Malta Public Service Intranet: Intra.gov.mt</p><p>The intranet for the public service is available to all government departments/entities and their employees. Intra.gov.mt, through a collaboration platform, provides any participating government department/entity the facility to share activities such as document management and workflows that address the internal business requirements of the specific department/entity. Amongst others, the intranet holds information such as circulars, news, events, directives, newsletters, vacancies, management resources, courses and scholarships and is restricted to public service officials. All the eAdministration services launched in 2018 are included on the intranet.<a id="_Toc1474997"></a></p><h2>Cross-border platforms</h2><p class="subtitle">Deployment of Cross-Border eHealth Services </p><p>Since 2019, Malta has been live with cross-border eHealth services. Between 2017 and 2020, the deployment of these services was supported by CEF funding for the implementation of <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/inea/en/connecting-europe-facility/cef-telecom/2015-mt-ia-0060">eHealth Digital Service Infrastructure</a> (eHDSI) generic services. CEF funds helped Malta set up the necessary infrastructure for structured exchange of health data between Malta and other EU Member States by means of interoperable cross-border eHealth services. Malta forms part of the secure peer-to-peer eHDSI network, through which patient summaries can be exchanged between EU Member States. These services were thoroughly tested and audited before going live in 2019.</p><p>The systems developed during the implementation of these services are connected to the national eHealth infrastructure. Since December 2019, Malta has offered live services for the exchange of patient summaries through its National Contact Point for eHealth (NCPeH) in the Ministry for Health; the first services deployed have been with other ‘first wave’ countries, i.e., Luxembourg, Portugal, and Croatia. Services with other EU countries will start when these countries are ready for deployment.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474998"></a>Base registries</h2><p class="subtitle">Contracts Register</p><p>The Maltese government has embarked on the implementation of a Contracts Register based on the <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/">World Bank’s Open Contracting Data Standard</a> and has now also fully implemented the electronic integration of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single-market/public-procurement/e-procurement/espd_en">European Single Procurement Document</a> (ESPD) and integration with <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/tools/ecertis/#/homePage">eCERTIS</a> and National Registers. The first is a significant statement on transparency, whereas the second continues to automate processes and enshrines the Once-Only principle. </p><p class="subtitle">Person Register</p><p>A Legal Notice is currently in the process of being established for the implementation of a Person Register, which shall provide measures to facilitate sharing and re-using personal data between public sector bodies and enable the link between the core person details record and other records held in other official registers containing equivalent personal data in relation to the same person. The implementation of this base register also aims to enable the Once-Only principle within government. In addition to modernising the existing solutions, improving user experience, harmonising the approach for system-to-system integration, eliminating dependency on legacy systems and taking advantage of the benefits brought by with the introduction of new technology, another objective of the Person Register is to extend the scope of the existing functionalities. These include accepting personal details updates from different life events across government as detailed within the Legal Notice. The initial development works on the Person Register are planned to initiate in 2022.</p><p class="subtitle">Business Register</p><p>The Business Register project is currently undergoing the final testing phase by both internal users from MBR and external users such as practitioners and CSPs. The planned go-live is June 2022.</p><h2>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Applied Research </p><p>The MITA has set up a new applied research function with the purpose of using existing knowledge and technologies in an innovative way to address business problems within the MITA or public administration. These initiatives will be used as a vehicle to develop proof of concepts and promote the further take-up of emerging technologies. Where applicable, the MITA will make resources available through the Emerging Technologies Lab to provide projects with the necessary backing. The aim is to increase the use of technology for the benefit of citizens and businesses. Since the technology would not have been applied in such a way before, developing the proof of concept will be the first step to take the project forward for actual implementation. The knowledge gained will be used as input for the justification of the project or the adoption of alternative methods. Independent from the decision on whether to proceed with project implementation, the knowledge gained by the MITA, public administration, and partners can be used to solve other similar problems. In addition, investments in such an initiative will strengthen and increase the research and innovation aspects of the Country.</p><p class="subtitle">Launch of the Emerging Technologies Lab</p><p>Following the launch of the MITA <a href="https://mita.gov.mt/portfolio/engagement-with-community-bringing-digital/emerging-technologies-lab/">Emerging Technologies Lab</a> in October 2018, with an investment of EUR 250 000, the lab has provided an opportunity to explore and learn emerging technologies. With the purpose of promoting the various technologies available at the lab and increasing the knowledge on these technologies, during the first two years of operations more than 50 events have been organised at the lab. In 2020 most of these events have taken place online. MITA employees, government employees, students, as well as private sector start-ups have the opportunity to develop their ideas in areas such as virtual and augmented realities, robotics and IoT through the use of 3D printing and microcontrollers, AI and distributed ledger technologies. </p><h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><h3>Distributed ledger technologies</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><h3>Big data </h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><h3>Cloud computing</h3><p class="subtitle">Hybrid Cloud Platform (HCP)</p><p>The MITA operates a <a href="https://cloud.gov.mt/overview/">Hybrid Cloud Platform (HCP)</a>, a hosting solution entirely developed and maintained in Malta for all government entities. It is based upon an on-premises stack, which is hosted within the MITA Tier3 datacentre for Malta-based operations, and an off-premises cloud linked with Cloud Service Provider’s data centres within the EU. The two parts of the hybrid cloud are connected to provide a single enterprise environment, therefore allowing services offered from the on-premise cloud to integrate with public cloud services (and vice-versa), and be scalable across clouds. The HCP is also connected to the secure and high-speed Malta Government Network, allowing integration with other government systems hosted on traditional virtual hosting platforms.</p><h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><h3>High-performance computing</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><h3>High-speed broadband connectivity</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field was reported to date.</p><p><img src="img/35-774.jpeg" alt="A picture containing text, computer, person, indoor
