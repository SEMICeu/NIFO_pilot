The picture below represents the three pillars of the EIF around which the EIF Monitoring Mechanism was built to evaluate the level of implementation of the EIF within the Member States. It is based on a set of 71 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) clustered within the three main pillars of the EIF (Principles, Layers and Conceptual model), outlined below.</p><p><img src="img/35-212.png" alt="35-212.png" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>For each of the three pillars, a different scoreboard was created to breakdown the results into their main thematic areas (i.e. the 12 principles of interoperability, the interoperability layers and the components of the conceptual model). The thematic areas are evaluated on a scale from one to four, where one means a lower level of implementation and 4 means a higher level of implementation. The graphs below show the result of the second EIF Monitoring Mechanism data collection exercise for Liechtenstein in 2020. </p><p>	<img src="img/35-221.jpeg" alt="35-221.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Liechtenstein’s results in Scoreboard 1 show an overall fair performance in the implementation of the EIF Principles, despite the lack of data for Principles 6 (User-centricity), 9 (Multilingualism) and 10 (Administrative simplification). Potential areas for improvements concern the implementation of Principles 2 (Inclusion and Accessibility), 4 (Reusability) and 12 (Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency) for which the scores of 1 and 2 show lower and lower-medium performances in the implementation of corresponding recommendations. For instance, concerning Principle 2, the publication of the data as open data unless certain restrictions apply (Recommendation 01), the maintenance of a level playing field for open source software while considering the use of open source software (Recommendation 02), as well as the use of open specifications, taking due account of the coverage of functional needs, maturity and market support and innovation (Recommendation 03) are only scarcely implemented and could be improved to reach scores aligned with the EU average.  </p><p><img src="img/35-230.jpeg" alt="35-230.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>The results of Liechtenstein in Scoreboard 2 illustrate a fair performance with scores of 3 and 4 in almost all layers. Liechtenstein’s areas of improvement concern the better implementation of the recommendations related to the interoperability governance, the integrated public service governance and the technical interoperability layer. Particularly, Liechtenstein scores 1 in the consultation of relevant catalogues of standards, specifications and guidelines at national and EU level, in accordance with the country’s NIF, when procuring and developing ICT solutions (Recommendation 23) and in the use of open specifications to ensure technical interoperability when establishing European public services (Recommendation 33). The lower performance in the implementation of these recommendations hampers the overall results of Scoreboard 2 for Liechtenstein.</p><p><img src="img/35-241.jpeg" alt="35-241.jpeg" /></p><p>Source: European Interoperability Framework Monitoring Mechanism 2020</p><p>Liechtenstein’s scores analysing the Conceptual Model in Scoreboard 3 highlight an overall good performance in the implementation of recommendations associated with the conceptual model, the internal and external information sources and services as well as base registries. However, areas for improvements concern the implementation of recommendations related to open data, and privacy and security. More specifically, Liechtenstein has only marginally implemented all the recommendations related to open data. Furthermore, in the area of security and privacy, the use of trust services according to the Regulation on eID and Trust Services as mechanisms that ensure secure and protected data exchange in public services is only partial and could be improved.</p><p>Additional information on Liechtenstein’s results on the EIF Monitoring Mechanism is available online through <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/nifo-national-interoperability-framework-observatory/eif-monitoring">interactive dashboards</a>.</p><h2>eGovernment State of Play </h2><p><em>This section of the factsheet is meant to present the country’s performance on the main eGovernment indicators according to the latest </em><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/egovernment-benchmark-2021"><em>eGovernment Benchmark report</em></a><em>, which monitors the development of eGovernment in Europe. </em></p><p><em>At the present moment the report does not analyse the state of play of eGovernment in Liechtenstein.</em></p><p><img src="img/35-253.jpeg" alt="A group of people holding cell phones

The government’s main objective is continuous optimisation in terms of process efficiency and customer-friendly design for the national administration. This applies to administrative processes as well as to the concerns and needs of the population, companies and other stakeholders. In the course of this legislative period, a series of measures will strengthen the service of the State administration with a strong focus on electronic means of communication. The programme presents decisive opportunities and addresses some primary challenges posed by digitisation. </p><p>The Digital Agenda is a central field of action for the legislature. There is a general consensus that administration services should be offered electronically and made available around the clock. In this context, there is also awareness that when official business is conducted via electronic means, data security and privacy must be a high priority. </p><p class="subtitle">eGovernment Strategy 2019-2023</p><p>The <a href="https://www.regierung.li/media/attachments/ikr-eGovernmentStrategie-A4-D.PDF?t=636911057929590704">eGovernment Strategy</a> is based on the knowledge gained from the implementation of an earlier strategy dating back a decade. In March 2019, the government presented its overarching considerations for future digitisation and formulated concrete fields of action articulated in objectives and measures. The new revised eGovernment Strategy includes a vision, principles and guidelines for the implementation of digital services as well as defined areas of action. The strategy will be implemented by means of individual projects.</p><p>Although the State administration relies heavily on eGovernment, citizens continue to enjoy non-electronic access to all administrative services. However, eGovernment should facilitate access to administrative services and make business transactions more efficient. The administration thus enables a customer-friendly, personal and competent service, both electronically and non-electronically.<a id="_Toc1474952"></a></p><h2><a id="_Toc1474959"></a>Interoperability</h2><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2>Key enablers</h2><h3><a id="_Toc1474953"></a>Access to public information</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474954"></a>eID and Trust Services</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474955"></a>Security aspects </h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474956"></a>Interconnection of base registries</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h3><a id="_Toc1474957"></a>eProcurement</h3><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474958"></a>Domain-specific political communications</h2><p>No political communication has been adopted in this field to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474960"></a>Emerging technologies</h2><p class="subtitle">Blockchain Partnership</p><p>On 1 February 2019, the Principality of Liechtenstein signed the declaration on joining the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/liechtenstein-joins-european-blockchain-partnership">European Blockchain Partnership</a>.

In April 2018, the government commissioned the Office of Information Technology to implement a new electronic identification (eID) system for Liechtenstein, underlining that it was important for the new system to be interoperable with other European eID systems. After the preliminary work and studies, an international tender was carried out in spring 2019. The Office of Information Technology implemented the new eID in two phases. During the first phase, the technical implementation of the new eID.li had to be ensured and the existing online services had to be converted to the new eID.li. Applicants for an eID were identified and registered by the Aliens and Passport Office (APA) at the counter. This phase was completed in spring 2020. During the second phase, the administration set up an alternative procedure for the registration of natural persons. In particular, this meant enabling the onboarding of international clients, for example by means of video identification, as well as the integration of government-related and private web services. This phase was launched in spring 2020. </p><p>Following the implementation of the new eID.li, the government started a project for the integration of the service with private parties. An example is the use of eID.li to access eBanking.</p><h3>Subnational portals</h3><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2><a id="_Toc1474993"></a>Networks</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2>Data Exchange</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2>eID and Trust Services</h2><p>No particular infrastructure in this field has been reported to date.</p><h2>eProcurement</h2><p class="subtitle">eInvoicing</p><p>The eInvoicing infrastructure was implemented in 2018 based on Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2017/1870. </p><h2>ePayment</h2><p class="subtitle">Paymentwall</p><p>Based on the Digital Agenda of Liechtenstein of March 2019 and the subsequent eGovernment Strategy Liechtenstein of April 2019, the Office of Information Technology was commissioned by government resolution BNR 2019/458 to take over the implementation of the technical services from the eGovernment strategy.
